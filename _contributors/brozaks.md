From New York, New York, Sonia Brozak graduated with a double major in Art History and Medieval & Renaissance Studies and a minor in German. She undertook two thesis projects, one of which deals with appropriationist art of the 1980s and the other looks at conceptions of spatial mapping in Early Modern Florence. She has spent time abroad in MÃ¼nster, Germany; Florence, Italy; and Paris, France improving her German, Italian, and French. Sonia served as the Secretary of the Student Body at Washington and Lee and is a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority. In her spare time, she enjoys spending time with friends and reading The New Yorker.

Sonia helped to establish and refine the project's initial goals, from the planned nature of the VR experience, to the educational benefits of the 2D mapping aspect. She contributed research pertaining to Florence that appeared in her senior thesis, worked on the 2D map alongside Miles Bent and Dave Pfaff, and translated Paatz's German notes on the Bigallo.
