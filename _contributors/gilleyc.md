Colby Gilley is from the humid hamlet of rural Molino, FL. While he naturally gravitated towards humanities classes at W&L, he was enamored by all facets of the human experience. While at Washington and Lee, he pronounced his investment in the Universityâ€™s community, serving as a member of the FYOC, a University Big, and a leader on the Friday Underground team. Colby appreciates dusty old bookstores, the scent of wisteria on April evenings, and the sound of a reverberated guitar.
