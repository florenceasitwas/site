Hailing from the humid hamlet of rural Molino, FL, Colby Gilley is a current sophomore at Washington and Lee University. While he naturally gravitates towards humanities classes at W&L, he is enamored by all facets of the human experience. His potential major is still undeclared, but he has pronounced his investment in the Universityâ€™s community, serving as a member of the FYOC, a University Big, and a leader on the Friday Underground team. Colby appreciates dusty old bookstores, the scent of wisteria on April evenings, and the sound of a reverberated guitar.
