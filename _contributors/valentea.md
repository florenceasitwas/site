Aidan Valente graduated in 2019 with majors in Medieval & Renaissance Studies and Art History and a minor in Classics. On-campus, he spent much of his time working on Digital Humanities projects involving the University's Special Collections archives, where he worked during the summer of 2016. In Fall semester 2017 he was appointed to the Digital Humanities committee. Outside the classroom, he enjoyed participating in Catholic Campus Ministry, rehearsing with the University Singers, and seeing plays at the Blackfriars in Staunton with the Shakespeare Society.

Aidan worked mainly on the website--design, organization, troubleshooting, and general maintenance. He also translated documents to and from Italian, and contributed essays, such as the ones he wrote for the Bigallo. Upon graduation from W&L, Aidan first attended Cambridge University, where he received his M.Phil in art history, and then proceeded to the University of Chicago, where he is currently working toward his Ph.D.
