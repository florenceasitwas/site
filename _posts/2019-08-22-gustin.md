Just one more week until the new semester gets properly underway! Alice and I are finishing some of the big projects - the Siena chapel and San Miniato - before we're once again swamped with schoolwork. <!-- more --> Professor Bent is here with me today, working on the San Miniato point cloud, so hopefully we'll be able to stitch together the photogrammetric facade with the interior point cloud - which you can see [here](http://3d.wlu.edu/model/miniato2.html).

Beyond that, I've been very busy with making further changes to the website; if you look at the ["3D models" page](/3d_models.html), there should be embedded Sketchfab and Potree models along with explanations on how to use them - that page will need a lot of tweaking, but it's a good start, because we don't just use Sketchfab now!

Another thing: we've begun adding the Borbottoni paintings to the 2D map. For now, we just have locations - you can't see the paintings themselves at those locations yet - but ideally we'll have it so that you can click on a highlighted street corner and immediately see the Borbottoni painting associated with it, an illustration of what you're looking at.
