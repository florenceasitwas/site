Hello, World!
I'm Aidan Valente, the fourth student contributing to the Florence as it Was project at the moment. Like Sonia, I'm an Art History and Medieval & Renaissance Studies double-major.
<!--more-->
The focus of my work so far has involved constructing and modifying the site for the project, the results of which you can see before you.
In particular, most of my efforts thus far have revolved around the blog aspect of our site. Because the project has only just begun, we don't yet have a large amount of academic content to display online. Rather, up until this summer, when Sam and I will actually begin photographing and researching in Florence, this site will focus on our blogging, which serves as a sort of chronicle of what we've done.
