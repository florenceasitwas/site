      <p>Welcome to Florence As It Was, a digital project that aims to reconstruct the city the way it appeared at the end of the fifteenth century. Here you can review, inspect, tour, and visit the streets, palaces, churches, shops, and offices that formed the fabric of one of Europe’s most vibrant cities. Here you will find images, people, payments, relationships, literary references, contemporary descriptions, and sometimes even music related to the individual structures that shaped a Florentine’s daily experience in 1500. </p><p>Here you can read, in English, the Italian and German interpretations of these people and places that were written by critics and scholars in the 17th, 18th, and 20th centuries. See the seat of government and power in the late Middle Ages. Walk through the streets and buildings where Cosimo de’ Medici spent much of his time. Examine the most important cult painting in the city and the tabernacle that framed it. Zoom in close, fly high above, or approach these places from below. Search for names, places, dates, and events, and see how links and connections can be made in unexpected ways. Above all, imagine.
      </p>
      <p>There’s a lot of information and a lot of data in these sites, so have patience while they load. It’s worth the wait.</p>

			<h3>Bigallo</h3>
			<p>Built in c. 1360, the Oratory of the Misericordia, as it was then known, has endured expansions, fires, renovations, a merger, and more to become the elegant structure that stands on the Piazza del Duomo today. Read more about the structure's tumultous history here. Explore the headquarters of one of the city's most prominent charities, the Confraternity of the Misericordia, later merged with that of the Bigallo, and see the art that it commissioned to assert its place in Florentine society.</p>

			<h3>Orsanmichele</h3>
			<p>View the monumental statues produced by Florence's leading sculptors for the city's guilds, which were commissioned to decorate this grain market-turned-church. One of the city's grandest examples of the Medieval and Renaissance connection between religion, politics, and art, the granary and later church of Orsanmichele has an extremely complex history. To help make sense of it, we've collected some sources here for edification.</p>

			<h3>Santa Croce</h3>
			<p>Located on the site of a facility that had housed early followers of St. Francis as early as 1212, the enormous mendicant church was initiated in 1295 thanks to plans crafted (according to legend) by Arnolfo di Cambio. Despite its location in the midst of laborers engaged in the messy, dangerous, and thankless work of wool production, the friary catered to the spiritual interests and needs of some of the city’s wealthiest elites.

			<h3>The Loggia of the Bigallo</h3>
			<p>Florence As It Was' first 3D model is that of the Loggia of the Bigallo, one of Florence's most visible structures on the Piazza San Giovanni and a physical reminder of the city's rich Medieval past. The structure housed charitable organizations that ministered to orphaned children, poor unwed girls, the homeless, and pilgrims on the way to and from Rome. These confraternities sponsored the creation of some of the city's most unique art in order to decorate their residence and proclaim their importance in the fabric of Florentine society. And like much of Florence's past, the Bigallo has undergone significant changes—changes that we hope to unravel, peeling back the layers of time to find the Medieval city that gave birth to the Italian Renaissance. The Bigallo, then, is a perfect starting point for our work, and a snapshot that captures the essence of Florence As It Was.</p>
			<p>Sam Joseph created the model using thousands images (which he took with a point-and-shoot camera and a tripod over the summer of 2017) and pieced it together using a process called photogrammetry. For future models, we hope to gain access to a high-resolution drone for detailed exteriors and a laser scanner for interiors.</p>

                <h3>Po-tree or Potree?</h3>
                <p>Hello all, my name is Ellie and I’ve just begun working on the FLAW team. I write this as I again attempt to understand the workings of Potree.  For now, I am learning the basics, such as adding to the site and embedding links within the models. This week, we luckily got an awesome tutorial from alumnus Win, who helped demonstrate how to add annotations and images into the models. With plenty of essays ready to be embedded into models such as the Bardi chapel, it is just a matter of figuring out how to do so. However, for the meantime I will hold off from working within the actual models and stick to my practice copies.</p>

<p>We have elected for our next meeting to be online, following suit with many recent
University adjustments. 
For the coming weeks, in order to move forward with larger projects, 
Georgie and I will continue to become versed in the 3D models and the site inventory.</p>

<p>Lesson of the week: if at first you don’t succeed, po-tree, po-tree, po-tree again.</p>

<p>EP</p>
