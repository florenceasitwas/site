<h1>Richa, Orsanmichele</h1>

    <p><strong>Translation:</strong> Jorge Gomez</p>

<h2 id="historical-news-of-the-florentine-churches-first-three-lessons-of-the-madonna-of-orsanmichele">Historical News of the Florentine Churches: First Three Lessons of the Madonna of Orsanmichele</h2>

<p>First Lesson:</p>

<p>There are many miraculous images of Mary in Florence, among which the most glorious was always that of Or S. Michele. This was probably due to the multiplicity of the centuries, or because of the quantity of miracles, or the quality of the honors. I would like to address all three of these privileges here in this lesson. But first, I would like to speak of his sovereign Tabernacle and the sublimity of its design and the marbles’ richness surpassing all human estimation. Moving me to do this is the lack of much valuable information left out by Francesco Bocchi, Giovanni Cinelli, and Filippo Baldinucci, who all wrote about this Oratory. Furthermore, Giorgio Vasari could have written much more about it in the life of Andrea Orcagna.</p>

<p>However, I will begin by reporting what he briefly wrote, as follows: “Soon after having the men of the Company of Or S. Michele put together many denari of alms, and goods that were donated to that Madonna after the plague of 1348, they resolved to make around her a chapel, or Tabernacle, not only carved in marble but also from other precious stones of immense value, like mosaic and bronze, as much as could be desired. So much so that by labor and by matter every other work was advanced until the point that the grand work was made. Being the most excellent of that age, all the work was given to Orcagna. He made so many designs until one finally pleased the patrons, and they deemed it better than all the others; whereby they entrusted the work to him, they left everything to his judgment, and to his advice. He then gave several carving masters from several places all the decorative things that needed to be done and waited with his brother (Nardo di Cione) to produce all the figures of the work. When everything was finished, he had them bricked up, and made them together very considerably without mortar with spliced copper bars, so that the polished and clean marbles would not get stained, which he did so well with profit and honor, that to those that came after him and considered his work, it seems that the whole chapel of Orcagna was quarried from a single piece of marble due to its unity and joints. And although the chapel is of a Gothic manner, it holds the first place among the things of that genre and time due to its grace and proportion, and especially the composition of large and small figures, the angels, and the half-relief prophets placed so well around the Madonna. The casting of the diligently cleaned bronze enclosures is also marvelous, which, going around the whole work, encloses and squeezes it together so that it remains no less vigorous, strong, and beautiful than in all the other parts.</p>

<p>But how much he worked to show the subtlety of his ingenuity in that great time can be seen in a large half-relief narrative in the rear part of said Tabernacle. This half-relief contains figures one  and a half braccia (about 100 cm) long which depicted the twelve Apostles  looking at the Madonna while surrounded in an almond tree by two angels in the sky. In one of those Apostles, he portrayed himself as old, with a shaved beard and a hood wrapped around his flat head and  round face. In addition to this he wrote these words underneath in marble: “Andreas Cionis Pictor Florentinus Oratorii Archimagister exstitit bujus 1359.” Up to this point Vasari said nothing about the variety of precious marbles and the very rare stones, nothing about the many beautiful figures and statues, and nothing of the mysteries portrayed in the bas-reliefs; on the contrary, by mentioning the blessed ascended Virgin Mary, he makes a mistake by saying that the apostles look at the Madonna ascended to heaven. There are two low reliefs (not one) divided into two pictures, the first of which above shows the Ascended Virgin surrounded by Angels among some trees worked with rare finesse at the bottom of the scene. In the second section from below, which has nothing to do with the one above, we see the dead Madonna surrounded by the Apostles, and it is true that Orcagna portrayed himself, but not yet old, as the aforementioned Writer said since the good craftsman died in 1389 at age of 6o. Therefore in 1359, the year in which the Tabernacle was completed, he must have been 30 years old without any more.</p>

<p>Here, I would like to start making up for the things of this Chapel that the writers left out. First, I would like to notice the beautiful design of this work with its measurements made by Orcagna’s own hand. Even after 400 years, the very well preserved design may be seen in the famous Library of ancient manuscripts of the former Senator Carlo Strozzi. Thanks to the courtesy of Mr. Carlo Tommaso, his worthy grandson, we have a copper engraving of the design.</p>

<p>Now coming to the exact description, in the corner of the loggia towards the middle, the reader will see a niche adorned with various marbles, as high as a step and three braccie (about 200 cm) wide. This niche goes around the Tabernacle covered by a domed grandstand and surrounded by a rich balustrade, resting at the end of a staircase also made of marble.  In the four corners of the gate worked with bronze arabesques there are four pedestals, which support a spiral column, on whose top there is a statue representing an Angel. These columns are four and three-quarter braaccie high, and the Angels are one and one fourth. Then after this noble balustrade, inside rises the much-commended Tabernacle supported by four pillars, each of which has nine columns that are three and a sixth braccie high, and a quarter large, between each of them you can see hard stones shining with an abundance of lapis lazuli – not only in the pillars, but in the bases and in the arches of the Dome, as well. Twelve are of the Prophets, which are one braccia high, and half turned on the architrave, each having a sign that expresses the virtues of the Virgin Mary. Then there are four spiers made in the Gothic style, six and an eighth braccie high without the base, which in the middle they place the dome six and a quarter high, and in the highest of it is an Angel two braccie tall. The vague arabesques and the very fine marble leaves are extended everywhere in such a manner that they are considered miraculous. Finally, eight mysteries are represented in the base of the grandstand in graceful bas-reliefs. These are of the Nativity of Mary, her Presentation in the Temple, the Marriage with Saint Joseph, the Annunciation, the Epiphany, the Circumcision, and in the eighth, according to the ancient tradition, an Angel who brings to the Virgin a palm leaf as an announcement of Christ’s death.</p>

<p>In the middle of such a remarkable grandstand above the rich altar surrounded by beautiful relief angels there is a painting, famous and adored all around the world, of the image of the Virgin Mary, called the Madonna of Or S. Michele, the most powerful advocate of the Florentines. Giulio Mancini, a modern Tuscan author, argues in one of his essays about paintings that this image was painted by the Sienese painter, Ugolino di Nerio.  I will report here a scholarly defense from Baldinucci written during the life of Orcagana. It states as follows: “We will add lastly that the modern writer, of whom we spoke a little while ago, believed that Vasari made a mistake to have affirmed that the sacred image of the Virgin Mary, which adorned this Tabernacle, was made by the hand of Ugolino who died in 1349, being that the image was painted in 1284. It did not seem likely to him that in 1284 Ugolino could have been well educated in painting and that he could have painted such a work. Furthermore, the style of the painting was more akin to a Byzantine painting than to a contemporary Florentine one. Finally, the image is wooden, and Vasari says that the image that originally hung on the column in the loggia was made by Ugolino. But if we consider well, the Author’s argument cannot hold. First, Vasari in his first edition says that Ugolino died not in 1349 but in 1339, and in both the first and second editions he states that Ugolino died in a decrepit age. Therefore, if we count well, in 1284 he could have been at least 30 or 35 years old, and consequently in the prime of his work. Secondly, Vasari says in both editions and in open letters that Ugolino worked in a Byzantine style and that he always stubbornly kept to these ancient ways, even though many painters of his time - including Giotto himself – worked in a much better manner. For this reason, we must say that the painting is the hand of Ugolino. That she may be on wood or on the wall may then be typo by the printer. Instead of writing “he made the image of our Lady FOR a pillar of the loggia” he wrote “IN a pillar”.</p>

<p>And even when Vasari had said so, we still find that he and many of those who wrote about the lives of painters, used to say that a painting was made in a church, but it is not necessarily made for said church. Thus, Vasari having said this, Ugolino making Our Woman in the pillar does not prevent us from being able to believe that he meant that Ugolino had made the image into a wooden painting to get the measurements right and then for that panel to be placed on the pillar. The doubt then seems to be reduced to a mere cavillation.</p>

<p>Having accomplished this and having the obligation to trace all the most noteworthy things in this chapel, I will go on to discuss the singular privileges of the Most Holy Image. I must observe that ascribing to the painting its performance of sensational miracles to the year 1292 – despite being the one noted by Giovanni Villani – is incorrect. I find that the distinguished Company of the Madonna of Or. S. Michele had begun in 1291, which would presuppose that before some time the miraculous painting was already in great place on the pillar. Therefore, it seems more likely that the holy painting was placed on the pillar soon after 1284, the year the loggia was built. Hence it is now about 460 years old, counting only from 1291, the start of the company.</p>

<p>And here I would like to make a not contemptuous reflection on a marvelous combination of two sanctuaries which were formed at the same time and became famous all over the world. For precisely at this time, when in our image, heaven opened a source in Florence or rather a river of grace, the angels brought the House of Nazareth from Palestine to Italy. And if Pontiffs, Emperors, Kings, and Princes made the Lauretan temple magnificent, the Florentine Republic alone, as we shall see later, not wanting to spend immense treasures, built the Madonna of Or. S. Michele, one of the most splendid and superb churches. As the Book of the Reformations stated “Un fiat Beatissime Virgini Marie S. Michaelis in Orto templum splendidissimum, &amp; supra modum splendidissimum”. Pilgrims came to the Holy House of Loreto from all parts of the world, and even people from different parts of Europe came with very large offerings and vows to venerate our Image, thus writing to Pope Urban V in 1364 “Ad quod sere concurrunt homines de variis Mundi partibus”.</p>

<p>And after such a beautiful digression, returning to our Image, I must not forget to mention things about the Company of Or. S. Michele, like the most authoritative document demonstrating the antiquity of the miraculous painting. There is no better way of doing this than by summarily reporting the old chapters of the statutes written in the fourteenth century, and communicated to me by the scholar and courteous Mr. Domenico Maria Manni, the prologue of which is as follows:</p>

<p>“In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. And to the honor and reverence of Our Lord Jesus Christ, and of His Most Holy Mother Madonna Santa Maria always Virgin, and of Blessed Santo Michele Arcangelo, &amp; of Blessed Santo Lorenzo, and of the whole Court of Heaven, and to the honor and reverence of the Holy Church of Rome, &amp; of Our Lord the Pope, and of his Cardinal Signori Friars, and of the Bishop of Florence, and to the status, honor, and maintenance of the City of Florence, and its district, for the good and consolation of the Poor. These are the Chapters, and the orders of those, which are and will be of the said Company, which was begun in the years of the Incarnation of Our Lord Jesus Christ, MCCLXXXI. the day of Blessed Santo Lorenzo in the month of August.”</p>

<p>Three writers penned forty chapters in the confraternity’s statutes that confirm the high veneration that different peoples had for this institution. 
  In the first one we must recall the manner which was used to console the hordes of peoples who asked to be enrolled in the company. This confraternity employed a notary obligated to solemnly stand at the desk every day to register the names of the brothers and sisters who were enrolling. However, since there were too many to accommodate, the step was taken to have foreigners and those from the countryside registered alongside citizens as soon as they entered through the city’s gates. And with a rare example we find in chapter XXXVII that even the dead were ascribed to the company as long as one brought the name of the deceased to the notary. As written in the book, his soul became a participant in the suffrages of which grace was given. The policy was marked with the confraternity’s seal of the Annunciation and with these words written around it: Sigillum Societatis Virg. Marie Sancti Mich. in orto de Florentia.</p>

<p>I will discuss everything that the company did under the Loggia in the second chapter, but here I will instead talk about the sacred pillar, since in those early times of the statute’s creation the Oratory was not mentioned. In every evening, lauds were sung by the Laudesi brothers. During the eve of the feasts of the Lord, of Mary, of the Apostles, and of the Holy Advocates of the City, these lauds were sung with greater solemnity, making a general illumination of the whole Loggia in the preceding night. On all Sundays of the year and other solemn days, a sermon was delivered in the Loggia by preachers chosen by the Clergy to preach in the late afternoon hours, after Vespers. Throughout the day, four assiduous guards were kept at the pillar and then two at night to receive offerings of wax, clothing, money, and alms, which were more abundant since they were made at night. Finally, in the third chapter it is pertinent to talk about the examples of charity and piety that the brothers gave to the city and to the county.</p>

<p>Most devout in the Company were the processions of the Carmine and the Nonziata, which each year visited two of the following churches: S. Marco, S. Spirito, S. Croce, and S. Maria Novella. The order would restart every three years with the offering of a one-ounce candle for each brother. Each Monday six masses were celebrated in various churches for the deceased brothers. This was done so that each dead brother would have at least one mass said for him during the year, in which an officer of the company had to attend and pay twelve coins to the Priest. However, the most common gifts were general alms, besides the daily ones, and which took place in all the districts of Florence and its county. Indeed, it was the happiest day of the whole year for the poor, among which were included all the monasteries, hospitals, prisons, and hermits, being found in the books of the company, as charitable donations sometimes reached the sum of 37,000 lire, which helped the fame of Or. S. Michele and its company grow.</p>

<p>And, as I have done in the book’s other chapters, allow me to quote the title which can be read at the beginning of another book, called Green Champion, as follows: “Codex bonorum piissima Societatis Gloriosissime Virg. Maria S. Michaelis in Orto, merito in toto Orbe re &amp; fama memoratissima, ob suum devotissimum Oratorium sub famoso Templo , ac supramodnm Eminentissimo, eius nomine fundatum pariter &amp; sonstrutum.”</p>

<p>By having invoked the miraculous image of the Madonna of Orsanmichele, located on the pillar in the loggia, we may now refer to the multiple miracles it performed with so much abundance. Giovanni Villani interrupted the flow of his chronicle with the story of the painting’s amazing powers, writing: “On the 3rd of July 1292, great and open miracles began to be shown in the city of Florence for a figure of S. Maria painted in one of the loggia’s pillars of Or. S. Michele, where wheat is sold, the sick are healed, people are captivated, and miracles were performed in large quantities.” S. Antonio affirms the same in the third part of his story, as follows:</p>

<p>“Eodem anno (1292.) mense Iulii patrata sunt quadam miracula Florentia ex quadam Figura Virginis Gloriosa, qua erat in pariete picta atrii, seu horti S. Michaelis, ubi tunc forum erat frument, &amp; aliorum bladorum. Nam concepta devotione ab omnibus ad Figuram illam infirmis devote orantibus, plures sanati sunt exvariis languoribus, claudi erecti, contracti sanati, &amp; obsessi a doemonibus liberati.”</p>

<p>In the same year (1292), the image of the Glorious Virgin that appears on the wall of the court of Orsanmichele, the market for corn and grain, performed a miracle in the month of July. Answering the devout prayers of the people, the sick were healed, the lame walked, and those possessed by demons were freed.] Sozomeno from Pistoia wrote about this in his general history of the world, which is preserved in the library of the regular canons of the abbey of Fiesole. As Father Antonio Zaccaria writes about the aforementioned story: “Anno 1292. Die 3. Mensis Iulii Figura picta B. Virginis Maria, qua erat in horto S. Michaelis fecit multa miracula sanando infirmos &amp; elaudos, unde fuit maxima devotio totius populi &amp; finitimorum, &amp; tantum aucta est, quod singulis annis distribuebantur sex mille libbra, &amp; usque ad hodiernum diem extat devotion” “In the year 1292. On the 3rd day of July the figure of the Blessed Virgin Mary, located in the garden of Orsanmichele, performed many miracles by healing the sick and the lame, and it is venerated to this day” All the Tuscan writers speak of it this way, but none that I know of tell of how this miraculous painting was saved by Sig. Neri Abati in 1304 and thus was unharmed by the fire in Florence of that year, which burned not only the adjoining houses, but the loggia itself. Additional miracles that the painting performed can be observed in Orsanmichele’s stained glass windows, which some believe were the first to be made in the city after the secret was brought to Florence from Flanders.</p>

<p>The quantity and quality of the miracles performed by the Madonna of Orsanmichele provoked responses that I must report. The first derived from theologians and professors of divinity, who were not convinced of the powers of the painting or swayed by the stories they were told – but who were probably simply jealous of the devotion it received. They urged people to reconsider its power, which caused the Masters of Theology to be accused of envy over the pure zeal they were showing to the glory of God and Mary.</p>

<p>St. Antonino (Bishop of Florence, 1446-1459) wrote about it in the third part of his story, scathingly rejecting the accounts of Giovanni Villani and of other writers. Antonino’s words are as follows: “Fratres’ autem Predicatores &amp; Minores, quia parum fidei dabant dictis miraculis, Populus, qui leviter movetur, eis detrahebat, &amp; obloquebatur contra eos, adscribens invidia, quod erat vera pietatis” “Because the Friars’ Preachers and Minors (Dominicans and Franciscans) properly gave little credence to the miracles which had been reported, the people (who were unpersuaded by them) drew away from the clerics and insulted them by claiming their protests were driven by envy.” But the stupendous abundance of miracles contradicted the aforesaid critique. At all hours the painting attracted the impoverished and the sick, along with curious strangers who wished to witness supernatural events, and their prayers of thanks filled the air with a thousand blessings. So it was then that the Loggia, intended for the sale of grain, was instead frequently encumbered by the crowd of devotees, so much so that the Signoria was forced to close the loggia – but I am not sure of the year. It was then transformed into a church, but not without serious regret and opposition from several citizens of the Great Council, who lamented the alternations that compromised the beauty of the most majestic place in Florence, which we will describe in due course.</p>

<p>The very large sums that were donated to the guardians of the pillar were the direct result of the many miracles performed there. I will now report on only one of these many rich offerings. It was the one that the Florentines made in 1348 (the year of the great plague) recorded in the ledgers kept by the captains of Or. S. Michele, which ascended to a sum of 35,000 gold florins that, as Matteo Villani reported, was an incredible treasure due to the value of the money then. This was an offering so large that none like it had ever been made to another sanctuary of its time.</p>

<p>But since we have recalled the merits of this image’s antiquity and miracles, reason has it that we speak of the honors received both publicly and in private. To avoid recounting the long series of ordinations made by the Republic regarding the cult of our Lady, I have chosen some of the most memorable ones, which are high marks of honor to this Oratory, and will discuss other solicitudes of the Signoria in another lesson in order to place the Loggia alongside the most commendable works of Architecture, Sculpture, and Painting. The act that increased the devotion of the painting, along with the holy tabernacle, occurred when she was declared by the republic as a special advocate of the Florentines: the sound of the great bell, customarily rung to recognize grave resolutions, summoned people to the great Piazza dei Signori on the 13th of August 1365. A law was passed in 1366, soon after this proclamation, ordering every citizen to send a banner to Or. S. Michele and if he was a soldier, one light shield (“targa”). To this same end, governed by piety and following another law of 1386, the Churches’ Rectors and the Superiors of the Holiday of Ascension were expected to make an offering at the Altar, which on the same solemn day the Gonfalonier offered a gift of fruit at mid mass, serving as an example to all. Ever increasing the ardor of everyone to do new honors to Mary, he then gave votive offerings of wax figures portrayed naturally, being as tall as the living, with heads and hands, with hats, dresses, shapes, and every other ornament. As per the custom of those times, the Loggia was so filled that it was, as the proverb states, “Sarebbon’elleno mai tante quanti I Boti di Or. S. Michele” - There are more votives in Orsanmichele than there are Hellenes in Greece – to which S. Antonino add, “&amp; in processi temporis est repletes locus imaginibus cereis” (And as time went by, the room was filled with wax figures).</p>

<p>Returning to the holy laws of the republic regarding the veneration and esteem of this valuable image, we must not ignore the one which required the men of the government to swear on the venerable altar of Or. S. Michele to directly administer public matters and attest the books of Remembrances (Recordanze) of those times.</p>

<p>Each member made their public or private oaths solemnly, taking it for granted that severe punishments would be meted out to those with insincere intentions. An ancient statute can be found in Rubrica115 of book II which states that any oaths made beyond this altar would be declared null: Nullo modo valeat, neque observetur, nisi tale iuramentum praestitum fuerit coram B. Virgine, &amp; Capitaeneis Or. S. Michaelis (In no way shall it be valid, nor observed, unless such an oath has been made before the Blessed Virgin and the Captains of Ortus S. Michael). And from a book of the Company of Or. S. Michele we have the following privilege: “1329, the Florentine Republic orders that whoever has killed any of his relatives, from whom the delinquent could have inherited from, he shall be stripped of this inheritance. A third of this inheritance will then go to the company of the Virgin Mary of Or. S. Michele, and the remainder to the Municipality of Florence”. It was thought by the lords that the value of Or. S. Michele would increase by hosting exquisite concerts and a concourse for lauds which were said to be at the oratory every evening. The republic thus ordered in the law of 1388 that the musicians of the city, and the Sonatori di pifferi, and Viole players of the Palace, should come to Or. S. Michele on Saturdays and on solemn feasts, a custom which is still preserved today.</p>

<p>And here I may be granted, although outside its place, to discuss two additional alms made by the Company of Or. S. Michele which can give light to the Florentine history and which I did not know about when I wrote about the chapters of the company above. I learned about these from Mr. Domenic Maria Manni, who found them in the same books: “1306, alms of 100 florins donated by Giovanna Romita da Signa and delivered by Chele Lapi, a Laudese singer from San Frediano”. This is the same one from Signa who was beatified, and on page 49 of the book it says that the gift was for general maintenance or discretionary use. In the book of 1307, there is another alm from a resident of Fosse della Porta dell’Alloro Oste, Giotto di Bondone, the distinguished painter who restored the art to its glory.</p>

<p>And finally in praise of this Oratory, I will report some verses from the famous Fra Domenico from Coiella, a writer of the fifteenth century, no less famous for his theological works than for his poetic art, as noted by the scholarly author of the Delights of the Erudites in his tome of 1742, to whom we are able to give the print of the IV book of Elegies on Florentine churches to  the aforementioned Author, where he says as follows:</p>

<p>Attamen apparet longe spatiosior intus, 
Fulget ubi Sancta Matris imago Dei. 
Hans miro candore nitens complectitur arcus, 
Sculptilibus pollens undique marmoreis 
Quorum compages tanta contexitur arte, 
Ut fibi vix aliud par videatur opus</p>

<p>(However, the interior appears far more spacious; 
It shines when the image of the Holy Mother of God shines. 
Hans embraces a gleaming rainbow 
The powerful marble statues on all sides 
Their structure is so tightly consolidated 
Hardly another pair of work to be seen)</p>

<p>Second Lesson:</p>

<p>The motives of great patrons to construct magnificent buildings made is to demonstrate their might and wealth. At the same time it is the solicitous commitment to increase their city’s ornamentation and to contribute to the needs of its citizens. Such were the ends that the Florentine Republic had in mind when building the majestic and most splendid building of Or. S. Michele. It was the Florentines who had risen to great power by means of commerce and thus wanted to reveal to the whole world the splendor of their free state, and to give to its potentates a structure made even worthier by the many artistic riches installed inside it. One of the main ornaments of Florence,  this marvelous building had already been used for the preservation of grains and for the custody of the General Archive’s public faith. Nor should I overlook another nobler reason for its construction, derived from Florentine piety: the miraculous Tabernacle of the Madonna di Or. S. Michele. The Lords wanted the temple’s marvels of architecture and sculpture to complement each other, as we will see in this lesson. Since the original has been lost, I quote from an imperfect copy of the Captain’s Statutes that appears in Chapter X of the Green Book of Or. S. Michele, in which we read of the ordination made by the republic for the above-mentioned purpose:</p>

<p>“Templum in statura &amp; forma Palatii cum volta supra coopriente Oratorium, &amp; alia deinceps , &amp; tesso , atquesor platea, ubi consueverat esse sorum denominatum Orto di S. Michele, cui erant confines a 1 &amp; 2 via, a 3 Illorum de domo de Abbatibus, &amp; 4 de domo Caligariis, &amp; cuius constructio fuit commissa per Consilium Civitatis Arti Porta S. Maria, &amp; suit ordinatum, quod fierent 12. Pilastra laterum, &amp; in unoquoque ponendum fore statuam S. Advocati cuiusque Artis, &amp; in medio lateris dignioris Figura Advocati Partis Guelforum, cioe S. Ludovici, ut sic B. Virgo Maria defenderet &amp; augeret Artes &amp; Universitates buius Civitatis, ut apparet mentio de pradictis facts per Reformationem editam manu Ser Folchi Ser Antonii Notarii Populi &amp; Com. Flor an. 1309 De mense Aprilis.” Meaning:</p>

<p>The temple in stature and form of a palace with a vault above the oratory, and another successively, and tesso, and the street, where it had customarily been called Orto di S. Michele, whose first and second borders were on the road, the third side across from the house of their abbots, and the fourth from the house of the Caligaries. Its construction was entrusted by the Council of the Silk Guild, and it was arranged that twelve piers should hold the saintly advocates of the guilds, along with the patron saint of the Guelph party – S. Louis – so that B. Virgo Maria could defend and enhance the guilds and institutions of the State, as appears in the contract written by Ser Folchi Ser Antonio, Notary Public &amp; Com. Flor, in the year 1309, the month of April.</p>

<p>Therefore, we have from such an authoritative Book with the public Decree of the new construction delegated to the Silk guild, called the Por. S. Maria, for the fortunate and grandiose initiation of the foundation, or rather of the designs for, this building, in the year 1309. Taddeo Gaddi, the public’s architect of the time, had to do the design, but the pillars were not installed until 1337. The delay was caused by the Emperor Henry VII’s siege of Florence. He was the enemy of the Florentines his whole life since the war with the Pisans and Lucchesi and internal discord, but calm returned to the city on July 29 of the aforementioned year. The first stone was placed by Gonfaloniere Strozza, attended by the Signoria, and all the magistrates. Then followed all the people with the blessing of the Florentine Bishop Francesco Silvestri from Cingoli. Giovanni Villani spoke of this solemn function in book XI of his Chronicles, in chapter 66. To not repeat the things I said above, I will rather report some circumstance noted by Leopold del Migliore, on page 540, as follows: “The ceremony which was performed in the name of the Guelphs who dominated the city,  never reduced to such a happy state as it is now. It was marked by the throwing of gold and silver coins, minted on one side with the building and these letters: Ut magnificentia Pouli Flor Artis, &amp; Artificum ostendatur. On the other were the arms of the republic and we can read Reip. &amp; Popili Honor &amp; Decus” Those who were by chance there and told about it added more details, such as the fact that the Ambassador of the city of Arezzo threw a small coin onto the pile. How many years later the place reached its current state of sublime perfection is not possible to determine; although there are some paintings by Jacopo del Casentino, Lorenzo di Credi, and Andrea del Sarto, and Giovanni Antonio Sogliani. Luca della Robbia produced three of the tondi, and between them appear many statues that were produced in the fifteenth century by Donatello and his workshop that were done with innovation, noble design, and beauty. You many also wonder who the architect was, since in a folder in the church Leopold del Migliore praises Andrea Orcagna and Baldinucci gives credit to Taddeo Gaddi as the architect. However, I believe that they are correct in part, and we will see this once we distinguish the length of time it took to complete the project. First, in 1284, Arnolfo built the Loggia by order of the Signoria. Second, in 1337 Taddeo Gaddi installed the pillars which were first made of bricks, and then covered up with stone and marble. Gaddi then died in 1350. In 1352, according to Baldinucci, Orcagna worked on the altar of the Madonna until 1359, at which time he became the architect. As for the expense, Varchi writes that it reached eighty-six thousand gold florins, an enormous amount considering the currency’s value in those times.</p>

<p>Twenty thousand florins were diverted from the grain Loggia for the use of the church, as mentioned above. I found in the books of Commissions in the years 1339 and 1350, assigned to Silk Art, that this money was obtained without aggravating the municipality with a new tax, but that certain levies were created called the seven Piazzas from the Mallevadoria dell’Armi. Villani call it a small duty, as if by this diminutive term he meant how the little amount assigned to be collected was multiplied for the good of commerce that such an excellent amount could have been raised. However, I would like to recall an incredible entry which can be found in the book called Campione on page 14, and also noted by Villani in book XI, chapter 91. This entry notes that 750 florins of gold were obtained every year merely by sweeping up coins that were left there like trash. Still, we should note here the stupendous contributions made by devotees to the miraculous image, a portion of which was given to the magnificent ornamentation of this solemn and very rich temple.</p>

<p>This praise will truly prove to be appropriate for Or. S. Michele, and much greater still for what we will say to describe its qualities. Its shape is almost quadrangular, being 42 braccie long, 32 wide, and 80 tall. It is all encrusted with strong squared stone which is water resistant and season-proof.According to Vasari, all gothic style buildings made in Tuscany at the time were walled up, and this Barbarian Architectural can be seen in this tower. However, in it we see one of the first improvements of the art, which was done to reinvigorate it. We can observe the arches which are turned into a portion of a circle and above the main pillars of the vault there are two series of large adorned windows in the compartments formed by marble columns. In the triangles of the front we can see the coat of arms of the Republic, the Guelph Party, and the royal house of Naples which is a shield divided in half with lilies on one side, and flat listre on the other. This was done for the Kingdom of Hungary, which was under the rule of Louis Anjou, son of Charles, when the loggia was built. He was such a friend and protector of the Florentines and Guelphs that as a sign of gratitude they raised there his coat of arms. At the time, this was the greatest benevolence that Florence ever professed towards a monarch. The place was finished with a wreath of openwork roses, which was supported by corbels that swing outward and gracefully turn around you like a parapet. The ground runs around a stone foundation a little higher than four braccie up to the niches, in which appear statues of the patron saints of the guilds. Some of these larger than lifesize figures were made of metal and others of marble, but all were beautifully carved. They spared no expense to outdo the work of previous masters. A comment in a book marked “F” reads as follows: “Knowing how important it is to give heart to those who work hard to bring about ideas, try to leave his most honored name and fame to his homeland through rare workmanship. It is desired that those who have already been elected to show off their talent, and to know about the Statues of Or. S. Michele, be amply rewarded.”</p>

<p>To give an account of these statues starting from the eastern side to the via dei Calzaioli, in the first niche there was St. Luke, then St. Thomas, followed by St. John the Baptist. Towards the middle, the first niche holds St. John the Evangelist, St. George is in the second, St. James is in the third, and St. Mark the fourth. On the side of the magistrate, St. Lo was on the first pillar, then St. Stephen and third St. Matthew. Turning to Tramontana, the first niche is vacant for a certain reason of which we speak later; the second spot contains the Quattro Coronati, followed by St. Philip and then St. Peter.</p>

<p>Coming back to St. Luke, this statue was made by Giambologna for the guild of the Judges and Notaries, also known as the Proconsolo, whose coat of arms is a star of gold, which fills the whole field with silver carved in the corners of the base. St. Thomas was made by Andrea del Verrocchio, disciple of Donatello. The saint seems so alive that it appears to be led by love to touch the wound of Christ. It was done at the expense of Mercanzia, which has a red star on a white bale as an insignia. By virtue of a public decree, St. Louis should be placed in this niche but we do not know why he was withdrawn from the niche save for matters of style. I read in the Green Champion, ordered in 1483, that Andrea was satisfied with this workmanship and placed its value at up to 800 large florins.</p>

<p>St. John the Baptist belongs to the Merchants’ Guild, formerly the Consuls of the Calimala, whose symbol is a golden eagle on a white bale in a red field. The workmanship is by Ghiberti, whose name is written to the hem of the suit. However, we must confess that this is a languid figure in comparison to his other marvelous works. St. John the Evangelist, made of bronze, is the work of Baccio da Montelupo who made it with great diligence for the Silk guild, for whom the symbol is a red door on a silver field. Next is St. George, whose first location was in Tramontana, very proportionate to his greatness. We will later talk about the reason for his moving.  The armorers and swordsmen, who make metal jackets and rapiers for weapons, had it done. This figure is esteemed by all as the most beautiful. In addition to what Vasari says about it, Bocchi has made a treatise titled “The Excellence of the Statue of St. Giorgio made by Donatello,” which was printed in 1584 by Marescotti. Nearby is the statue of St. James of the guild of the Furriers, who have on their coat of arms a white sheep on a field of blue. This saint was done by Nanni di Antonio del Bianco and is very much liked. St. Mark is by Donatello, of which Michelangelo said:</p>

<p>“That if such was the semblant of the living Saint, he could be believed in everything he has written, as much shows the statue of an honest man. Nanni made St. Louis for the Farrier’s guild, as evidenced by their coat of arms, which is a pair of black pincers. Admirable is the St. Stephen, a worthy work of Ghiberti, as a reward of which he also had the grace to make St. Matthew which is for the Wool Guild, having a white sheep with a white banderola and a red cross on a blue field as the coat of arms; there is also that of the Bankers guild, whose symbol was a red field sown with gold coins. In the archive of said guild there is a book in which, in addition to reading the allocation of the statue to Ghiberti, you can find how the officers of the guild obtained the niche, which had previously been given to the guild of the bakers to place their protector, St. Lawrence. However, being that the statue was poor valueless art, on the 24th of June in 1419 the Signoria, led by Gonfaloniere Niccolò di Franco Sacchetti – with the consent of the bakers – gave their place to the bankers to make the figure of St. Matthew, for which Lorenzo Ghiberti received 650 gold florins. Two marble statuettes, worked with honor by Niccolò Aretino, can also be observed in this place. After this comes the empty niche, where nothing remains except a base with a prodigious half-relief by Donatello representing St. George who kills the Dragon, praised by Raffaello Borghini with these words “one can look at it, but not imitate it.” The Quattro Coronati are by Nanni, representing four different Masters of the arts with the ax, the shoe, the ladle, and other blacksmith tools. The artist was troubled with their positioning in such a narrow place. However, his master Donatello, with the reward of only a dinner, with a few industrious blows, arranged them in a way to cover the disciple’s error, which got him esteem and wonder from all. Next is St. Philip, made by Nanni for the guild of the shoemakers. St. Peter was for the Guild of the Butchers, intelligently made by Donatello. Vasari holds it to be an admirable and extremely rare work due to the graceful drapery corresponding to the altitude of the body, so that the clothes are not better worn on a living man.</p>

<p>Such a litany of statues, united this way and exhibited to the public, is seen in very few cities. Many have come from distant places to see them, confessing that it seems to them a rare thing indeed. To defend these statues and uphold the respect demanded by the Florentines, we have the statute which imposes punishment on anyone who throws stones at them or does some harm to them. We can find another beautiful view in the archways between pillars, adorned with four tall columns, on each of which is a statue one and a half braccie tall. In all they are forty, decorated with rustic acanthus leaves, as the arabesques that fill the arches are very vague. The last things to be seen above the niches are paintings in the twelve terracotta tondi, all but three of which are ruined, by Luca della Robbia. They depict a Madonna with a child on her neck above the pillar of St. George, the army of the Republic above St. Thomas, and the symbol of the guild of Por Santa Maria above St. John. Now it remains to discuss the aforementioned translation of the Madonna from the guild of the Doctors and Apothecaries that one can now see at S. Giorgio. However, having to assemble in another lesson on the many shining virtues from the interior of the Temple, in which we will talk again about the story of this decorative program, we will here return to  praise this wonderful construction, some verses from the famous Dominican poet:</p>

<p>“Nunc ubi magna domus pracelsa turris ad instar Fertur in aereas altius una plagas • 
Qua licet ex omni videatur splendida parte Sanctorum Statuas dum soris ipsa tenet. Attamen apparet longe speciosor intus Fulget ubi Sancta Matris Imago Dei.” Meaning:</p>

<p>Now where the great house towers, said to be in bronze, one of the higher quarters 
From which one may be seen on every side the splendid statues of the saints while she holds the statues of sori. However, it appears far more beautiful inside where the image of the Holy Mother of God shines.</p>

<p>Third Lesson:</p>

<p>It is impossible to discuss the church interior in an orderly manner without considering the prodigious altar of the Madonna of Or. S. Michele, already described in the first lesson. I must add to the aforementioned discussion a comment on the laudable uses made from the great riches it has generated for the republic, and the daily sacred rites the altar services. To start with the first one, I will note a document indicating the great treasures spent in pious works by the superiors of the Oratory. Thanks to the captains, in addition to the splendid and noble maintenance of the church, they were able to administer large sums of money for the workings of the Monasteries of Chiarito, Lapo, and San Giorgio. Today they are considered exemplary monasteries in Florence, and their establishment is noted in the writings of Ser Michele di Ghirolfo da Lucardo in 1342 and Ser Salvestro Salvestri in 1405 in the general archive. About the second point, I would like to refer to the institution formed by the republic in 1415, composed of a collegiate of ten Priests and two cherici with a head called “Proposto” (Superintendent). Its establishment can be found a book with wooden covers in the archives of the captains. It can be read there that up until that time, the Oratory had been used by a single priest with the title of Sacristan. With the intervention of the musicians, they assist with the performance of the usual lauds to Mary on the holidays, and on every Saturday at the unveiling of the sacred Image with the singing of the litany, at which time 26 candles burn, with 12 at the altar, 6 at the tendrils, and eight at the garland. By legacy of Luca di Filippo Carnesecchi Gentiluomo Fiorentino, two candles must always be lit for the Mass at the Consecration. In his Testament of 1601, drawn up by Ser Antonio di Ser Chello, he says “I leave two doublets of yellow wax of 15 pounds to be perpetually lit to the Madonna of Or S. Michele at the time of the elevation of the host.”</p>

<p>Passing now to recall how many sacred and beautiful things were in this Oratory, I will say that leaning against the pillar, next to this chapel, there is a larger than life-size wood crucifix, carved in a primitive style that the Florentines venerate. Based on the authority of the writers of Holy Archbishop Antoninus’s life, it was believed that it was customary for him to go there to pray when he was a child; so he was painted at the foot of the cross, at that age. However, we can’t confirm without an authoritative document whether the Crucifix of dried Elm actually spoke to the Saint (Antoninus). However, I believe Rondinelli’s report of the plague, in which he wrote: “The Friars of St. Mark went in procession on many Fridays to the Crucifix of Or. S. Michele to which St. Antonino went to pray as a boy.” I must thank those Benefactors, who in the year 1714 made for this divine image a richly carved tabernacle with a gilded canopy, pavonazzi pendants, and gold fringes. Opposite in the second pillar, you can see a fresco figure of The Good Thief, which was rarely painted in those days: the painter not only nailed him to the cross, but tied his legs with ropes so that he would not be confused with Christ Jesus. This is the customary way the Church made it, as Molano noted.</p>

<p>I will now talk about the reason this painting was placed here. For 300 years the painting was noted in the Books of the Compagnia della Croce al Tempio, and copied by Vincenzio del Corno Gentiluomo Fiorentino – lover of old things - in his memoirs, and read about in Leopoldo del Migliore’s book as follows “1361 N. N. condemned to the gallows, he was from a family more than moderately civil. A few hours before he was taken to the fields, he spoke to a brother of the company of the Neri who was used to assisting those about to suffer publicly. He told him he had a sum of money in a chest at his house at the foot of the Ponte Vecchio. His intention was to have a figure of the Good Thief painted in Or. S. Michele at the pillar near the oratory so that one could pray to God that in that last short breath, so that he would use the mercy to bless him. Whoever fulfilled this legacy wrote this memoir.” This image was painted by Iacopo Landini from Prato Vecchio, known as the Casentino (Jacopo del Casentino). We will now mention about the other paintings in that space, almost all of which were his.</p>

<p>The vault indeed is by Jacopo, where he represented sixteen Patriarchs and Prophets who pose on a field of ultramarine blue, a color that cost a lot since it has to be extracted from the precious lapis lazuli stones. There were many state citizens who murmured about it saying it was a waste of the Madonna of Orsanmichele’s money. However, this bold talk displeased the people so much that, according to Cambi, they wanted the imprisonment of one member of the Foraboschi house to satisfy the outrage of Mary. Returning to Jacopo del Casentino, likewise he painted the many saints that appear above the other in the arches. On a second ovate St. Mary Magdalene is carried to heaven by the angels, the latter painted by the hand of Andrea del Sarto. St. Stephen, painted between the two doors, was made by Poppi, who again made the two paintings, that are in the choir, of Christ and St. John the Baptist. The St. Martin in front of St. Stephen is believed to be of the Sogliani. The St. Augustine in the middle of the choir is also believed to be his although there are those who say it was done by Albertinelli. On the wall under the organ, Agnolo Gaddi represented Christ Disputing among the Doctors. And let’s not neglect to report what Doctor Brocchi recalls having happened to the figure of St. Verdiana, who is seen at the pillar of the corner of this church next to the image of St. Lucy. This image particularly flourished in our times, but to the great detriment of history the painter erased the inscription written in gothic characters underneath. Stranger still, the Saint can now be seen in secular clothing, whereas normally she was shown wearing a religious habit.</p>

<p>The important chapel of St. Anne was erected by of the Municipality of Tramontana, which was dedicated to commemorate the most important action that could happen in a free republic, the expulsion of the Tyrant Duke of Athens and violent occupier of the Florentine Domain. This occurred on July 26, 1343 the feast of St. Anne’s, who became honored for her assistance as one of the patron saints of the city, receiving the title Propitia &amp; F. utrix libertatis Civitatis Florentina, “the woman of liberty of the state of Florence.” In the Book of Riformagioni Lib. B. of 1349, appears a record of how the Signoria decreed to spend three thousand florins of gold for the erection of a new chapel in Or. S. Michele. This chapel was then demolished in 1526 by the captains so that the altar could receive on top of it the larger-than-life white marble figure of the Virgin Mary Carrying the Infant Jesus in her womb, a highly praised work by Francesco da San Gallo. On the 26th of July, the Signoria annually took part in a ritual offering with the Captains of the guilds. There was on that day a horse race, among other things of great joy, ordered in the Statutes of the 28 of October 1343 with this beautiful introduction of words:</p>

<p>“Pro honore Reip. &amp; ad perpetuam memomoriam libertatis Civitatis Florentia, &amp; ut Civium mentibus sit infixum, qualiter die S. Anna de mense Iulii Populus Flor per Dei gratiam, &amp; virtutem bonorum, a Tyrannide Ducis Atbernarum liberatus.” Meaning:</p>

<p>“In honor of the Commonwealth and to the perpetual remembrance of the liberty of the state of Florence, and so that it may be fixed in the minds of the citizens, how on the day of St. Anna, in the month of July, the people of Flor, by the grace of God and the virtue of good men, were freed from the tyranny of the duke of Athens.”</p>

<p>And in a panel of the church we read that on this feast day is exhibited the relic of the saint, which is kissed by the Friars of the Centuria and the Nuns of SS. Trinità.</p>

<p>I will now speak about another chapel and refer back to what I promised in the preceding lesson. A Madonna seated with her son made by Simone da Fiesole, pupil of Brunelleschi, was placed at the niche of the Apothecaries. It was then transferred to the church where it was placed at one of the two large doors to form a chapel. The reason for this was that in 1628, many people swore to have seen this statue blink and move, which then caused a panic. They all ran away in very large numbers, forming crowds during the day and night to the point that the streets had to be blocked to escape the tumult. Everyone was shouting for mercy, which was one of the preludes to the plague which came to Florence in 1630. To divert the devout people, who refused leave there, Grand Duke Ferdinand resolved to transfer it inside. This miraculous event was processed by the order of Archbishop Alessandro Marzimedici and the Canon Cavaliere Giovanni Guidacci, one of the people who claimed to have seen the statue blink several times. During the time of the Republic, another similar case occurred (in 1493) with the image of the Madonna, which was standing outside of its niche. In this case an uncoverted Jew, on a fine day when he thought he couldn’t be seen, struck the statue with an iron rood, a crime for which he was killed. This incident can be read today at the foot of the marble, and the sacrilege also appears in the Chronicle by Forese da Ribatta, who goes into more detail saying that his body was thrown into St. Stephen’s sewer as a final contempt.</p>

<p>The words carved into the marble base in the memory of this fact are the following:</p>

<p>“Hanc ferro effigiem petiit ludeus, &amp; Index 
Ipse fibi vulgo dilaniatus obit MccccLxxXXlII.”</p>

<p>Knowing that the title of Or. S. Michele is frequently mentioned in these lessons, I will now report the origin of its name as it contains significant information about antiquity which I do know if historians truly speak about. I begin by examining the doubt that there was already an Oratory there since 750, dedicated to the Holy Arcangel. To be safe with the authoritative documents, I will first say that shortly after the year 1000 there was a Parish Church with a contiguous garden that was called San Michele in Orto(garden). It was situated in the most dignified place in the city and was truly more venerable than any other which was in Florence. The fact that it was a Parish is very clear from the very ancient sources, which declare it as such in a testament in the Badia Archive number 25 among the following witnesses: Filippus Pieri Ranerii, S. Micaelis in orto 1100.  In many ancient contracts of the Mozzi family, who lived along the route that passes by S. Gregorio to the Arno River, the parish of San Michele in Orto is mentioned. It later passed to the Cistercian monks of the abbey of S. Silvestro di Nonatola, but I have not been able to find a source for this. The truth is that Pope Innocentius III, in one of his notes from Viterbo in 1209, confirms to said Monks that this church was still of S. Michele: Ecclesias S. Felicis, S. Martini in Mamma, &amp; S. Michaelis intus Flor. Afterwards, when the Republic had to reassume its patronage and claimed its ancient rights, it had to displace the Cistercians,  which was met with some disgust from Rome which can be found in the Reformations in a letter from Papa Inocenzio IV dating back to 1249. In it, the republic was urged to return the church to the abbey of Nonantola, together with the castle of S. Martino. The effects of this exhortation can be seen in the resolutions of the republic. Since the Signoria needed a piazza for the sale of grain and large rooms to store it, they had the church leveled, as it was considered a very opportune location. A Loggia was then to be built, of which the Migliore says the following on page 530: “With the design of Arnolfo Panno 1284 which was founded on the ancient church of S. Michele.” To not lose the memory of such an ancient church, the Republic wanted Arnolfo to build another one in front of the new Loggia at the same time. This is the present oratory, called S. Michele Vecchio but today called S. Carlo. The reason for this is that S. Carlo da Paolo (Borromeo) had recently been canonized and the fame of his holiness penetrated everywhere. The main cities, especially Florence, were filled with devotion to the saint. After remembering about the ancient passage from Florence to Milan, made by the Borromeans, and of the space made for the saint, he ordered some relics to be brought from Milan to Florence. The first of these relics was a large piece of the shirt he was wearing when he died and a sponge which had been used to collect his blood. The solemnity in receiving them was very great due to the devotion among the people. However, Cosimo II foresaw that the place where these relics were to be placed was very narrow to celebrate the sacred translation. Wanting to give a sign of his usual devotion and grateful to show himself courteous to the offers from the Cardinal, he signed a memorial to the Company of the Lombards, to whom they were to direct the relics.</p>

<p>This granted the brothers the oratory of San Michele as a more capable place than the church of S. Miniato, where the company gathered having already moved from S. Pier del Murrone, today called S. Giovannino in Via di S. Gallo. Furthermore, his highness wanted the captains of Or. S. Michele who had the dominion of the oratory to donate it by decree of 1616, on the condition that no coat of arms would ever be placed on it (arme). Then, the very ancient painting depicting a dead Christ was removed from the high altar and was transferred to the door inside. It was replaced afterwards by Matteo Roselli’s painting, in which S. Carlo was dressed as a cardinal – a glorious, shiny, and resplendent figure surrounded by angels. Among them, in the first place was S. Michele with his insignia. However, the captains foresaw that the new veneration to S. Carlo would make us forget the Oratory of S. Michele, which was illustrated by Pope Alexander VII in the ninth year of his pontificate of a perpetual indulgence for the Brothers on the Feast of St. Charles. The grandstand of the altar had been erected in ancient times by the Pilli Consular Family, of which Dante speaks in Canto XVI of Paradiso: Great was the column of the Vajo. In the scriptures of Or. S. Michele we read “High altar of the Oratory of S. Michele made in the execution of the testament of Messer Bindo dei Pilli in the year 1376”. On the left, as you enter, you can see a panel by Fabbrizio Boschi who portrayed the presentation of Christ in the temple with a beautiful design and a vivacity of colors.</p>

<p>As a sign of the patronage of the captains, their unifom is carved in gilded bronze characters which are the three letters: O.S.M.</p>

<p>Finally I return to the loggia of Or. S. Michele, which was said to have been a tower for grain storage supported by 16 pillars. It was subsequently judged by the Grand Duke Cosimo I to be a suitable place to store and preserve documents and historical writings from fire and water. A medal was made with the effigy of the Grand Duke and his name on one side, and on the reverse was the open door of the archives, with many illustrated books for protocols with crowns on the title page and letters around it which said: Publica Fidei.</p>

<p>There is still an inscription on the door of the archives located in the via Calimala in gold lettering and it says: “ARCHIVIVM HOC PERPETVITATI PVBLICORVM MONIMENTORVM CONSERVANDAE DICATVM SERENISS COSMVS MED. EREXIT . QVAMPRIMVM MAGNVS DVX HETRVRIAE SALVTATVS REGIAQVE corona insignitvs est mdlxix.”</p>

<p>I thought I had finished my historical memoirs about Or. S. Michele, however, I should speak of an indispensable piece of information without which the reader would misunderstand the officials of Or. San. Michele. Two magistrates had similar appelations. The first was responsible for the care of the Piazza or Loggia, regarding the sale of wheat and fodder.</p>

<p>The second magistrate was in charge of the good governance of the company and Oratory of the Madonna of Or. S. Michele, along with extensive jurisdiction over the goods donated to the Holy Image. This difference between these two positions appears in the Carnera Fiscale in the book marked 1344, which contains various decrees and writings of the Priori at the Podestà of Florence. Under the date February 27, the following excerpts about grain officials can be found: Filippus Rochi de Capponibus, Zenobius Lapi Risaliti, Dominicus Rizzini Fagioli, &amp; Mattheus Roselli Pictor Officiales extracti pro Comuni Flor. ad Officium Platea O. Si M. pro termino, &amp; tempore quatuor mensium. With this document, I regret to have to note the mistake of Leopoldo del Migliore on page 369 of his Illustrated Florence. Leopoldo stated that the aformentioned Matteo da Rosello was one of the captains of the Madonna of Or. S. Michele even though his name was never mentioned by other scholars. However, if he is not among the captains of the Madonna, he deserved to be placed by Giorgio Vasari among the painters as determined in the above-mentioned election. Among his works is the painting of Hell, which he completed in Or. S. Michele. Going back to Leopoldo’s Illustrated Florence, on the same page we can find the following words: “Painted naturally in that hell were many sad men of that age, among which were the Duke of Athens with his followers, since they were traitors of the lordship of Florence. They had shown themselves contrary to the public interest as they went against freedom and were thieves with evil tongues. The resemblances in the painting were so excellent that those who had known them were able to point them out in the painting. For as long as the painting stood, the following proverb was said in Florence: “He is portrayed in S. Michele and that is enough. This work was done by Matteo di Rossello, an ancient and civil painter.”
  Returning to the Captains, I must add that these positions were abolished by our Emperor who gave the supervision of the sacred temple to a single gentleman, who is currently Mr. Domenico Baldigiani. I will recall here the twentieth congregation of priests, known as the visitation which recognized its beginning on February 24, 1494. This congregation was composed of exactly 40 priests and they gathered in the church of S. Michele in Palchetto, where the following title can be read on the door:</p>

<p>“CONGREGATIO VISITATIONIS PRESBYTERORVM.” Meaning, “Association for the Visitation of Priests.”</p>

<p>Lezione Prima:</p>

<p>Molte, e molte sono in Firenze le 
miracolose Immagini di Maria, 
tra le quali la più gloriosa andò 
mai sempre quella di Or S. Michele o si voglia per la moltiplicità dei secoli, o per la quantità 
dei miracoli, o per la qualità 
degli onori; i quali tre privilegi 
mi piace di far vedere in questa 
Lezione. Ma prima dir si vuole del suo sovrano Tabernacolo nella vaghezza del disegno, e nella ricchezza dei marmi sorpassante ogni umana estimazione: movendomi a ciò fare la mancanza di molte pregevoli notizie tralasciate da Francesco Bocchi, da 
Giovanni Cinelli, e da Filippo Baldinucci, i quali scrissero di quest’Oratorio; e più assai ne poteva scrivere 
Giorgio Vasari nella vita di Andrea Orcagna ; tutta volta 
ToM’ I. Fart’ L A</p>

<p>Tuttavolta principierò dal riportare quello, che sommariamente egli scrisse come appresso “Poco poi avendo gli Uomini della Compagnia di Or S. Michele messi insieme molti denari di limosine, e beni stati donati a quella Madonna per la mortalità del 1348. Risolverono volerle fare intorno una Cappella, ovvero Tabernacolo non solo di marmi in tutti i modi intagliati , e di altre pietre di pregio ornatissimo, e ricco, ma di mosaico ancora , e di ornamenti di bronzo, quanto più desiderare si potesse , in tanto che per opera, e per materia avanzasse ogni altro lavoro infino a quel dì per tanta grandezza stato fabbricato ; perciò dato carico di tutto all’Orcagna, come al più eccellente di quell’età, egli fece tanti disegni, che finalmente uno ne piacque a chi governava, come migliore di tutti gli altri; onde allogato il lavoro a lui, si rimisero in tutto al giudizio , e consiglio suo, perchè egli dato a diversi maestri d’intaglio avuti di più paesi, a fare tutte le altre cose, attese con il suo fratello a condurre tutte le Figure dell’opera , e finito il tutto le fece murare, e commettere insieme molto consideratamente senza calcina con ispranghe di rame impiombate, acciocché i marmi lustrati, e puliti non si macchiassero, la qual cosa gli riuscì tanto bene con utile, ed onore di quelli, che sono stati dopo di lui , che a chi considera quell’opera, pare mediante tale unione, e commettiture trovate dall’Orcagna, che tutta la Cappella sia cavata di un pezzo di marmo solo . E ancorché ella sia di maniera Tedesca, in quel genere ha tanta grazia, e proporzione, ch’ ella tiene il primo luogo fra le cose di quei tempi, essendo massimamente ii suo componimento di Figure grandi e piccole, e di Angeli, e di Profeti di mezzo rilievo intorno alla Madonna benissimo condotti. E’ maraviglioso ancora il getto dei recingimenti di bronzo diligentemente puliti, che girando intorno a tutta l’opera la racchiuggono, e serrano insieme di maniera che essa ne rimane non meno gagliarda, e forte, che in tutte le altre parti bellissima.”</p>

<p>“Ma quanto egli si affaticasse per mostrare in quella età grossa la sottigliezza del suo ingegno, si vede in una Storia grande di mezzo rilievo nella parte di dietro di detto Tabernacolo, dove in fìgure di un braccio, e mezzo l’una fece i dodici Apostoli, che in alto guardano la Madonna, mentre in una mandorla circondata di Angioli saglie al Cielo, in uno dei quali Apostoli ritrasse se stesso vecchio, com’era, con la barba rasa col cappuccio avvolto al capo, e col viso piatto, tondo. Oltre a ciò scrisse a basso nel marmo queste parole: Andreas Cionis Pictor Florentinus Oratorii Archimagister exstitit bujus 1359.” Sin qui il Vasari nulla dicendo della varietà dei preziosi marmi, e rarissime pietre, nulla delle tante belle fìgure, e statue, e nulla de misteri effigiati nei bassi rilievi; anzi egli accennando quello della SS. Vergine Assunta prende uno sbaglio, ove dice, che gli Apostoli guardano la Madonna salita in Cielo, conciossiacosaché non uno, ma due sono 
i bassi rilievi qui divisi in due quadri, nel primo dei quali in alto evvi la Vergine Assunta circondata dagli Angioli con appiè della Tavoia alcuni alberi lavorati con rara finezza, e nel secondo spartimento da basso , che nulla ha che fare coll’altro divisato, vedesi la Madonna morta attorniata dagli Apostoli, tra’quali, egli è vero , che l’Orcagna ritrasse se stesso, ma non già vecchio , come il suddetto Scrittore disse, avvegnachè il bravo Artefice morisse nel 1389. di anni 60. e però nel 1359. nel quale finì il Tabernacolo, doveva avere anni 30. senza più.</p>

<p>E principiando quì a supplire nelle cose, che sì desiderano negli Scrittori di questa Cappella , notar mi piace in primo luogo, come un bellissimo disegno di quest’Opera con sue misure fatto di propria mano dell’Orcagna vedesì al presente, dopo un corso di anni 400. benissimo conservato nell’ insigne Libreria degli antichi manoscritti, e spogli del già Senatore Carlo Strozzi , e noi mercè la cortesia del Signor Carlo Tommaso suo 
degno Nipote ne diamo in rame la figura. Or venendo alla esatta descrizione, nell’angolo della Loggia verso il mezzo di (Continua alla seguente pagina)</p>

<p>Mezzo di il mio Leggitore incontrerà una platea ornata di vari marmi, alta quanto uno scalino, e larga tre braccia, la quale ricorre intorno al Tabernacolo coperto da una tribuna a cupola, e circondato di ricca balaustrata, posando su d’una scalinata pure di marmo. Nei quattro angoli del cancello lavorato con arabeschi di bronzo veggonsi quattro piedistalli, che sostengono una colonna spirale, sul di cui capitello evvi una statua rappresentante un Angioìo: queste colonne sono alte braccia quattro, e tre quarti, e gli Angioli braccia uno, e un quarto. Dentro poi a questa nobile balaustrata si innalza il tanto commendato Tabernacolo retto da quattro pilastri, ciascuno dei quali ha nove colonne alte braccia tre, e un sesto, e grosse un quarto, tra l’una, e l’altra di esse veggendosi pietre dure rilucenti con abbondevolezza di lapislazzuli non solamente nei pilastri, ma nelle basi, e negli archi della Cupola. Dodici sono i Profeti, quali alti un braccio, e mezzo girano sull’architrave, avendo ciascuno un cartello in mano esprimente le virtù di Maria Vergine, e sonovi quattro guglie lavorate alla Gottica alte braccia sei, e un ottavo senza la base, le quali mettono in mezzo la Cupola alta braccia sei, e un quarto, e nel più alto di esta un Angiolo alto braccia due. Nè dall’occhio fuggire ci debbono i vaghi arabeschi, e fogliami finissimi di marmo sparsi da per tutto in sì fatta guisa, che miracolosi piuttosto che rari sono riputati ; e per fine nell’imbasamento della Tribuna in bassi rilievi graziosissimi otto misteri si rappresentano, e sono la Natività di Maria, la sua Presentazione al Tempio, lo Sposalizio con San Giuseppe, la Nunziata , la Nascita di Cristo, l’Epifania , la Circoncisione , e nell’ottavo, giusta l’antica tradizione, l’Artefice effigiò un Angelo, che porta alla Vergine una palma quale annunzio di sua vicina morte.</p>

<p>Nel mezzo adunque di così ragguardevole Tribuna sopra un ricco altare circondata da bellissimi Angioli di rilievo adorasi la Tavola tanto famosa nei Mondo tutto dell’Immagine di Maria Vergine, detta la Madonna.</p>

<p>Madonna di Or S. Michele potentissima Avvocata dei Fiorentini. Ma perché moderno Autore Toscano per altro letterato, qual si fu Giulio Mancini ,in un suo discorso di pittura, che lasciò scritto a penna, nega , che questa Immagine fosse dipinta da Ugolino Sanese , io riporterò quì la dotta difesa dal Baldinucci scritta nella vita dell’Orcagana, come segue : “Soggiungeremo per ultimo, che lo Scrittor moderno, di cui parlammo pur dianzi, ha creduto equivoco del Vasari, l’aver affermato, che la sacra Immagine di Maria Vergine ornata da questo Tabernacolo fosse fatta per mano di Ugolino morto nel 1349. ed essendo l’immagine stata dipinta nel 1284. Non gli pareva verisimile, che in quel tempo, cioè del 1284. Ugolino avesse potuto essere ben istruito in pittura, che potesse avere una tal’opera dipinta, e che la maniera si avvicinava più alla Greca, che a quella, che allora usavasi in Firenze; e finalmente che l’Immagine è sopra a legno, e Vasari dice, che fosse fatta da Ugolino nel pilastro.  Ma se bene si considera, non avrà più luogo il dubbio del soprannominato Autore, prima perchè il Vasari nella sua prima edizione dice, 
che Ugolino morì non già nel 1349 ma nel 1339 e tanto nella prima, che nella seconda edizione afferma, che Ugoiino morisse in età decrepita; sicché fatto bene il conto, egli nel 1284. potè essere in età di 30 o di 35 anni almeno, e conseguentemente nel più bello del suo operare. Secondariamente dice il Vasari nella prima edizione, e nella seconda ancora a lettere apertissime, che Ugolino operò di maniera Greca, anzi, che tale antica maniera volle egli sempre ostinatamente tenere, non ostante che da molti Pittori del suo tempo, e dallo stesso Giotto sì operasse di assai miglior maniera : sicchè per questo stesso dobbiamo dire, che la pittura è mano di Ugolino . Che poi ella sìa sopra legno, o sopra muro, forse può essere, che lo Stampatore delle opere di Vasari in luogo di dire: fece l’Immagine di nostra Donna per un pilastro della Loggia ec. dicesse: in un pilastro e quando anche cosi aves.</p>

<p>E quando anche cosi avesse detto il Vasari troviamo ancora, che il medesimo, e con Iui molti di coloro, che hanno scritte vite dei Pittori, hanno usato dire, fece una tavola nella tal Chiesa, e non per questo s’intende che quella tavola fosse fatta in quella Chiesa , ma per quella Chiesa, non nella tal Cappella , ma per queìla Cappella, cioè che dovea andare in quella Chiesa, o Cappella. Così l’aver detto il Vasari, Ugolino fece la Nostra Donna nel pilastro, non ci toglie il poter credere, che egli volesse dire, che Ugolino avesse sopra tavola fatta l’immagine per rapportarsi, e sìtuarsi poi nel pilastro, onde il dubbio par che si riduca ad una mera cavillazione.”</p>

<p>E così compiuto avendo all’obbligo di rintracciare tutte le più notevoli cose di questa Cappella, passerò io a ragionare dei privilegi singolari della Santissima Immagine. E facendomi dalla moitiplicità degli anni, ne quali ella è a Fiorentini in venerazione osservare debbo, che l’anno 1292 benchè sia il tempo notato da Giovanni Villani, e dagli Scrittori, nel quale strepitosi erano i miracoli , non è però l’epoca giusta, avvegnachè io trovo la insigne Compagnia della Madonna di Or. S. Michele principiata nel 1291 il qual anno necessariamente suppone, che prima di qualche tempo fosse già in grande venerazione nel pilastro la miracolosa Tavola , onde sembra, che si possa stabilire , che dopo al 1284 nel qual anno fu fabbricata la loggia, ivi venisse collocata la santissima Tavola. Onde sarebbero già anni 460 e più, contando solamente dal 1291 principio dalla Compagnia. E piacemiquì fare non dispregevole riflessione sopra una maravigliosa combinazione di due Santuari nello stesso tempo principiati, e diventati famosi in tutto il Mondo: imperciocchè in questo tempo appunto, quando II Cielo aprì in Firenze nella nostra Immagine un fonte, o piuttosto un fiume di grazie, gli Angioli portarono la Casa di Nazaret dalla Palestina nell’Italia. E se Pontefici Imperatori, Re, e Principi rendettero magnifico ii Tempio Lauretano, la sola Repubblica Fiorentina, come poscia vedremo, non guardando a spendere immensi tesori, fabbricò alla Madonna di Or S. Michele una delle più splendide, e superbe Chiese, come parlano i libri delle Riformagioni “Un fiat Beatissime Virgini Marie S. Michaelis in Orto templum splendidissimum, &amp; supra modum splendidissimum. E se alla S. Casa di Loreto da tutte le parti del Mondo divoti Pellegrini si portano, anche da diverse parti dell’Europa venivano i Popoli con larghissìme offerte, e voti a venerare la nostra Immagine, cosi scrivendo la Signoria a Papa Urbano V. nel 1364. Ad quod sere concurrunt homines de variis Mundi partibus.</p>

<p>E dopo sì bella digressione tornando alia nostra Immagine, non debbo tralasciar di dire alcunché della Compagnia di Or S. Micheie, come il più autorevole documento dimostrante l’antichità delia miracolosa Tavola: nè meglio io saprei farlo, che riportando sommariamente i Capitoli antichi della medesima Compagnia scritti di carattere del XIV. secolo, e comunicatimi dall’erudito, e cortese Sig. Domenico Maria Manni, il prologo dei quali è come segue “In nome del Padre, del Figliolo, e dello Spirito Santo. Amen. Ad honore, &amp; reverentia del Nostro Signore Gesù Christo, e de la sua Santissima Madre Madonna Santa Maria sempre Vergine, e del Beato Messer Santo Michele Arcangelo, &amp; del Beato Messer Santo Lorenzo, e di tutta la Corte di Paradiso , e ad honore , e reverentia de la Santa Chiesa di Roma , &amp; del Nostro Signore Messer lo Papa, e dei suoi Frati Segnori Cardinali, e di Messer lo Vescovo di Firenze, e ad stato, e honore, e mantenimento de la Città di Firenze, e del suo distretto, ad bene e consolatione dei Poveri. Questi sono i Capitoli, e gli ordini di quelli, che sono, e saranno de la detta Compagnia, la quale fu cominciata negli anni de la Incarnatione del Nostro Segnore Iesu Christo, MccLxxxxi. il dì di Beato Messer Santo Lorenzo del mese di Agosto.”</p>

<p>Quaranta sono i capitoli, quali io comprendo in tre soli più che sufficienti, onde viemaggiormente corroborare l’alta venerazione dei popoli a quest’immagine. E nel primo rammentare si deve la maniera, che tenevasi per consolare l’immenso popolo, che in folla chiedeva 
di essere ascritto alla Compagnia, la quale teneva stipendiato un Notaio obbligato in tutti i giorni feriali, e solenni di stare a desco a registrare i nomi dei fratelli, e delle sorelle, che vi si ascrivevano, e perché uno non reggeva al concorso dei devoti, si prese l’espediente, che gli stranieri, e quelli del Contado si facessero scrivere nel popolo, del quale era la Porta, onde essi entravano in Città, e con raro esempio trovasi nel capitolo XXXVII che si ascrivevano alla Compagnia anche i morti, sol che uno ne portasse al Notaio il nome del defunto , quale scritto nel libro, si faceva l’anima sua partecipe dei suffragi; della qual grazia se ne dava la poliza segnata col suggello della Compagnia avente per impronta la Nunziata, ed intorno scritte queste lettere: Sigillum Societatis Virg. Marie Sancti Mich. in orto de Florentia. Al secondo capitolo ristringo tutto quello, che la Compagnia faceva sotto le logge, dirò al sacro Pilastro, giacchè in quei primi tempi non trovasi nei capitoli nominato Oratorio. In ogni sera adunque si cantavano le laudi da i fratelli chiamati Laudesi, e con maggior solennità di canto nelle vigilie delle feste del Signore , di Maria, degli Apostoli, e dei Santi Avvocati della Citta, facendosi nella notte precedente a simiglianti Feste una illuminazione generale di tutta la Loggia, In tutte le Domeniche dell’anno , ed in altri giorni solenni facevasi fare la predica nella Loggia per sufficienti Predicatori, scelti o dal Clero, o dalle Religioni, delle quali prediche l’ora era dopo il Vespro. Quattro poi guardie in tutta la giornata assidue tenevansi al Pilastro, e due nella notte per ricevere le offerte di cera, di vesti, e di danaro, e talora erano più copiose le limosine, che facevansi di notte, E finalmente al terzo capitolo pertinenti sono gli esempi di carità , e di pietà, che dai fratelli davansi e per la Città, e per il Contado: devotissime erano due processioni generali di tutta la Compagnia in Ciascun’anno a due di queste Chiese, S. Marco, S. Spirito, S. Croce, S. Maria Novella , il Carmine, e la Nonziata, ripigliando il giro ogni tre anni, coll’offerta per ciascuno Fratello di una candela di un’oncia. Ogni Lunedì si facevano celebrar sei Messe in varie Chiese per i Fratelli defunti, sicché a tutte dentro l’anno toccava almeno una Messa, alla quale assister dovea un’Ufiziale della Compagnia dando dodici soldi al Prete. Ma la cosa più plausibile era una limosina generale , oltre le quotidiane, la quale facevasi in tutti i Sesti di Firenze, e nel suo Contado, e per vero dire era il giorno di tutto l’anno il più lieto per i poveri, tra quali comprendevansi tutti i Monasteri , Spedali , Prigioni , e Romiti, trovandosi nei Libri della Compagnia avere importato somigliante carità talvolta 37000. lire, delle quali cose andò viepiù crescendo la fama della nostra Madonna di Or S. Michele, e della Compagnia a lei dedicata. E se ho sin quì ragionato del Libro dei Capitoli, mi si conceda di riportare il titolo, che leggesi nel principio di altro Libro detto Campion Verde, ed è come segue : “Codex bonorum piissima Societatis Gloriosissime Virg. Maria S. Michaelis in Orto, merito in toto Orbe re &amp; fama memoratissima, ob suum devotissimum Oratorium sub famoso Templo , ac su pramodnm Eminentissimo, eius nomine fundatum pariter &amp; sonstrutum.”</p>

<p>Ma avendo chiamata più fiate miracolosa questa Immagine, qui dir si vuole i moltiplici miracoli a quel Pilastro gia corona facienti, e con tanta abbondevolezza, 
che Giovanni Villani arrestando il corso alla sua Storia, come a cosa insolita, e di grande stupore , ne scrisse le seguenti parole “Adì 3. di Luglio 1292. si cominciò a mostrare grandi, e aperti miracoli nella Città di Firenze per una figura di S. Maria dipinta in un Pilastro della Loggia di Or S. Michele, dove si vende il grano, sanando infermi, e rizzando attratti, e sgombrando imperversaci visibilmente in gran quantità” E lo stesso afferma S. Antonino nella Terza Parte di sua Storia come appresso: Eodem anno (1292.) mense Iulii patrata sunt quadam miracula Florentia ex quadam Figura Virginis Gloriosa, qua erat in pariete picta atrii, seu horti S. Michaelis, ubi tunc forum erat frument, &amp; aliorum bladorum. Nam concepta devotione ab omnibus ad Figuram illam infirmis devote orantibus, plures sanati sunt exvariis languoribus, claudi erecti, contracti sanati, &amp; obsessi a doemonibus liberati. E gli stessi prodigi si rammentano di questo Santo Simolacro da Sozomeno Pistoiose nella sua Istoria generale del mondo, la quale in cartapecora conservasi nella libreria dei Canonici Regolari della Badia di Fiesole, come scrive nella sua Biblioteca Pistoiese il Padre Antonio Zaccaria, che non gran diligenza, e somma erudizione ho dato alle stampe, leggendosi nella suddetta Istoria come segue: Anno 1292. Die 3. Mensis Iulii Figura picta B. Virginis Maria, qua erat in horto S. Michaelis fecit multa miracula sanando infirmos &amp; elaudos, unde fuit maxima devotio totius populi &amp; finitimorum, &amp; tantum aucta est, quod singulis annis distribuebantur sex mille libbra, &amp; usque ad hodiernum diem extat devotio. Ed in sì fatta guisa parlano tutti gli Scrittori Toscani, niuno però, che io sappia, avendo notato il più ammirabile di tutti i prodigi, che fu l’essere la stessa miracolosa Tavola rimasa illesa dall’incendio in Firenze procurato da Ser Neri Abati nel 1304., avendo per altro le fiamme arse non solamente le case contigue, ma la Loggia stessa. Altri miracoli ancora si possono osservare dipinti nei vetri delle finestre, le quali è stato creduto da taluno, che fossero le prime in città a vedersi dipinte, dopo che di fiandra fu portato il segreto a Firenze. Intanto la quantità, e qualita di questi miracoli produsse vari effetti, quali io non posso non rammentare, ed il primo derivato da sì alta cagione fu, che alcuni religiosi maestri in divinita, non dando facilmente fede ai quotidiani prodigi, che raccontavansi, giudicarono in materia sì gelosa di culto, e di fede, di fare alcuni esami sopra la verita dei prodigi, e darne al popolo saggi avvertimenti, cosa che loro suscito una piccola persecuzione della plebe, imputando loro ad invidia quello, che era puro zelo della gloria di Dio, e di Marià, come ne scrive S. Anronino nella Terza Parte della sua Storia, rigettando il detto mordace di Giovanni Villani, e di altri Scrittori, e le parole del Santo sono le seguenti : Fratres’ autem Predicatores &amp; Minores, quia parum fidei dabant dictis miraculis, Populus, qui leviter movetur, eis detrahebat, &amp; obloquebatur contra eos, adscribens invidia, quod erat vera pietatis. Ma un altro effetto ben contrario al suddetto seguì dalla stupenda abbondevolezza dei miracoli, i qualì a tutte le ore tirando poveri infermi, e concorrendovi moltissimi curiosì ad essere testimoni di soprannaturali avvenimenti, e risuonando l’aria di mille benedizioni, ne venne, che la Loggia destinata alla vendita del grano, era ad ogni ora ingombrata dalla folla dei divoti, onde fu costretta la Signoria a serrarela Loggia , e non ho ben certo l’anno, riducendola a Chiesa, non senza grave rammarico ed opposìzione di parecchi Cittadini del Gran Consglio, cui spiaceva , che fosse levata la bellezza alla più maestosa fabbrica di Firenze , e che noi a suo tempo descriveremo. Le somme poi larghissìme depositate nelle mani dei Custodi del Pilastro, ed i iasciti considerabilissimi, furono il terzo, e principal frutto delle tante miracolose grazie. Io però delle molte, e ricche offerte una sola per ora ne riferirò, e fu quella, che fecero i Fiorentini nel 1348. anno della gran peste, trovandosi nei libri dei Capitani di Or S. Michele, che ascendesse alla somma di Fiorini d’oro 35,000. chiamata da Matteo Villani tesoro incredibile per lo valore della Moneta, che non si legge un lascito così grosso tutto in un anno fosse fatto giammai a nestun altro Santuario di quei tempi.</p>

<p>Ma dappoichè di questa Immagine abbiamo rammentati i pregi di sua antichità , e dei suoi miracoli, ragion vuole, che parliamo degli onori ricevuti e dal Pubblico, e dai Privati ; e per non istare a narrare la lunga serie delle ordinazioni fatte dalla Repubblica riguardanti il culto dì nostra Donna, io me ne sono scelte alquante delle più memorabili, che sono contrassegni pregiatissimi di onorevolezza a questo Oratorio, rimettendo ad altra Lezione il porre in veduta le sollecitudini della Signoria in volere adornata la Loggia delle più commendate opere dell’Architettura, Scultura, e Pittura. Principiando adunque da quell’azione , la quale accrebbe divozione, e insìememente rispetto grandissìmo verso il Santo Tabernacolo, non vi ha dubbio, che ella fu, l’essersi presa dalla Repubblica per Avvocata speciale dei Fiorentini la Madonna di Or S. Michele a voce di tutto il popolo convocato nella gran Piazza dei Signori nel 13.di Agosto del 1365. Al suono della Campana grossa, come era solito a farsi in tutte le risoluzioni gravi; e correlativa a questa elezione fu la Legge del 1366. colla quale ad ogni Cittadino statuale si ordinava di mandare a Or S. Michele un drappellone; e se era Uomo di arme, una Targa; ed a questo stesso fine retto dalla pietà, che più desiderar non si poteva verso il Santuario , per altra Legge del 1386. si aspettava ai Rettori delle Chiese, ed ai Superiori delle Religioni nella Festa dell’Assunta di fare un’offerta a questo Altare, sul quale nello stesso solennissimo giorno il Gonfaloniere servendo di esempio a tutti , a mezza Messa offeriva quì un regalo di frutte. Ma aumentandosi sempremai l’ardore in tutti di fare nuovi onori a Maria, inventò dipoi il Popolo Figure di uomini ritratti al naturale alti quanto il vivo, colle teste, e mani di cera colorita, con capelliere, vesti, fogge, ed ogni altro ornamento all’usanza di quei tempi, e di somiglianti voti se n’empiè talmente la Loggia, che per proverbio si diceva, quando si voleva significare una moltitudine di cose “Sarebbon’elleno mai tante quanti i Boti di Gr. S, Michele ?” dei quali parla pure S. Antonino nella Parte Terza della sua Storia così; &amp; in proccssu temporis est repletus locus imaginibus cereis. E tornando alle sante Leggi della Repubblica riguardanti la venerazione, e stima di si pregiatissìma Immagine , non si deve tacere quella, che obbligava gli uomini di governo a giurare suIl’altar venerabile di Or S. Michele direttamente amministrare le cose del pubblico , ed attestano i Libri di Ricordanze di quei tempi, che nessuno si Sarébbe accostato con livida coscienza per farvì giuramento o pubblico, o privato, tenendosi per certo da tutti, che se la intenzione loro non fosse stata sincera, si sarebbero veduti gastighi esemplari; e trovasi un’antico Statuto alla Rubrica 115. del Libro II. col quale nullo si dichiarava qualunque giuramento, che non fosse stato fatto su questo Altare: Nullo modo valeat, neque observetur, nisi tale iuramentum praestitum fuerit coram B. Virgine, &amp; Capitaeneis Orti S. Michaelis. E da un Libro della Compagnia di Or S, Michele coperto di asse si ha il seguente privilegio “1329. ordina la Repubblica Fiorentina, che chi aveste ammazzato alcun suo parente, o altro congiunto, al quale aveste potuto succedere il delinquente nella Eredità , questi ne sia spogliato, e la terza parte dei beni dell’ucciso vadano alla Compagnia della Vergine Maria di Orto San Michele , ed il restante al Comune di Firenze.” Si pensò ancora dai Signori ad accrescere con isquisiti concerti di suono, e canto il pregio, e concorso alle Laudi, che si dicevano all’Oratorio in ogni sera, avendo la Repubblica ordinato con Legge del 1388. che i Musici della Citta, ed i Sonatori di pifferi, e viole di Palazzo nei Sabati, e nelle Feste solenni venissero ad Or S. Michele, costume per vero dire, che in qualche parte ancora in oggi si conserva.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E quì mi si conceda, benchè fuori del suo luogo, di aggiugnere due partite di limosine fatte dalla Compagnia di Or S. Micheìe , quali possono dar lume alla Storia Fiorentina, e che non seppi, quando sopra scrissi dei Capitoli della Compagnia, avendole avute dal Sig. Domenico Maria Manni, che le trovò nei libri della medesima, e sono “1306 limosina Fior. ic, aila Giovanna Romita da Signa, portò Chele Lapi Laudese da San Friano.” Questa è la Beata da Signa, e dice il Libro a carte 49. per suo mantenimento, o per dispensarla. Nel Libro del 1307 vi ha altra limosina, e dice a persona, che sta sulle Fosse della Porta dell’Alloro Oste (cioè pigionale) Giotto di Bondone, questi è l’insigne restaurator della Pittura.

E per fine in lode di questo Oratorio riporterò alcuni versi del celebre Fra Domenico da Coiella Scrittore del Secolo XV. non meno celebre per le teologiche sue opere, che per la poetica arte , come nota il dotto Autore delle Delizie degli Eruditi nel suo Tomo del 1742. al quale abbiamo grado l’avere dato alle stampe del suddetto Autore il IV. Libro di Elegie sopra le Chiese Fiorentine, dove dice come appresso: 

"Attamen apparet longe spatiosior intus,  Fulget ubi Sancta Matris imago Dei.  Hans miro candore nitens complectitur arcus,  Sculptilibus pollens undique marmoreis  Quorum compages tanta contexitur arte,  Ut fibi vix aliud par videatur opus."

<p>Seconda Lezione</p>

<p>Motivi dei Grandi nell’ordinare fabbriche assai magnifiche, sogliono essere il genio di voler dimostrare la loro possanza, e ricchezza, ed insiememente il sollecito impegno di accrescere ornamento alle Citrà, e comodo a Cittadini. Ed appunto somiglianti fini ebbe 
la Repubblica Fiorentina nella fabbrica maestosa, e splendidissima di Or S. Michele. Erano i Fiorentini saliti in gran potenza per mezzo del negozio, e volendo palesare agli occhi di tutto il Mondo lo splendor del loro stato felicemente conservatosi libero, e di più far costare ai Principi il sovrano potere fondato nel valor di molte ricchezze conquistate dalle arti, alzarono questo maraviglioso edifizio, anche in oggi uno dei principali ornamenti di Firenze, destinato già alla conserva dei grani, e dipoi alla custodia della pubblica fede per Archivio Generale. Né debbo tralasciare un altro più nobile motivo derivato dalla pietà Fiorentina verso il miracoloso Tabernacolo della Madonna di Or S. Michele, al cui onore vollero i Signori, che in questo Tempio gareggiassero le maraviglie dell’Architettura, della Scultura, e della Pittura, quali ravviseremo noi in questa Lezione. E facendomi dalla ordinazione fatta dalla Repubblica per il soprallodato fine, benchè se ne sia smarrito l’originale , ne riporterò una imperfetta copia enunciata nel Campione, o sia Libro Verde dei Capitani di Or S. Michele al Cap. X. Templum in statura &amp; forma Palatii cum volta supra coopriente Oratorium, &amp; alia deinceps, &amp; tesso, atquesor formosis beccatellis, ubi tabernaculum Nostra Donna splendidssimum, &amp; supra modum superbissimum, nec non miris vitris, porfido, &amp; gemmis maximi valoris fundatum super Platea, ubi consueverat esse sorum denominatum Orto di S.

Flor an. 1309 De mense Aprilis.</p>

<p>Abbiamo adunque da così autorevole Libro col pubblico Decreto della nuova Fabbrica la deputazione orrevole dell’ Arte della Seta, detta di Por S. Maria, per la felice e grandiosa esecuzione, e l’epoca certa della fondazione, o piuttosto della innovazione di questo Edifizio, cioè l’anno 1309. A Taddeo Gaddi, in quel tempo Architetto del Pubblico toccò a fare il disegno, che se non prima del 1337 non principiò a rifondare i pilastri:  l’impedimento fu cagionato e dall’assedio di Firenze postovi dall’Imperatore Enrico VII. nemico dei Fiorentini fin che visse, e dalla guerra coi Pisani, e Lucchesi , e dalle discordie intestine. Ma ritornata la calma, nel 29 di Luglio del suddetto anno se ne gettò la prima pietra dal Gonfaloniere Strozza di Rosso Strozzi, presente la Signoria, tutti i Magistrati, e seguitati da tutta la gente, colla benedizione del Vescovo Fiorentino Francesco Silvestri 
da Cingoli. Di così solenne funzione ne parlò Giovanni Villani nel Libro XI. al Capitolo 66. che tralasciando io di riferire, per non ripetere le cose di sopra dette, piuttosto riporterò alquante circostanze notate da Leopoldo dei Migliore a pagina 540. come segue “La funzione, che si faceva a nome dei Guelsi, che erano quelli che dominavano la Città, mai ridottasi in sì felice stato quanto allora, si accompagnò anche col getto di monete d’oro, e di argento, coniate da una parte con l’edifìzio , e queste lettere : Ut magnificentia Populi Flor. 
„ Artis, &amp; Artificum ostendatur, e dall’altra parte l’Armi della Repubblica, e del medesimo Popolo, e si leggeva : Reip. &amp; Popili Honor &amp; Decus. Chi lo racconta, che per avventura fu presente, dice di più, come anche l’Ambasciatore della Città di Arezzo , vi buttasse non so che moneta piccola. “E sin quì l’Autore della Firenze illustrata. In quanti anni poi fosse la Fabbrica ridotta alla sua perfezione e vaghezza, non è possibile il determinarlo; conciosiacosachè vi si ravvisano tralle pitture alquante di Iacopo da Casentino, di Lorenzo di Credi, di Andrea del Sarto, e di Gio: Antonio Sogliani; fra i tondi, tre se ne veggono di Luca della Robbia, e tralle Statue parecchie di Donatello, e dei suoi Discepoli, che furono tutti Artefici del Secolo XV Onde fa d’uopo il dire, che o vi fossero innovazioni sempre più belle, o che tardi assai si desse l’ultimo compimento al nobile disegno. Avvi pure un altro dubbio circa chi ne fosse l’Architetto: imperciocchè in una cartella in Chiesa leggesi Autore Arnolfo di Lapo; Leopoldo del Migliore ne dà la lode ad Andrea Orcagna, ed il Baidinucci ne fa Architettore Taddeo Gaddi. Ma io credo, che tutti e tre dicano il vero, solo che distinguiamo i tempi, stabilendo che nel 1284 giusta tutti gli Scrittori, Arnolfo per ordine della Signoria fabbricasse la Loggia, in secondo luogo, che nel 1337 Taddeo Gaddi ne rifondasse i pilastri, che erano di mattoni, rivestendogli di pietra, e di marmi, e per fine morto il Gaddi nel 1350. giusta il Vasari, o nel 1352 secondo il Baldinucci, vi lavorasse l’Orcagna, che appunto all’altare della Madonna leggessi questi essere stato Architetto nel 1359. Andreas Cionis Pictor buius Oratorii Arcbimagifter 1359 Circa poi la spesa, scrive il Varchi, che arrivasse ad ottantasei mila fiorini di oro da stimarsi grandissima in ordine al valore della moneta di quei tempi, e ventimila in ridurla da Loggia ad uso di Chiesa, come si è detto di sopra: e donde si cavasse questo danaro, senza aggravare il Comune di nuovo dazio, io trovo nei Libri di Provvisioni agli anni 1339 e 1350. che furono assegnate all’Arte della Seta per proseguir la fabbrica certe gabelle chiamate delle sette Piazze, della Mallevadoria dell’Armi, e che il Villani le addimanda Gabellette, quasi che con questo diminutivo significar volesse, come il poco assegnato , avesse moltiplicato tanto per la felicità del Commercio, da essersi potuta alzar Mole così eccelsa. Mi piace però rammentare un’entrata, che ha dell’incredibile, ma ella è registrata nel libro detto Campione a car 14. ed inoltre dal Villani è notata al Lib. XI. Cap. 91. Questa entrata era la spazzatura della Loggia di Or S. Michele, e prestatura di bigonce , dalla quale cavavansi ogni anno 750 fiorini di oro, dovendosi ancora quì comprendere le stupende limosine, che si facevano dai devoti alla miracolosa Immagine, porzione delle quali si applicava al magnifico ornamento di questo sovrano, e ricchissimo Tempio.</p>

<p>E veramente si mostrerà convenirgli questa lode, e molto maggiore ancora, per quel che diremo in descriverne le qualità. La forma sua è quasi quadrangolare, lunga essendo braccia 42 e larga 32. Si alza dal piano della strada alla cima braccia 80 tutta veggendosi incrostata di pietra forte riquadrata, di quella , che resistendo all’acqua, ed ai rigori delle stagioni, se ne murarono, dice il Vasari , quasi tutti gli edifici alla gotica, che si fecero in Toscana in quei tempi, della quale Architettura barbara è anco questa Torre, sebbene in essa si vede un dei primi miglioramenti dell’Arte, nel ricominciar, che ella fece a rinvigorire, e pigliar forza, osservandovisi gli archi, che lasciato il sello acuto sono girati con grazia a porzione di circolo, sopra a pilastri principali della volta vi sono due ordini di Finestroni adornati nei vani di colonnette di marmo, veggendosi nei triangoli dei frontespizi principali le armi della Repubblica, e della Parte Guelfa reiterate in più luoghi, ed ancora sonovi quelle della Casa Reale di Napoli, che è uno scudo dimezzato per lo lungo, da una parte pieno di gigli, dall’altra di listre in piano per il Regno di Ungheria, posseduto, allorachè questa Loggia si fabbricava, da Lodovico di Angiò figliolo di Carlo, che fu tanto amico dei Fiorentini, Protettore, e fermezza del loro stato in favore dei Guelfi, e per segno di gratitudine la Repubblica vi alzò quelle armi, essendo questa la maggior benevolenza, che professasse mai Firenze verso nessun’altro Potentato. Finisce la fabbrica con una corona di rose traforate, che sportando in fuori ,e retta con grazia su certi beccatelli, vi rigira intorno a guisa di parapetto, o sponda. E venendo al terreno ricorre attorno un imbasamento di pietra alto da terra poco più di quattro braccia fino alle nicchie, nelle quali sonovi le Statue dei Santi Avvocati delle Arti, parte di metallo, e parte di marmo, di tutto rilievo, essendo alte più del vivo, e per condurle a perfezione vi si stancò per dir così l’industria dei primi Maestri, e  Professori di quei tempi, senza risparmio di spesa in ricompensa del loro valore, parlandosene in un Libro alle Riformagioni segnato F. come appresso “Sapendosi quanto importi dar cuore a chi operando con industria per mero parto dell’intelletto, cerca a lasciar di se onoratissimo nome, e fama alla Patria per mezzo di fatture rare: si vuole, che largamente se ne ricompensino quelli, che già sono stati eletti a far pompa del loro talento, e sapere intorno alle Statue di Or S. Michele.”</p>

<p>E per dar ragguaglio di queste Statue principiando dalla parte di Levante a venire dalla via dei Calzaioli, nella prima nicchia evvi S. Luca, segue S. Tommaso, e poi S. Gio; Batista ; verso Mezzodì la prima è di S. Giovanni Evangelista, di S. Giorgio la seconda, viene S. Iacopo, e la quarta è di S. Marco: dalla parte del Magistrato della Lana nel primo pilastro incontrasi S. Lò, dopo vedesi S. Stefano, ed in terzo luogo S. Matteo: e voltando a Tramontana la prima nicchia è vacante per un certo caso, che poi diremo; la seconda è dei quattro Santi , dopo la quale evvi S. Filippo, e nell’ultima San Piero. E ripigliando da S. Luca, ella è di getto fatta da Giovan Bologna per l’Arte dei Giudicì e Notai, o sia del Proconsolo, la cui arme è una stella di oro, che empie tutto il campo di argento, intagliata negli angoli della base. S. Tommaso è di Andrea del Verrocchio discepolo di Donatello per non dire emolo del Maestro, tanto è vivo il Santo, che sembra camminare portato dall’amore a toccare la piaga di Cristo: fu fatto a spese della Mercanzia , che ha per impresa una stella rossa sopra una balla bianca: in virtù di un pubblico Decreto in questa nicchia doveasi collocare S. Lodovico ; il perchè si recedesse da quest’ordine non lo sappiamo; bensì per mercede dell’Artefice ho letto nel Campione Verde, che nel 1483 si ordina, che Andrea sia di tal fattura sodisfatto fino in 800 fiorini Iarghi. II S. Giovan Batista spetta all’Arte dei Mercatanti, già Consoli di Calimala, che portano un’Aquila di oro sopra una balla bianca in campo rossò: la fattura è del Ghiberti, il cui nome è scritto nel lembo dell’abito: ma convien confessare essere figura languida in comparazione delle altre sue opere meravigliose. Il S. Giovanni Evangelista anch’egli di bronzo è opera di Baccio da Montelupo, che lo fece per l’ Arte della Seta con diligenza estrema e felice , della quale Arte l’impresa è una porta rossa in campo di argento. Segue il S. Giorgio, il quale prima stava nella sua nicchia a Tramontana molto proporzionata alla sua grandezza, e poscia diremo la cagione della traslazione; la fecero fare i Corazzai, e Spadai, che fanno per arme un giaco, ed uno stocco : questa figura è stimata da tutti la più bella, ed oltre a quel che ne dice il Vasari, il Bocchi ne ha fatto un trattato intitolato L’Eccelenza della Statua di S. Giorgio fatta da Donatello, che fu stampato nel 1584. dal Marescotti. Alla vicina nicchia viene la Statua di S. Iacopo dell’Arte dei Vaiai, i quali in un campo di azzurro fanno per arme una pecora bianca, e molti vai: piace assai la maniera di questo Santo lavorato da Nanni di Antonio del Bianco. Di Donatello è il S. Marco, di cui Michelagnolo, dicono, che dicesse: “che se tale era il sembiante del Santo vivo gli si poteva creder tutto quanto aveva scritto, tanto mostra cera di galantuomo. Del soprallodato Nanni è San Lò lavorato per l’Arte dei Maniscalchi, come lo dimostra l’Arme loro, che è un paio di tanaglie nere, ed appiè della Statua vedesi un basso rilievo di alcuni occupati ad un’incudine. Ammirabile è il S. Stefano, degna opera del Ghiberti, in premio della quale ebbe anche la grazia di fare l’altra che segue di S. Matteo, quella è dell’Arte della Lana avente per Arme una pecora bianca con banderola bianca, e croce rossa in campo azzurro; questa è dell’ Arte del Cambio, la cui divisa è un campo seminato di monete di oro; e nell’Archivio di detta Arte si conserva un Libro, nel quale oltre il leggersi l’allogazione della Statua al suddetto Ghiberti, trovasi il maneggio di quei Consoli per ottenere questa Nicchia, che era stata data per l’avanti all’Arte dei 
Fornai per collocarvi la figura di S. Lorenzo loro Protettore: ma stante che ella era Arte poverissima, e che né di presente, né per l’avvenire avrebbero potuto fare una grande spesa, la Signoria nel 21 di Giugno del 1419 essendo Gonfaloniere Niccolò di Franco Sacchetti, col consenso dei medesimi Fornai concedette la Nicchia all’Università dei Cambiatori per farvi la figura di S. Matteo, per la quale ebbe Lorenzo 650. fiorini di oro. Sono anche da osservarsi su questa Nicchia due statuette di marmo lavorate con lode da Niccolò Aretino. Dopo questa viene la nicchia vuota, ove non è rimaso, che nella base un prodigioso mezzo rilievo di Donatello, rappresentante S. Giorgio, che occide il Drago, lodato da Raffaello Borghini con queste parole “si può mirare, ma non imitare” I quattro Santi sono del Nanni, fatti da quattro Arti di Maestri, di scure, o accetta, di scarpello, di mestola, e di altri strumenti fabbrili. La invenzione di collocarveli, che portava sapere per la strettezza del luogo, pose in disperazione l’Artefice, ma il di lui Maestro Donatello colla sola ricompensa d’una cena, a forza di alcuni colpi industriosi scantonò di quelle Statue a chi la spalla, a chi le braccia, talchè ponendo l’una per così dire addosso all’altra, le commesse di modo, che non solo copri l’errore del discepolo, ma riscosse stima, e meraviglia da tutti. Non è dispregevole il S. Filippo, che gli è allato nell’altra nicchia, fatto dal medesimo Nanni alla Università dei Calzolai, quali portano tre listre nere in piano di argento. Ma di vero il S. Piero dell’Arte dei Beccai, quali alzano per arme un becco rampante in campo di argento, è fatto da Donatello 
con tanto sapere, che è tenuto dal Vasari opera mirabile e rarissima, dove è un panneggiare graziosissimo corrispondente all’attitudine del corpo, in guisa, che meglio non istanno i panni indosso ad uomo vivente.</p>

<p>Questo apparato di Statue unire così, ed esposte al pubblico si vede in poche Città, e molti sono venuti di lontani paesi a bella posta per vederle, confessando esser loro parute una Scuola di cose rare da potersene pigliar copia con qualche riserva; e per cagione del rispetto, che convenevolmente pretesero i Fiorentini, che si portasse a sì preziose nicchie, abbiamo lo Statuto, che impone pena a chi o vi tirasse sassi, o facessè loro qualche oltraggio. Bella veduta ancora fanno i vani degli Archi tra un pilastro, e l’altro, adornati di quattro altissime colonne, su ciascuna delle quali posa una Statua di un braccio e mezzo di altezza, che in tutte sono quaranta, veggendosi i capitelli e dei pilastri, e delle colonne ornati a foglia di acanto rustica, siccome vaghissimi sono i rabeschi, che empiono gli archi, restando da osservarsi sopra le nicchie le pitture nei dodici tondi, totalmente guaste, eccettuate tre che sono di terra inverniciata di Luca della Robbia, rappresentanti una Madonna col Bambino in collo sopra il pilastro di S. Giorgio,  l’Arme della Repubblica sopra S. Tommaso, e sopra S. Giovanni Evangelista la divisa dell’Arte di Por Santa Maria. Resterebbemi a ragionare dell’accennata traslazione in Chiesia della Statua della Madonna dalla nicchia della Università dei Medici, e Speziali, nella quale oggi si vede collocato San Giorgio. Ma dovendosi in altra Lezione assembrare i moltiplichi pregi rilucenti nell’ interiore de Tempio, in essa parleremo ancora della Sroria di questo Simolacro, riportando quì per fine in lode di tale Meravigliosa fabbrica altri versi del celebre Poeta Domenicano, e sono i seguenti:</p>

<p>“Nunc ubi magna domus pracelsa turris ad instar Fertur in aereas altius una plagas.<br />
Qua licet ex omni videatur splendida parte Sanctorum Statuas dum soris ipsa tenet. Attamen apparet longe speciosor intus Fulget ubi Sancta Matris Imago Dei.”</p>

<p>Terza Lezione</p>

<p>Il ragionare degli interiori pregi di questa Chiesa con ordine, non si può quasi fare senza deferenza al prodigioso Altare della Madonna di Or S. Michele già da noi descritto nella prima Lezione di questa Storia, dovendo qui aggiungere ai sopraddetti titoli, i laudevoli usi fatti di sue grandi ricchezze assembrate nel florido stato della Repubblica, ed il sacro quotidiano servizio a quell’Altare. E per farmi dal primo ne noterò un lolo documento indicante i gran tesori spesì in opere pie dai Superiori dell’Oratorio, mercechè i Capitani 
oltre lo splendido, e nobile mantenimento della Chiesa, potettero somministrare grandi somme di danaro per le fabbriche dei Monasteri di Chiarito, di Lapo, e di San Giorgio, i quali sono oggi reputati al pari di ogni altro Monastero esemplare di Firenze, constando queste fondazioni dai rogiti di Ser Michele di Ghirolfo da Lucardo 1342 e di Ser Salvestro Salvesfri 1405 nell’Archivio Generale. Circa poi al secondo punto riferir mi piace la istituzione fatta dalla Rep nel 1415. di una Collegiata di dieci Preti, e due Cherici, con un Capo loro chiamato Proposto; la quale erezione trovasi registrata in un Libro coperto di asse nell’Archivio dei Capitani, ove sì legge ancora , che fino a quei tempo l’Oratorio era stato ufiziato da un solo Prete col titolo di Sagrestano. Questi Preti hanno il privilegio dei Cappuccio pavonazzo, e coll’intervento dei Musici assistono alle solite Laudi di Maria nelle Feste, ed in ogni Sabato alio scoprimento della sacra Immagine col canto delle Litanie, nel qual tempo ardono 26 candele con questo ordine di 12 all’Altare, 6  ai viticci, ed otto alla ghirlanda, siccome nella Messa alla Consacrazione sempre debbono accendersi due Ceri per legato di Luca di Filippo Carnesecchi Gentiluomo Fiorentino, il quale nel suo Testamento del 1601, rogato da Ser Antonio di Ser Chello dice “Lascio due doppieri di cera gialla di libbre 15 in perpetuo da accendersi alla Madonna di Or S. Michele nel tempo della elevazione dell’ Ostia.</p>

<p>E passando ora a rammentar quanto di sacro, e di bello avvi in quest’Oratorio dirò, che appoggiato al pilastro, che sta allato a questa Cappella, trovasi un Crocifisso di legno in gran venerazione appresso i Fiorentini, con tutto che sia mal fatto, di maniera antica, alto più del vivo. Credesi sull’autorità di tutti gli Scrittori della vita del Santo Arcivescovo Antonino, che egli fusse consueto andarvi ad orare, quando era fanciullo, che in quell’età vedesi dipinto appiè della Croce. Non ci pare però di potere acconsentire a chi senza autorevole documento disse, che quel Crocifisso parlasse più fiate al Santo, e molto meno che sia lavorato del legno di quell’Olmo secco, il quale rifiorì nella traslazione del corpo di S. Zanobi, credo però al Rondinelli, che nel suo Ragguaglio della peste dice come segue  “I Frati di S. Marco molti Venerdì in processione andarono al Crocifisso di Or S. Michele, al quale S. Antonino fanciulleto orava” ringraziar debbo que’Benefattori, i quali nell’anno 1714 fecero a questo divino Simolacro un Tabernacolo di ricco intaglio attorno tutto dorato con baldacchino, e pendoni pavonazzi, e frangia di oro. Lì dirimpetto nel secondo pilastro osservasi una figura a fresco del buon ladrone, che si troverà in pochi luoghi così dipinto all’antica, avendolo il pittore non solamente confitto in Croce coi chiodi, ma legate le gambe con funi, acciocché non si confondesse con Cristo Gesù, e così notò il Molano essere stata la Chiesa consueta di fare . Questa pittura però fu quì collocata per la seguente cagione, notata 300 anni sono nei Libri della Compagnia della Croce al Tempio, e ricopiata da Vincenzio del Corno Gentiluomo Fiorentino amatore delle cose antiche nei suoi Ricordi, e leggesi negli Spogli di Leopoldo del Migliore, come segue “1361. N. N. condannato alla forca, era di Famiglia più che mediocremente civile; poche ore prima di esser condotto al pratello, parlò ad un Fratello della Compagnia dei Neri solita ad assistere queo da doversene fare pubblico spettacolo, e dissegli come in sua casa appiè del Ponte Vecchio aveva in un cassòne riposta una somma di danaro, e che la sua intenzione era di voler far dipingere in Or S. Michele al pilastro vicino all’Oratorio una figura del buon ladrone, acciò pregasse Dio, che gli usasse in quel breve respiro quella misericordia, che rese lui beato. Chi eseguì ii Legato ha scritto questo ricordo“, Questa Immagine fu dipinta da Iacopo Landini da Prato Vecchio detto il Cafentino, di lui essendo quasi tutte Ie altre, toltene alcune poche, di cui faremo qui menzione.</p>

<p>Di Iacopo adunque è la volta, ove rappresentò sedici tra Patriarchi e Profeti, i quali posano sur’un campo di azzurro oltramarino, colore che costò assai, per la fresca invenzione ritrovata di estrarlo dalle preziose pietre di lapislazzuli; né mancarono Cittadini statuali di quei tempi, che ne mormorarono , paruta loro una spesa buttata , anzi uno strapazzo del danaro della Santissima Immagine: ma questo parlare ardito dispiacque tanto al popolo, che ne volle, dice il Cambi, una pubblica sodisfazione all’onore oltraggiato di Maria con la prigionia di uno di casa Foraboschi. E tornando a Iacopo di Casentino, suoi sono parimente i moltissimi Santi dipinti l’un sopra l’altro negli archi, tra un pilastro e l’altro , e nelle facce dei 16 pilastri, fuori che alquanti pochi, come il S. Bartolommeo lavoro finissimo di mano di Lorenzo di Credi, e al secondo pilastro in un ovato S. Maria Maddalena portata in Cielo dagli Àngioli di mano di Andrea del Sarto; siccome il S. Stèfano tra le due porte fu fatto dal Poppi, il quale fece ancora le due tavole, che sono in Coro, di Cristo, e di S. Giova Batista; dei Sogliani è il S. Martino rimpetto a S. Stefano, e suo credesì il S. Agostino in mezzo del Coro, benchè vi sia chi lo giudica dell’ AIbertinelli. Sotto l’organo Agnolo Gaddi pittore in quei tempi di grido rappresentò alla parete Cristo, che disputa in mezzo ai Dottori. Né io voglio tralasciare di riferire ciò che il Dottor Brocchi rammenta essere accaduto alla figura di S. Verdiana, la quale si vede al pilastro della cantonata di questa Chiesa riguardante il Mezzodì accanto alla immagine di S. Lucia. Essendo ella per l’antichità assai guasta fu fatta rifiorire nei nostri tempi, ma con grande discapito della Istoria, posciachè il Pittore scancellò la iscrizione, che vi era sotto scritta a caratteri gotici, e quello, che fu più strano, alla Santa mutato si vede l’abito di secolare , che aveva, in tonaca Religiosa.</p>

<p>Considerabile poi è la Cappella di S. Anna erettavi a spese del Comune dalla banda di Tramontana, per dovervisi commemorare in perpetuo l’atto di un’azione la più importante, che accader possa in una Repubblica libera , che fu la cacciata del Tiranno Duca di Atene, ed occupator violento del Dominio Fiorentino, seguita, giusta tutti gli Scrittori, nei 26, Luglio del 1343 giorno di Sant’Anna, la quale venne per questa grazia onorata fra i Protettori principali col titolo di Propitia , &amp; F. utrix libertatis Civitatis Florentina; e però, come apparisce alle Riformagioni Lib. B. del 1349 si fece il Decreto della Signorsa di spendere tremila fiorini di oro per la erezione in Or S. Michele di una Cappella ridotta nel 1526 a miglior ordine dai Capitani, veggendosi sull’Altare isolato la Santa figurata in marmo bianco pìù alta del vivo in atto di tenere in collo la Vergine Maria, che porta in seno il Bambino Gesù, opera lodatissima di Francesco da S. Gallo. A 26 di Luglio la Signoria v’interveniva ogni anno a offerta con tutte le Capitudini delle Arti, si correva un palio, ed altre cose di somma allegrezza facevansi in quel giorno, ordinate nello Statuto fatto nel 1343 ai 28 di Ottobre con questa bella introduzione di parole : Pro houore Reip. &amp; ad perpetuam memoriam libertatis Civitatis Florentia, &amp; ut Civium mentibus sit infixum, qualiter die S. Anna de mense Iulii Populus Flor per Dei gratiam, &amp; virtutem bonorum, a Tyrannide Ducis Atbernarum liberatus &amp;c. Ed in una tavola della Chiesa leggesi, che in questa Festa si espone la Reliquia della Santa, che si dà a baciare alla Centuria dei Fratelli, e Sorelle della Santissima Trinità.</p>

<p>Passandosi ora ad altra Cappella, è d’uopo, che io mi faccia a riferire quel tanto, che ho promedso nell’antecedente Lezione, parlando della nicchia degli Speziali, perchè una Madonna a sedere col Figlio in collo standovi collocata, e lavorata già da Simone da Fiesole allievo del Brunellesco, fu trasferita in Chiesa , e messa ad una delle due porte grandi chiusa per formarne una Cappella; e la cagione di ciò fu la seguente. Nell’anno 1628 il popolo a voce di parecchi, che asserivano con giuramento di aver veduta questa Statua muovere, e battere gli occhi, corse in grandissimo numero, ed in tanta folla di giorno, e di notte, che sì ebbe prima a sbarrar le strade per isfuggire il tumulto, gridando ognuno misericordia, che fu uno di quei preludi della peste, che venne dipoi a Firenze nel 1630. Poscia per deviare la gente devota, che non si sarebbe mai partita di lì, si pigliò dal Granduca Ferdinando espediente di trasferirla dentro. Del miracoloso avvenimento se ne fece processo per ordine dell’Arcivescovo Alessandro Marzimedici, ed uno dei disaminati, che depose di aver veduta la Statua aprire e serrare più volte gli occhi, fu il Canonico Cavaliere Giovanni Guidacci. A questa figura di Nostra Donna stando fuori nella sua nicchia accadde un altro caso in tempo di Repubblica, che in due versi inciso appiè del marmo anche in oggi si legge, e fu che un Marrano Giudeo di bel giorno senza tema di esser veduto la percosse con un ferro, ma il far ciò, e il vederlo morto, strascinato fu tutto un tempo; e questo sacrilego fatto viene anche scritto da Forese dà Ribatta nei Libri di sue Ricordanze, nelle quali vien di più a questo particolare, che il corpo di costui fosse buttato per ultimo vilipendio nella fogna di S. Stefano. E Ie parole intagliate nella base del marmo per memoria di questo fatto sono le qui appresso:</p>

<p>“Hanc ferro effigiem petiit ludeus, &amp; Index
  Ipse fibi vulgo dilaniatus obit MccccLxxXXlII.”</p>

<p>E conciosìacosachè in queste Lezioni si abbia frequentemente rammentato il titolo di Or S. Michele , non sia grave a chi legge , che io riporti l’origine di questo nome, come contenente non ispregevoli notizie, e specialmente dell’antichità, lo che non so se veramente lo dicano le Istorie, che di O. S. M. favellano: e però dispensandomi dall’esaminare il dubbio, se quivi già dal 750 vi fosse un’Oratorio dedicato al Santo Arcangelo, per camminare sul sicuro con documenti autorevoli, dirò primieramente, che poco dopo il mille vi era una Chiesa Parrocchiale, la quale contigua ad un Orto fu detta San Michele in Orto , venerabile per vero dire più di ogni altra, che ne fosse in Firenze con somigliante titolo, situata ella essendo nel più nobilitato luogo della Città; e che fosse Parrocchia è verità assai chiara dagli Strumenti antichissimi, che la dichiarano tale, come in un Testamento nell’Archivio di Badia n. 25. tra i Testimoni leggesi: Filippus Pieri Ranerii pop. S. Michaelis in orto 1100. Ed in molti contratti vetusti della famiglia dei Mozzi quì abitanti innanzi che passassero di là di Arno a S. Gregorio , trovansi accennati Populi San Michele in Orto. Come ella poi passasse ai Monaci Cisterciensi della Badia di S. Silvestro di Nonantola, non mi sono avvenuto sin qui a trovarlo: il vero si è, che Papa Innocenzio III. in una sua Bolla data in Viterbo nel 1209 già esistente presso le Monache del Paradiso, indicata dal Migliore a pag 540 conferma a detti Monaci con molte altre Chiese questa ancora di S. Michele: Ecclesias S. Felicis, S. Martini in Mamma, &amp; S. Michaelis intus Flor. La Repubblica poscia per suoi antichi diritti ne dovette riassumere il padronato, levandolo ai Cisterciensi; per la qual cosa seguì qualche disgusto con Roma, trovandosi alle Riformagioni una lettera del 1249. di Papa Innocenzio IV veduta dal Migliore, nella quale esortasi la Repubblica a render la Chiesa alla Badia di Nonantola, insieme col Castello di S. Martino. E quali fossero gli effetti di questa esortazione si può ravvisare dalle risoluzioni della Repubblica. Conciosiachè avendo la Signoria bisogno di una piazza per la vendita del grano, e di stanzoni per conservarlo, e considerato questo luogo molto opportuno, ne fece spianare la Chiesa, ordinando di darsi principio ad una Loggia, della quale parla il Migliore a pagina 530 così : “Col disegno di Arnolfo Panno 1284 che si era fondata sopra l’antica Chiesa di S. Michele.” Ma perchè non si perdesse la memoria di Chiesa così antica, debbo qui notare, come nello stesso tempo volle la Repubblica, che Arnolfo ne fabbricasse un’altra rimpetto alla nuova Loggia ; che è l’Oratorio presente, detto S Michele vecchio, ma in oggi S. Carlo per la cagione seguente. Si era di fresco canonizzato S. Carlo da Paolo.</p>

<p>E penetratasene la fama di sua santità per ogni dove, con riempiersi di divozione al Santo le Città principali, e massimamente Firenze, che in materia di Religione fu sempre mai ferventissima, quando il Cardinale Federigo Borromei Arcivescovo di Milano ricordevole dell’antico passaggio da questo Stato a quello di Milano, che fecero i Borromei, e del soggiorno fatto in questa Città dal Santo , volle, che delle Reliquie, le prime che fossero portate fuori di Milano, si mandassero a Firenze, che furono un gran pezzo della Camicia , ch’egli aveva addosso quando morì, e del suo sangue raccolto in una spugna sparato che fu. La solennità nel riceverle fu grandissima al pari della già conceputa divozione nel popolo, ma prevedendosi, che il luogo, ove queste si dovealo collocare sarebbe stato anguito assai per celebrarvi la sacra traslazione, e Cosimo II. volendo anch’egli dare un segno al suo solito di divozione, e grato mostrarsi alle cortesi offerte del Cardinale, l’Altezza sua sottoscrisse un Memoriale alla Compagnia dei Lombardi, cui erano esse Reliquie dirette , concedendo ai Fratelli l’oratorio di San Michele, come luogo più capace della Chiesa di S. Miniato tra le Torri, ove allora la Compagnia si ragunava, trasferitavi già da S. Pier del Murrone, oggi detto S. Giovannino in Via di S. Gallo, e volle Sua Altezza, che i Capitani di Or S. Michele, ai quali spettava il dominio dell’Oratorio, ne facessero la donazione per Decreto del 1616 contenente alcune condizioni, cioè di non mai la Compagnia mettervi alcuna sua Arme, e dell’onorificenza annua di un censo di cera da darsegli nel giorno di S. Michele. Allora fu levata dall’Altar Maggiore la tavola antichissima di Buonamico Bufalmacco rappresentante un Cristo morto, venendo trasferita sulla porta al di dentro, e fu collocata in suo luogo la tavola di Matteo Roselli, ove è S. Carlo vestito da Cardinale in una gloria figurata lucida, e risplendente con molti Angioli attorno, e fra essi nel primo luogo S. Michele con le sue insegne, secondo i patti, sperando così i Capitani di conservare vivo il titolo di S. Michele, prevedendosi , come è seguito, che la nuova venerazione a S. Carlo aveva a far dimenticare l’Oratorio di S. Michele, il quale è stato illustrato da Papa Alessandro VII nell’anno nono del suo pontificato di una perpetua Indulgenza per i Fratelli nella Festa di S. Carlo. La Tribuna dell’Altar grande, come dimostra l’Arme di una Colonna seminata di Vai affissa nell’arco con licenza dei Capitani, era stata in antico eretta dai Pilli Famiglia Consolare, della quale parla Dante nel Canto.</p>

<p>del Paradiso: grande era già la Colonna del Vajo. E nelle Scritture di Or S. Michele si legge “Altar Maggiore dell’Oratorio di S. Michele fatto in esecuzione del Testamento di Messer Bindo dei Pilli nell’anno 1376.” Ed a man manca entrando è osservabile una Tavola di Fabbrizio Boschi, avendo egli in essa effigiata con bel disegno e vivacità di colori la presentazione di Cristo al Tempio. Nell’Architrave della porta in segno del Padronato dei Capitani vedesi scolpita Ia loro divisa a caratteri di bronzo dorato, che sono le tre lettere O.S.M.</p>

<p>E tornando finalmente alla Loggia di Or. S. Michele, che si disse sostenere con 16 pilastri la gran torre fatta per il grano, e che poscia dal Granduca Cosimo I. giudicata per luogo atto a poter salvare le scritture dal fuoco, e dall’acqua fu destinata per Archivio Generale non posso tralasciare le lodi, che ne derivarono alla gloriosa memoria di questo Principe. Si pubblicò adunque una medaglia coll’effigie del Granduca, ed il suo nome; e nel rovescio la Porta dell’Archivio aperta con molti libri in essa fìgurati per Protocolli con corona ai Frontespizio, e lettere attorno, che dicevano: Publica Fidei. Evvi ancora a caratteri di oro una Iscrizione sulla Porta dell’Archivio situata in Calimala, e dice:</p>

<p>“ARCHIVIVM HOC PERPETVITATI PVBLICORVM MONIMENTORVM CONSERVANDAE DICATVM SERENISS COSMVS MED. 
 EREXIT. QVAMPRIMVM MAGNVS DVX HETRVRIAE SALVTATVS REGIAQVE corona insignitvs est mdlxix.”</p>

<p>E similmente alla Porta, che mette nello Stanzone delle Scritture, dove non si ammettono se non i Ministri senza lume, e senza fuoco, si legge pure a lettere indorate.</p>

<p>“FIDEI PVBLTCAE SERENIS.S. COSMVS MED. MAGNVS 
DVX ETRVRIAE EREXIT KAL. MARTIIS MDLXIX.”</p>

<p>E io quando mi credeva di avere qui terminato le mie Memorie Istoriche intorno ad Or S. Michele, debbo a queste arrogere una indispensabile notizia, senza la quale chi legge potrebbe prendere un’equivoco sopra gli Ufiziali di Or San Michele. Conciosiachè due Magistrati eranvi di simigliante appellazione, al primo dei quali spettava la cura di detta Piazza, o Loggia circa la vendita del grano, e delle biade , i quali durarono a cosi chiamarsi sino a tanto, che i Signori non fecero chiuderla la loggia mutata avendola in Chiesa, ed altrove trasferito il pubblico granaio; Al secondo Magistrato apparteneva il buon governo della Compagnia, e dell’Oratorio della Madonna di Or S. Michele, con un ampla iurisdizione sopra i beni donati alla Santissima Immagine. E questa differenza di ufizi apparisce nella Carnera Fiscale al Libro segnato 1344 contenente diverse scritture, biglietti, e cedole dei Priori al Podestà di Firenze, nel qual libro sotto il dì 27 di Febbraio leggonsi estratti per Ufiziali della loggia del grano di Or. S. Michele i seguenti: Filippus Rochi de Capponibus, Zenobius Lapi Risaliti, Dominicus Rizzini Fagioli, &amp; Mattheus Roselli Pictor Officiales extracti pro Comuni Flor. ad Officium Platea O. Si M. pro termino, &amp; tempore quatuor mensium. E con tale documento spiacemi di dover notare su questo proposito lo sbaglio del chiarissimo Leopoldo del Migliore alla pagina 369 della sua Firenze Illustrata, nella quale Egli scrisse, che il suddetto Matteo da Rosello fu dei Capitani della Madonna di Or S. Michele, nel Ruolo dei quali, che và copiato nelle mani di più studiosi, non si vede mai il detto Matteo. Ma se questi non trovasi al numero dei Capitani della Madonna, meritava però di essere messo da Giorgio Vasari nel numero dei Pittori, così denominato nella sopra riferita elezione. E tra le opere di lui è considerata la dipintura dell’Inferno, che aveva fatto nella Chiesa di S. Michele dei Visdomini giusta il suddetto Leopoldo del Migliore alla detta Pagina, dove dice come segue “Dipinti al naturale erano in 5, quello inferno molti uomini tristi di quella età, fra quali il Duca di Atene coi suoi seguaci, come traditori della Signoria dì Firenze nel più caro che è la libertà, o ladri, !e male lingue, e quei che si erano mostrati contrari al pubblico interesse, che chi gli aveva conosciuti diceva, quello è il tale, così bene vi erano state portate le somiglianze loro dal naturale: passò per proverbio finché la pittura stette in piedi, il dirsi per Firenze, gli è ritratto in S. Michele, e tanto basti. Era questo lavoro stato fatto da Matteo di “Roffello Pittore antico e civile.”</p>

<p>Ma tornando ai Capitani della Madonna di O. S. M. non debbo tralasciar di avvertire, come questi sono stati pure aboliti, avendo il Nostro Imperatore dara la soprintendenza del Sacro Tempio ad un solo Gentiluomo, il quale presentemente è ii Sig. Domenico Baldigiani. 
E per modo di appendice rammenterò quì la Ven. Congrega dei Preti detta della Visitazione, la quale riconosce il suo principio nel 1494. a dì 24. di Febbraio da alcuni Sacerdoti della Collegiata di Or S. Michele, e questa Congrega composta di 40 Preti senza più si aduna 
nella Chiesa di S. Michele in Palchetto, dove sulla porta leggesi il seguente titolo.</p>

<p>“CONGREGATIO VISITATIONIS PRESBYTERORVM.”</p>
