Vasari claims that this painting gained Botticelli much of his fame in Italy. The painting was commissioned by Gaspare di Zanobi della Lama, a powerful Florentine banker from the Guild of Moneychangers with ties to the Medici family. Gaspari shared his name with one of the three Magi that visits the newborn Christ child in this image, indicating the reason that the patron chose this subject for his chapel. However, the visit of the three Magi to the Christ child was already a popular scene in Florence as the Medici commonly commissioned representations of this scene. Cosimo de Medici and his two sons Piero and Giovanni assume the characters of the three Magi; Cosimo kneels in front of the Virgin, Piero appears in a red cloak at the center, and Giovanni kneels in white to Pieros right. The patron himself assumes the figure of the white-haired man amongst the group of figures on the right. Gaspare looks out at the viewer, as does the man on the far right who likely represents Botticellis self portrait. Bibliography Legouix, Susan. Botticelli. London: Chaucer Press, 2004. Pg. 53.

Painted sometime between 1396 and 1400, the scene depicts the somber moment before Christs betrayal and arrest. Christ kneels in prayer facing the silver chalice presented by an angel from Heaven. James, John, and Peter sleep in the foreground, failing to keep watch. To the left, a small lay donor with doffed cap genuflects in a way that replicates Christs pose, gazing upwards at the scene in intense prayer. A small lion makes it way down the path in the upper right, perhaps alluding to either the Evangelist St. Mark or to the commune of Florence, both of which were symbolized by a lion. In the predella, the artist included the two scenes that directly follow the Agony in the sequence of the Passion of Christ: the Arrest of Christ and the Stripping of Christ, whereby the standing victim is forced to shed his clothing before being nailed to the cross. This latter subject was depicted in the history of Italian art and stands as an anomaly that demands explanation. The brutal scenes of the Arrest and the Stripping serve as contrasts to the tranquility in the main panel above. The painting was moved to the Accademia museum in 1809 from its location in the monastery of Santa Maria degli Angeli, the former home of the artist, Lorenzo Monaco, and some have argued that the picture was intended to be seen in that space from the beginning. However, George Bent has hypothesized that the work was originally intended for a pilaster in Orsanmichele, the granary of Florence that was eventually converted into a church. Each of the major guilds owned a column there for which they commissioned works of art referencing their respective patron saints. Since St. Mark was the patron saint of the Linen Guild, and because the predella emphasizes the stripping of Christ at the crucifixion, it is possible that the guild officers commissioned this panel to represent them on its column in Orsanmichele. While the narrative sequence through the main panel and predella could suggest a possible function of an altarpiece, we can conclude from its unified compositional format that the piece was instead intended for a column.

        "content"  : "Baptistery of S. Giovanni, South Doors (1330-1336) Andrea Pisano The south portal of the Florentine Baptistery of S. Giovanni was originally adorned with a wooden door. In 1322 members of the Arte della Calimala, the Cloth Merchants Guild that was responsible for the buildings maintenance, upkeep, and decorations, moved to cover those doors with metal plates that they felt would act as a sign of the structures importance. By 1329 this approach was amended with a plan to make entirely new doors for the portal that would be made wholly of metal or brass. A goldsmith was sent to Pisa to study prototypes there, and by January of 1330 work was initiated on the Baptisterys south portal. Wax models were completed by April of that year, and in January of 1332 the casting of at least some of the twenty-eight panels began in earnest. The lengthy chasing process lasted from February 1333 until December 1335, and the entire ensemble was installed by June 20, 1336, just in time for the celebration of the Feast of St. John the Baptist, the patron saint of Florence, which was observed four days later. Andrea Pisano, who inscribed his name on one of the panels in 1330 (ANDREAS UGOLINI NINI DI PISIS ME FECIT A.D. MCCCXXX), seems to have been involved in this project from the very beginning. A promising sculptor who had trained as a goldsmith  a logical background for one eager to sculpt in metals, like bronze  Andrea had received the commission from the Arte della Calimala due to his earlier successes in Pisa, Siena, and Orvieto, where his work showed a clear adherence to the Gothic style then in vogue north of the Alps. In a way, his selection marked a departure from the Florentine norm, which emphasized a more classicizing approach to sculpture like that seen in the work of Arnolfo di Cambio, the architect and sculptor of the new cathedral of S. Maria del Fiore and the designer of the Franciscan church of S. Croce. The centralized compositions and large, volumetric masses of Arnolfo now gave way to the swaying draperies and elegantly elongated heroes in Andreas scenes. Neither the choice of John the Baptist as subject of this relief cycle nor the choice of the south portal as the setting for it comes as a surprise. The south doors faced the larger portion of the city center, and therefore was the front door of the Baptistery for most residents approaching the facility. Moreover, the south portal  perhaps because of their location as the front door of the building for most locals  was the place where much of the baptismal ritual was performed in the later Middle Ages. It made sense, then, to ornament this particular portal with images of the namesake of the Baptistery and the patron saint of the city, for this was the entrance seen and used by the greatest number of people in 1322 and beyond. Andreas design incorporates a number of geometric patterns and shapes into its overall design. As Anita Moskowitz has noted, the rectangular doors situated inside the large portal that penetrates the octagonal Baptistery serve to frame smaller hexagons, quatrefoils, and rhomboids that contain the scenes and figures within them. Within these framing devices appear twenty narrative scenes, beginning with the Annunciation to Zacharias(image) (Johns elderly father) and ending with the Burial of the Baptist(image), who was beheaded by King Herod at roughly the same time as the Crucifixion of Christ. At the doors base appear two rows of seated allegorical characters: the first shows each of the three Theological virtues (images) (Hope, Faith, and Charity) with an additional relief of Humility added for good measure, and, below it, a row depicting each of the four Cardinal virtues (images) (Fortitude, Temperance, Justice, and Prudence). The mixing of religious symbols with civic ones underscores the dual nature of Johns importance for the Florentines, who revered the saint both for his status as patron saint of the commune and for his role as the baptizer of Christ and his followers in the Bible. Throughout the ensemble, Andrea Pisano engages with the difficult parameters of the quatrefoil framing devices that enfold his compositions. Popular in French manuscript painting and stained glass designs from the thirteenth century, these lobed configurations do not always lend themselves easily to three-dimensional forms. At times, Andrea refrains from using the rounded corners of his frame at all, choosing instead to leave empty those areas that form the upper and lower boundaries: The Birth of the Baptist(image), for example, contains literally nothing inside the ultimately vacant upper registers of the composition. At other times, Andrea seems to work too hard to fill those zones, as he does with the seemingly gratuitous trees that pop up inexplicably on either side of the wilderness into which the youthful Baptist (image) strides. Still, his mastery of the complicated and temperamental medium of bronze casting shines through in each of these panels, as their pristine condition even today speaks of their high quality of craftsmanship. Andrea, while certainly inventive and highly creative in his approach to these scenes, had an obvious template in mind when he devised his twenty scenes of the life of John the Baptist. The monumental mosaic covering the Baptisterys ceiling, probably installed between 1275 and 1310 (at the very latest), includes in one of its horizontal bands the story of Florences patron saint, with many of the same scenes that later appear in the south doors relief panels. Both cycles include multiple scenes that take place at or outside the prison in Jerusalem in which the Baptist was held, and both sequences may well refer to the local custom whereby non-violent prisoners in Florentine jails were released annually on June 24  the Feast Day of St. John the Baptist. Although large effigies by Arnolfo di Cambio and Tina da Camaino were already installed on the cathedrals faade by 1336, Andrea Pisanos bronze reliefs were for almost one hundred years among the most highly prized images in the entire city.

        "content"  : "The Abandonment and Restitution of Children The Misericordia operated a kind of Foster Care unit inside its walls, and supported destitute families by tending to infants born into unstable environments. The hope was that these children would ultimately be reunited with their parents once affairs could be righted in the home, and sometimes this actually occurred. Often times it did not. The fresco on the buildings faade presents a moralizing image about the circumstances parents might find themselves in when seeking the Misericordias services and the custodial care offered by confraternity members. Led by a woman in white, a number of children appear in the lower left, holding opened pomegranates and moving toward the compositions center. A black-clad woman, an ominous reference to the sorrowful situation unfolding before her, points her finger into a circle formed by three others, one of whom holds a child in her arms. Another woman turns her back to us, revealing only the braided and unveiled hair than stretches down her back; perhaps signifying her as an unmarried and youthful woman. Her facelessness may be the artists way of providing anonymity to a sinful woman who now faces the consequences of her sexual transgressions, a way of acknowledging the presence of unwed mothers in Florentine society without actually identifying any one of them in particular. The Misericordias loggia features prominently at the paintings core as both the primary setting and, to a degree, the actual hero of this story. The child entering the facility from the left does so only under duress, and resists the confraternity member who forcibly grabs his arm to yank him inside. The frown on the mans face reveals and accentuates the real-life dramas that transpire at the Misericordia on a regular basis, as well as the emotional toll endured by all parties during these familial severances. This dramatic anecdote is framed by the loggia of the residence hall, which seems to act as a participant in the action that unfolds within its arches. Fortunately, the right side of the fresco tells a happier story. Now a trio of men  one of whom literally pushes a child out of the loggia  oversees the restitution of children with their elated parents. Women congregate before the doorway to the residence hall, which has been identified by Arnoldis half-length sculpture, installed in 1361, of the Madonna holding her own child (find the Madonna and Child). Whereas the left side features only women in the act of abandonment, the right side includes men, as well: we might wish to see them as fathers, but there is no way to confirm such an identification (they could be grandfathers, uncles, friends, or merely bystanders who witness this reunification). To the far left stands a woman in blue who acts as the counterweight to the one in black on the left side: she seems to serve as an allegory of the joy of familial reconciliation, as opposed to her scolding counterparts representation of the pains associated with abandonment. The frescos placement on the buildings faade  just above the setting that Gerini and Ambrogio di Baldese represented in this image, in fact  made it immediately visible to all passersby who walked along or stood at the south edge of the Baptistery of S. Giovanni. Chief among these viewers would have been the parents and family members of infants who witnessed the portion of the baptismal ceremony that was performed in front of S. Giovannis south portal. As such, the image probably had an immediate impact on new parents and their families: the Misericordia, it seemed to say, could help them in times of need, but that there would be emotional strains involved should they choose to render their children to the confraternitys care. It was, at one and the same time, both a somber warning and a gesture of great charity. Niccol di Pietro Gerini and Ambrogio di Baldese used the architectural structure of the Misericordia as a character in this fictitious narrative, but they also employed other features of the urban environment as markers for viewers of the fresco who stood below it in the middle of the square. The viewer has been intentionally positioned to see this fresco with her or his back to the baptistery, which of course explains why that octagonal form does not appear in the painting. To the far left appears the faade of the new cathedral, finally walled up in 1381 and ready to be capped with a dome that had not yet been designed. The square building next to it seems to represent the citys bell tower, articulated in pink with standing sculptures placed on top of it to recall the statues on the Campanile. A cluster of structures follows, perhaps representing the Palazzo del Podest, the square granary of Orsanmichele (complete with niches containing sculptures, which would have been an accurate sight in 1386), the crenelated residence of the Wool Guild, and a spiral column in front of it that may allude to the base of a pedestal that was positioned at the mouth of the Old Market. To the right of the loggia appears a regal palazzo, complete with two towers, that may mark it as the old Bishops palace. Alternatively, this pink structure might echo the form of S. Maria Maggiore, the church located to the west of the loggia. The artists have elongated this urban landscape and altered its features in an effort to plot out a pathway for viewers that they would understand. The city has been depicted not as a rational space, with vistas and dimensions and distances carefully mapped out, but rather as a series of independent landmarks easily identified by specific features that have no real relationship to the structures beside them. As Sonia Brozak notes, this conforms to the common approach that Trecento writers took when describing spaces in written texts. Dante and Boccaccio tended to take for granted their readers familiarity with urban environments and, when describing the settings of their tales, preferred to focus on specific landmarks in real places rather than review the vast cityscape in which those landmarks were located. The two painters worked together on a number of projects, but Gerini in particular became a favorite of Florentine patrons at the turn of the fifteenth century. His works adorned altars and interior spaces of the Confraternity of the Pilgrims in S. Maria Novella, the sacristy in the Franciscan church of S. Croce, the guild church of Orsanmichele, and the Camaldolese monastery of S. Maria degli Angeli. He also worked in the towns surrounding Florence in rural Tuscany, a testament to the extent of his reputation. Largely overlooked by historians of early Renaissance art, Gerinis popularity speaks to the public taste for Giottesque imagery just before the arrival in Florence of the transformative New Style of painting articulated in full by the artist named Masaccio (d. ca. 1427).

        "content"  : "Nardo di Cione, Last Judgment, ca. 1363 The wall just within the confines of the Bigallos loggia contains a now-damaged and detached fresco that probably illustrated the theme of the Last Judgment that artists like Nardo di Cione found so appealing during the fourteenth century (figure 1). The painting faced out toward the public from the chamber just inside the entrance, positioned on its west wall and facing east toward the Campanile that Andrea Pisano had recently ornamented with dozens of marble reliefs. The composition features the figure of Christ, who blesses viewers from his perch on a celestial cloudbank while holding in his left hand the open book emblazoned with the Alpha and Omega (the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, symbolic of the notion that Christ is the beginning and the ending of all things). Two pairs of angels flank him, some genuflecting with musical instruments in their hands and the others crossing their arms over their chests while gazing at their performing mates (figure 2). A constellation of gold stars covers what remains of the blue field below, damaged when the sculptural ensemble produced by Alberto Arnoldi was removed and relocated elsewhere in the Bigallo. Circumstantial evidence points toward Nardo as the artist responsible for the Last Judgment. Documents tell us that Nardo was paid to paint the ceiling vaults of the Bigallo in October, 1363 and that, at the time of his death two years later, he bequeathed to the institution a portion of his estate. Although neither archival reference pertains specifically to the wall on which the Last Judgment appears, scholars agree that Nardo was probably the author of the painting, and that the picture was most likely produced sometime in the early 1360s, at roughly the same time as Arnoldis Madonna and Child was sculpted for and installed in the loggia. The damage to this fresco obviously impedes our understanding and interpretation of it within the context of the Bigallos development as a charitable, social, and political institution. Certainly its subject matter made clear the spiritual qualities to which the Company of the Misericordia aspired, while the rather fierce representation of the uncompromising Christ figure must have injected into this setting  and projected onto the street where passersby could see it  a severe reminder of the fleetingness of time and the certainty of judgment at the End of Days. For precisely these reasons the Last Judgment was the perfect image for a confraternity eager to coax new members (and deep-pocketed donors) into its midst, for this reminder of the importance the Christian faith placed on works of charity was more than a subtle hint that this was a place worth supporting.

        "content"  : "In 1321, a wealthy magnate named Baldinaccio Adimari gifted property that he owned in his familys neighborhood to a newly formed charitable organization charged with the tasks of tending to the destitute, diseased, and disenfranchised. The building there housed the Misericordia from that time forward but, thanks to a series of additional gifts from neighbors, the company was able to expand its residence to the east and the west. Giovanni degli Albizzi Pellegrini, a member of one of the citys most powerful families, donated property adjacent to the original building in 1351, and in 1355 the addition of the twenty feet at the corner of the Corso Adimari provided the company with the area needed for the loggia that now extended to the east. From 1355 to 1360, a man named Leonardo Bartolini oversaw the construction of this loggia, which included work completed by a number of skilled laborers he subcontracted to produce details according to their areas of expertise: One Francesco Salvini received 13 gold florins for undisclosed work, while a painter named Bartolommeo earned the equivalent of 21 gold florins for his decoration of the top of the oratory  presumably its ceiling, but perhaps the walls of the upper floor of the residence. In 1363 the project was deemed complete when the so-called Ambrogio installed elaborate decorative ironwork, priced at 100 florins (but no more than that!), on the loggias western and northern arches. Although more modest in scale than some of Florences other loggias, the intimate proportions and delicate decorations of this elegant monument make the Misericordias structure one of the most beautiful in the city. Ambrogios iron grill alone distinguishes it from other such edifices in Florence, but its easy to overlook it when taking in the entirety of the building for the first time. The marble exterior forms two sides of the loggias square box, with openings on the east and north sides providing visual access to the interior. Green marble, a decorative motif borrowed from the eleventh-century facings of the Baptistery and S. Miniato, provides a subtle articulation that frames the two arches, their pendentives, and the horizontal borders at the top and bottom. Column clusters form the discrete sections of each pier and serve as supports for the loggias arches, and then spring upward toward the quadripartite vault that flowers into porchs ceiling. Twisting columns, perhaps allusions to the spiral ones said to have once adorned the interior of King Solomons temple in Jerusalem, create the illusion of movement as ones eye moves toward the interior. Foliage and rosette patterns dance across the surface of the entire white marble structure, making the loggia appear as an avant-garde welcoming center to all comers. This sense is only intensified by the figurative sculptures that decorate the faade. Within the green strips that create sections across the loggias surface appear a series of modest bas-reliefs  perhaps carved by Arnolfo Arnoldi, under the influence of Andrea Pisano  that contain in them a set of undifferentiated heavenly figures who tilt their heads back to consider images of Christ at the apex of each arch. The quatrefoil frames on the east arch contain scroll-bearing prophets from the Old Testament who flank the half-length form of the Dead Christ  the so-called Man of Sorrows  while those on the north arch feature saints from the New Testament and the Early Christian church who receive a blessing from an image of the Resurrected Christ above them. Representatives from both books of the Bible here recognize Jesus as Savior. Triangular spandrels on either side of each arch contain half-length figures of the four Cardinal Virtues: Temperance and Prudence appear above the rounded vault on loggias the east side, while Justice and Fortitude decorate that on the north. These same characters appear in Nardo di Ciones lunette fresco of The Judgment of Brutus from the middle of the 1340s that decorated the main room of the Florentine Wool Guild, just down the street, on the way to the Ponte Vecchio. The concepts that guide wise decisions and just behaviors in and in front of the Misericordia have been paired with Judeo-Christian heroes whose exemplary lives and influential texts combine to form the experiential and codified bases for fourteenth-century moral codes. The very form of the public loggia carried some symbolic importance in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Often installed for pragmatic purposes  namely to provide the public with a form of protection from soaking rains or the intense Italian sun  the loggia came to be understood as a civic structure that, even when built by private citizens, was a gift to the commune at large. For example, the Loggia dei Lenzi, situated adjacent to the Palazzo della Signoria, gave the governmental piazza an architectonic emblem of democracy, as its form, location, and function suggested an accessibility to literally anyone who wished to venture inside it. Giovanni Rucellais loggia, placed opposite his palace in the middle of the fifteenth century on the occasion of his sons marriage to Cosimo deMedicis daughter, heightened the owners sense of self-importance as he simultaneously celebrated his prominence in the city as a Medici kinsman and his role as a public servant through this donation of an architectural structure to the residents of Florence. In keeping with this signification, the loggia for the Misericordia was both a symbol of the charitable nature of the institution  both the building and the services rendered inside it were gifts to the city  and a symbol of the companys prominence in the urban environment  it was made of expensive materials, followed long-standing Florentine design traditions, and sat on prime real estate in one of the citys most important squares. Early painters of Florentine cityscapes occasionally included representations of the loggia when producing vistas of the Piazza S. Giovanni, although their renditions differed from artist to artist and from painting to painting. The building features prominently in the fresco by Niccol di Pietro Gerini and Ambrogio di Baldese that originally decorated the faade of the residence hall that faced the Baptistery, and portrayed its appearance with impressive accuracy. These artists included in their painting of 1386 the column clusters, iron grates, spandrel figures, and the rosette decoration that forms the left side of the loggias entrance that mark it as such a remarkable space, suggesting that the buildings details truly mattered to both the frescos painters and its audience. Ridolfo Ghirlandaio, by contrast, painted in 1515 a much more simplified version of the space in his predella for the Bigallo altarpiece (with figures by Alberto Arnoldi installed in 1364): the sixteenth-century artist emphasized rectilinear pilasters (rather than sculpted column clusters and spiral colonnettes) as supports for the arches, avoided the articulation of each bas-relief, and omitted the figures of the Cardinal Virtues that were sculpted in the spandrels. Even though he truncated the residence in his painting  he shows only two arched bays on the north faade instead of three  he was careful to include iron bars within the archway and the rosette plinth at its base. The late sixteenth-century aerial view of Piazza S. Giovanni by either Giorgio Vasari or the Flemish painter Jan van der Straet (a.k.a. Giovanni Stradano, a.k.a. Johannes Stradanus, d. 1605) references the loggia only through the pictorial employment of rounded arches that mark the facility as distinct from those around it, but then fails entirely to capture even a semblance of its actual appearance beyond these obvious rounded vaults. Fabio Borbottoni (d. 1902) reproduced the loggias architectural features with some accuracy when he painted his version in the late nineteenth century, but he omitted completely the sculptural elements embedded in the archways: its as though they were never installed on the buildings faade at all. Notes 1363, 24 June. The captains directed the administrator to pay the painter, Bartolommeo, 62 lire, 4 sold, and 6 denari for pictures at the head of the oratory (see carte 37). 1363, 24 October.

        "content"  : "Madonna and Child with Angels Representations and effigies of all shapes, sizes, and media could adorn the early modern altarpiece, a devotional object that was placed on top of the table where the sacraments of the Eucharist were venerated and consumed by priests. Usually the altarpiece took the form of a wooden painting that featured, up to about 1440 or so, separate panels dedicated to single figures or scenes. The central panel often, but not always, represented the Virgin and Child, while flanking panels celebrated an institutions reverence for specific saints who might represent the patron of a religious order, parish, feast day, or individual benefactor. Above and below these large forms often appeared smaller pictures dedicated to narrative scenes, often representing moments from the life or lives of those saints occupying the larger panels above. Arnoldis ensemble is that rare structure that both embraces and defies tradition. The three-dimensional forms have been arranged in a way that recalls the format of a painted altarpiece, with the central characters of Christ and the Madonna appropriately elevated above those who flank them. But Arnoldi, abiding by the requirements of his contract, sculpted two angels instead of saints to flank the Virgin, a distinct departure from the appearance of most Trecento altarpieces. Moreover, Arnoldi did not carve any bas-relief narrative scenes below these large statues in a way the might mimic a strip of predella panels placed at the base of an altarpiece. (this would be remedied only in the sixteenth century by Ridolfo Ghirlandaio, who painted images of charitable scenes from the Bible that were added to Arnoldis altarpiece in 1515). As a result, the ensemble originally appeared as a group of standing figures perched on a platform above the altarpiece in a grouping not unlike the one devised by Giovanni Pisano for the Scrovegni Chapel in the distant city of Padua in 1305. This may explain why, in the records of deliberations concerning Arnoldis commission, the captains of the Misericordia mentioned the sculptors of Pisa as the qualitative bar by which the local artists works would be judged. Arnoldis figures bear close resemblance to sculpted images produced in Florence during the first half of the fourteenth century. Despite being hidden by draperies that pull across her torso and sweep from left hip to right foot, Marys body seems proportionally accurate and naturalistically balanced thanks to a contrapposto pose formed by her flexed right knee and straight, weight-bearing left leg. The hefty Christ child, perched on his mothers bent left arm, raises his right hand to her neck in a gesture of intimacy that contrasts with the more didactic presentation of the small crucifix that he holds in his left. The two angels hold candelabra that appear as columns and turn their heads (attenuated on top of rather slender and elongated necks) inward toward the holy couple. The chubby cheeks of Christ and the volumetric bodies of all four figures suggests the influence of Arnolfo di Cambio, whose marble figures on the faade of the nearby Duomo had been in place since the first decade of the century. But the craned necks and heads of the angels, combined with the swaying hips of the Virgin, recall the more Gothicized work of Giovanni and Andrea Pisano, the latter of whom was active in Florence during the decade of the 1330s. In fact, these visual recollections of the work of earlier Pisan artists confused later critics of Italian sculpture. In his famous sixteenth-century study of Italian art and architecture (the famous Lives of the Artists), Giorgio Vasari erroneously attributed Arnoldis figures to Andrea Pisano and his assistant, Ciognara, perhaps due to their participation in the sculptural project to cast bronze reliefs on the south doors of the Baptistery that face the Misericordias residence from the middle of the piazza. His mistake is understandable due precisely to Arnoldis intentional employment of the Gothicized approach to sculpture that his patrons, the captains of the Misericordia, demanded from him.

See Passarini, 93-94, note 2, who cites the source of these documents as A.S.F., Bigallo, II, Deliberazioni dei Capitani II. 1359, Action 15, 18th day of June: Filippo di Bartolo Filippi, Rusticho Donati, Filippo del Nero, Davanzato Iohanni (Davanzati), Giovanni di Firenze, and Francesco di Pero captains of this confraternity, in their name and on behalf of their compatriots, deliberated on the following things: First, they agreed to offer to Alberto Arnoldi, master from the parish of San Michele Berteldi, the commission to produce an image in marble of Our Lady holding her Son in her arms in an act of mercy, decorated and adorned in gold and lustrous colors as is appropriate, with two angels: the Madonna should be at least three braccie tall (roughly 1.5 meters) and the two angels at least two and half braccie tall (roughly 1.25 meters). All of these figures must be by the hand of Alberto, who shall receive a salary of 150 florins for the figure of our Lady and 130 florins for the two angels, who should be holding candles in their hands: the figure of Mary should be of a higher quality than the figure of Our Lady in Pisa. Its quality will be judged by three or four masters deemed to be qualified by the city of Florence, which shall appoint them at the time. And if it is deemed to be inferior to the one in Pisa, the Bigallo will not be obligated to keep it. And the images of the marble angels must be of the same quality and beauty of the said figure of Mary. He will be paid in the following manner: he will recieve an initial payment of one hundred gold florins, and when the figure of Our Lady has been completed to our satisfaction he will have fifty gold florins, and when he has purchased the marble for the angels he will receive fifty gold florins to cover the cost of materials; he will compose and install in the oratory the figures at his own expense. And the figures will be completed in two years from the time of their initiation, as indicated by the date of the first payment of one hundred florins. See the statement notarized by Ser Tino (aforementioned book, carte 12). 1364, 16 August. They met and absolved the master Alberto Arnoldi and his son, Alesso, of wrongdoing in the production of the figures of Our Lady and angels, and they declared him to be in accord with the agreement made, and they asked me to check the contract and all the agreements, which I annulled and canceled (see carte 57).",

        "content"  : "Madonna and Child Arnoldis Madonna and Child conforms to the half-length form popular at the time. The Virgins swung hip supports the Christ child in her left arm, while her right hand clutches both her own breast and the boys fingers. The two figures incline their heads toward one another while their halos intersect and overlap. A series of parallel forms  Marys right forearm and Christs legs, Jesuss back and the Madonnas right bicep, Marys left hand and her sons tilted head  leads our eye in a gothic zigzag across the surface that culminates at the compositions apex where the two heads nearly touch. The glazed background and pointed arch suggest that these figures reside in a celestial zone both above and within the Piazza S. Giovanni: they occupy the heavenly realm in perpetuity but simultaneously preside over the citizens of Florence while protecting the institution of the Misericordia (including both its members and those who take advantage of its services) at all times. Installed above the heads of visitors to the residence hall and positioned in the doorway that led directly to the oratory where Arnoldis figures on the Misericordias altarpiece stood, the Madonna and Child prepared lay Florentines for the experience they were about to have inside the place where mothers and their children were either separated from each other or reunited after a period of estrangement. The appearance of the Holy Family at this important, limnal juncture between the public space of the city (in the form of the piazza) and the private space of the Misericordia surely offered to viewers of all genders, ages, and vocations a sense of the services rendered by the company as well as the quality of care its members promised to provide for the children offered to it by families in need. As such, the intimacy between Arnoldis figures seems both tender and anguished, for some of those who entered into the residence hall from this portal could not have been happy about the transaction that was about to occur. Images of Mary were predictably popular in domestic settings, where women of all ages and stations recognized her as a symbol of matronly love. Her placement above the front entrance of the citys best-known Foster Care center must have made her particularly appealing to those Tuscan women who, when approaching the confraternity in their time of need, may have been reminded that the Virgin had given birth out of wedlock and probably well before her twentieth birthday. She was a sympathetic and completely appropriate patron for the confraternity of the Misericordia.

The scene takes place on a coast surrounded by trees and hills of dark green and brown. Venus, Greek goddess of love and beauty, appears on a scallop shell in a contrapposto stance. Her weight shifts gracefully onto her left leg, and her hips respond accordingly. Her golden hair curves with her body and blows in the breeze, which comes from the breath of Zephyr to the left. At the left of the composition, Zephyr grasps onto Chloris, and pink roses surround them. According to Classical mythology, the birth of roses came along with the birth of the goddess of love and beauty. A nymph dressed in a floral robe welcomes Venus with a pink floral cloak that moves with the wind. The scene should be read as a Neoplatonic allegory for beauty and perfection, featuring the virtue of Venus at the center. These Neoplatonic themes would have been discussed within the Medici court in Quattrocento Florence. Bibliography Legouix, Susan. Botticelli. London: Chaucer Press, 2004. Pg. 118. Lightbown, Ronald.

        "content"  : "Orcagna Expulsion of the Duke of Athens (1343) The fresco of the Expulsion of the Duke of Athens was originally painted for the infamous Florentine debtors prison called the Stinche, located east of the Palazzo del Podest. The name of the prison refers to the name of a castle in the mountains where a family of Ghibelline supporters resided. Debt was considered a major crime in early capitalist Italy, and being thrown in the Stinche designated an inmate as being a treacherous enemy of the comune. Thus, it is fitting that this fresco designed for the Stinche depicted a notorious threat to Florentine Republicanism: Walter of Brienne VI, also known as the Duke of Athens. When Walter had arrived in Florence in 1342, the upper-middle class guild members who controlled the Florentine government expected him to preserve their power. However, the Duke ended up losing the support of the wealthy and commoners alike because of his insistence on raising taxes and acting as a despot. Notably, Walter angered members of the powerful Wool Guild by permitting lower class laborers to separate from the organization and form their own guild. The Florentine citizens finally managed to expel Walter on 6 August 1343, the Feast Day of St. Anne. Scholars are unsure of the frescos artist, but most agree that the work was completed either by Orcagna or his master, Bernardo Daddi. The Expulsion of the Duke of Athens illustrates Walter turning his back towards the representation of the Palazzo della Signoria, the seat of the Florentine government. St. Anne, whose feast day on August 6 coincided with this rebellion, occupies the space to the left of the Palazzo, and to her right appear soldiers who await Annes order to expel the duke from the city. At Walters feet lie the emblems of justice that had been neglected through his rule, including the scales of justice and a book of law. The similarities between this composition and other Judgment images in Tuscany are notable. In this allegorical image representing the communes intolerance for traitors, St. Anne acts as the stand-in for Florence, and the city of Florence, represented by the Palazzo della Signoria, becomes the judge. Saint Anne gestures to her right towards the Florentine citizens, who could be considered the saved, typically placed to the right of Christ in Last Judgment scenes. St. Anne gestures to her left towards the damned, which in this case is embodied by the disgraced Duke of Athens. Thus, the painting simultaneously acts as an illustration of a specific event and as an allegory for St. Annes role in helping the citizens banish a traitor from the city. The image conforms to a type of painting called pitture infamanti, or infamous pictures, which proved to be a powerful way to punish criminals and warn others from committing the same crimes against the comune. Pitture infamanti punished criminals by representing them in a humiliating way that would be recognizable to viewers; these now-lost paintings were often attached to the sides of public buildings in order to be visible to the entire cities, and they often included degrading symbolic attributes of the criminal. Criminals who betrayed the public trust would be humiliated through these types of images, and their reputations would suffer. While we are not entirely sure of this paintings function within the Stinche, scholars are fairly certain that the image was located near the entrance on the inside of the prison and would have been seen by both prisoners and people visiting inmates. Notably, debtors could be expelled from Florence during this time, so prisoners and their friends and family had to contemplate this possibility while viewing this scene. Bibliography Bent, George.

        "content"  : "Nardo di Cione (?), The Judgment of Brutus, ca. 1345 Dante Society (ex-Palazzo del Arte della Lana, Sala dUdienza) The lunette fresco of The Judgment of Brutus has received practically no serious attention from students of Florentine art and history, yet it is one of the more interesting pictures of the mid-fourteenth century (figure 1). Produced for the Sala dUdienza, or Audience Hall, of the headquarters for the Arte della Lana probably sometime in the middle of the 1340s, the allegorical painting was originally adorned with a series of inscriptions on scrolls that made clear the identities of each figure. We know that the central character, seated on a bench, represents the First Consul of Rome, Junius Brutus, famous for his wisdom and staunch defense of Republicanism in the face of tyranny. Not to be confused with his more infamous descendent (the assassin of Julius Caesar), Junius Brutus led the uprising in 709 BCE that resulted in the dismantling of Romes decadent monarchy and the creation of a Republican government that fourteenth-century Florentines took as the predecessor of their own. It comes as no surprise, then, that the paintings composition, attributed recently to Nardo di Cione, follows closely the groundbreaking template produced by Ambrogio Lorenzetti for his equally political picture, the Allegory of Good Government, completed in 1338 for the Room of the Nine inside Sienas Palazzo Pubblico. In the Wool Guilds painting, the four Cardinal Virtues of Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, and Temperance  all of them depicted as women, as was the custom  flank the seated judge, forming a kind of buffer so that the two pairs of finely dressed male petitioners cannot get too close to him. The men spit bitter accusations and threats at the Virtues and, through them, at Junius Brutus: they have axes to grind and wish to make clear that the wisdom of Brutus is not to their liking. The Virtues, by contrast, defend Brutus actions and dare the petitioners to follow through on their threats. They will not be cowed by the aggressions of self-important, but ultimately petty, complainants. To the lower right, however, we see a different exchange, and one that seems to catch the eye of Junius Brutus (who looks down in that direction). There we see Temperance engage with a seemingly deferential man, who actually pulls away from the Virtue: she urges him to approach the judge and guarantees that he will receive a fair hearing as long as he shows some respect. The man, in turn, humbly acknowledges his own shortcomings and worries that he is not worthy of Brutus attentions  when, in fact, he clearly is the ONLY one among the group of four men who merits a hearing. The paintings message seems clear to any member of the Wool Guild who might have gazed upon it while waiting his or her turn to file a grievance or receive judgment from its consuls. The rule of law, it says, must be acknowledged; judges must be respected; and all those who appear before it with the proper attitude will be welcomed before the court. But, of course, it also illustrates clearly that those who oppose that court and its commitment to objective jurisprudence will be met with the wrath of its administrators. The timing of the frescos production, arguably initiated and completed during the middle years of the 1340s, corresponds to a major crisis that threatened the status quo of the Florence Republic. In the spring of 1343, Walter of Brienne, the Duke of Athens, permitted wool-workers normally excluded from the Arte della Lana to form their own guild, which in turn threatened the economic potency of the Wool Guild and the stability of a city that had traditionally relegated laborers to positions of inferiority with respect to their mercantile superiors. Walters ouster that summer was directly connected to this move, demonstrating both the depth of the Wool Guilds concern over this matter and the power it wielded across the city. When the Duke of Athens fled into exile in August, 1343, the woolworkers trade association that he had supported was quickly dismantled and its members were either folded back into the Wool Guild in subordinate roles or were disenfranchised altogether. However, simmering animosities lingered. Some of these now-disenfranchised laborers wished to revive the guild that had been demolished by the wool merchants, and cells of malcontents were formed in 1344 to plot some kind of revival of the corporation that had been taken from them. These movements, when discovered, were suppressed quickly and mercilessly: ringleaders were arrested on charges of treason and sedition, tried within 72 hours, and hanged shortly thereafter. It is in the context of these bitter arguments that the Judgment of Brutus must be considered, for the will of the guild  expressed through the positioning of the Roman judge and his virtuous guardians  is here celebrated as omnipotent, merciful, and benevolent: precisely the things that many of those on the outside believed it wasnt. In a very real sense, then, the Judgment of Brutus is a picture of pure political and economic propaganda. It attempted both to teach and to control viewers who saw it during times of controversy in the Audience Hall of the Arte della Lana, but did so by promoting itself in ways that, in part, defied credulity.

Her eyes are closed, and St. John the Evangelist supports her body as she expresses her sadness. The Three Marys surround the Virgin and Christ, with Mary Magdalene clutching Christs limp feet. Botticelli used a relatively muted color palette for this piece, likely to emphasize the solemnity of the subject.

        "content"  : "Magdalene Chapel Frescoes Built between 1316 and 1322, the Magdalene Chapel served as a holding space in the Bargello Palace, where those convicted of serious crimes received their last rites and awaited execution. Also referred to as the Cappella del Podest, the chapel is located in the northeast corner of the first floor of the ancient civic building. The walls of the chapel were decorated with vibrant frescoes of the Afterlife, discovered under a coat of whitewash in 1840 and immediately attributed to the hand of Giotto after a controversial restoration project added touch-ups to confirm such an attribution. Painted sometime between 1322 and 1337, the cycle features the remnants of what must have been a vivid scene of Hell on the entrance wall and an image of Christ Enthroned in the Celestial Court on the altar wall opposite it. Lateral walls linking the two contain scenes from the lives of John the Baptist and Mary Magdalene, respectively. One striking feature within the chapel is the apparent absence of a Last Judgment scene, despite the dual representations of Heaven and Hell on opposite sides of the room. This absence may have been due to the chapels function as a penal site and the intended viewership of this cycle. Condemned criminals spent their final hours in the chapel after receiving their sentence from a court tribunal, and during their final moments on Earth were invited to decide which fate to embrace for the duration of eternity. To assist them in this process, members of the Arch-confraternity of Santa Maria della Croce al Tempio joined them in the chapel and attended to their spiritual and physical needs as they accepted their confessions. Surely, some conversations about the penance of the Magdalene and the Baptists decapitation must have occurred while gazing up at the frescoes that illustrated the lives and deaths of those canonized Christian heroes. The lay brothers then assisted the condemned during the procession through Florentine streets to the gallows beyond the church of S. Croce, offering words of solace and invitations for repentance along the way as the executioner awaited their arrival. The iconography of the Magdalene Chapel was inspired by the function of the space. Having been judged by the commune, the condemned entered the chapel to receive his (or, occasionally, her) last rites and contemplate the fate of their souls, with the options of Heaven and Hell displayed upon the walls. A portrait once believed to be of the famous Italian poet Dante can be seen standing among the figures of Heaven. The North wall of the chapel retains only two of the original scenes from the life of John the Baptist, The Naming of the Baptist and The Feast of Herod. If the cycle was based on the mosaic in the south end of the Baptisterys ceiling, it may have included an image of Johns imprisonment or his beheading, or both. As the patron saint of Florence, his presence in the Magdalene chapel marked the civic space as a zone protected by its holy advocate, but also reminded the condemned that the Baptist, too, had been executed for his crime. Mary Magdalenes life cycle, covering the South wall of the chapel and extending to the North wall, also referred to the themes of vice, penance, and redemption, albeit in a much less violent way than seen in the cycle of the Baptist. As the patron saint of sinners, the cycle of her repentance and subsequent salvation set an example upon the walls of the chapel for every sinner who entered the chapel for their last rites.

        "content"  : "Andrea di Cione and Jacopo di Cione, St. Matthew, 1369 Uffizi Galleries (ex-Orsanmichele, south pier) The guilds of Florence agreed in 1336 to place effigies of their patron saints inside and outside the centrally located edifice of Orsanmichele, the grain distribution center that became a church in the middle of the fourteenth century. Only a few of them actually did so, and one of those was the Bankers guild, or Arte del Cambio. In 1367 the elderly painter Andrea di Cione, called Orcagna, received the commission to produce a painting of St. Matthew with four narrative panels flanking the central figure of the standing evangelist (see figure 1). Orcagna ingeniously altered the typical triptych format commonly used by artists when producing devotional pictures so that the side panels folded backwards, rather than forwards over the central compartment, to allow it to fit around the contours of a pier that supported one of the open loggias on the south wall of the building. But Orcagna would not live long enough to see the project through to completion, and his much younger brother, Jacopo, was called upon to finish the job when Orcagna died in 1368. Exactly who painted what has remained an open question, as the features of the figures in all five zones retain a certain consistency of form. Matthew stands in a typically Orcagnesque frontal pose, with a stylus in his right hand and an open book in his left (see figure 2). The figures furrowed brow, high cheekbones, and finely painted hair (and whiskers!) recall the stern Christ figure in Andreas Strozzi Altarpiece for the church of S. Maria Novella from 1357. The pink robe that surrounds Matthews blue garment fits loosely around his torso and arms, and then falls in diagonal folds from the upper left to the lower right, another feature common in Andreas oeuvre. But theres a kind of dullness about the figure that does not correspond precisely to an autograph work by Orcagna, and that gives specialists a certain pause when evaluating the painting. A compelling interpretation is that Orcagna designed the image and got as far as roughly out the compositions, but that Jacopo then took up the project upon his brothers death in 1368 and did the actual painting of the triptych. Similarly, the four flanking narrative panels, each one dedicated to an important scene from the life of St. Matthew, reveal a painterly approach consistent with works by Orcagna, but an execution that seems less favorable by comparison (see figures 3 and 4). The facial figures of the bearded characters, particularly the areas between the nose and the end of the beard, slope outward at an angle inconsistent with the work of Orcagna but well within the norm for later paintings known to have been produced by Jacopo. These scenes were probably painted by the younger artist and then submitted to the Guild of the Doctors and Apothecaries as evidence of his skill when he applied for admittance to that body in 1369. Oddly, the story reads from the lower left to the upper left, and then moves across the central compartment to the upper right before dropping down to lower right. In the first scene, Christ Calling St. Matthew, we see Jesus beckoning to Matthew, a money-changer who thus complicit with the Romans in their control of Palestine, who in turn accepts the invitation to follow. Behind Matthew we see a bench with a boy guarding a safebox, all references to contemporary practices of customer service in fourteenth-century Florence. The event illustrated here shows us the life of wealth and ease Matthew chose to surrender when he accepted Christs call of discipleship. The scene above bears the image of Matthew Quelling Dragons, a fairly typical allegorical description of a saints ability to quiet the fury of sin or the presence of evil. Matthew and John the Evangelist (clean-shaven and youthful as always), armed with the truth of the books they hold in their arms, calm the threatening beasts while their masters remark upon the sudden impotence of their usually impressive weapons. The Gospels here defeat heresy not with power or might, but rather with the truth of the word. The upper right panel depicts Matthew, joined again by the beardless John, reviving a dead boy, who sits upright on his funeral bier. To the left we see the infidel marvel at the active power of Gods word: they tilt their heads toward each other, gesture toward the resurrected child, and lift their hands in the air in surprise and dismay. Just as the upper scene across from it on the left side features the quieting of a pair of heretics, so too does this vignette emphasize the defeat of the enemies of Orthodoxy by the righteousness of One True Way. In the final panel we see the martyrdom of Matthew, as the saint falls victim to an assassins blade while kneeling before an altar that has been partnered intentionally with the bankers bench of his previous lifes work on the opposite side of the triptych. As with the pairing of scenes above, we again see our artists intentionally pairing up themes to emphasize a particular message: in this case, we encounter a protagonists spiritual development over a period of time. Matthew, who was once a money-changer working from a secular table in a bank, became a follower of Christ and was killed in front of a spiritual table in a church. The connection works well and shows this fundamentally important member of the banking trade as an honorable and godly man. One assumes the members of the Florentine Bankers Guild wished to be seen in the same light. All the same, one cannot overlook the rather strange underlying message that these scenes present. Although Matthew was a banker, and although the Bankers Guild commissioned the work (which has been made clear by the addition of four roundels of gold coins on a red field that have been placed on either side of each flanking panels gable), the actual profession of money-changing does not necessarily come off in a good light. Indeed, we are informed that Matthew attains the Kingdom of Heaven in spite of his secular profession rather than because of it, and the Cione brothers seem to encourage members of the Florentine Arte del Cambio to turn their backs on such financial endeavors in order to focus on spiritual ones. Such is the dual and sometimes contradictory nature of religious painting in an early capitalistic society in which its most successful practitioners that worried constantly and openly about the implications of making too much money during ones earthly existence. It troubled them greatly every time they heard a preacher remind them that it was easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it was for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of Heaven. When, in 1369, the painting was finally installed in Orsanmichele, Jacopo di Cione submitted his portion of the painting to the Arte dei Medici e Speziali as a presentation piece by which his skills could be evaluated in anticipation of entry into the guild. At that time the picture faced the nearby tabernacle that Orcagna had completed only ten years earlier, as well as Bernardo Daddis miracle-working dossal of the Madonna del Orsanmichele inside it (figure 5). In a way, the single panel of Matthew and the narrative images next to it formed a sort of detached polyptych when see in tandem with the Madonna and the other pier panels and frescoes the surrounded it. Along with Giovanni del Biondos St. John the Evangelist (figure 6) and a number of other panel paintings of patron saints just like it, the image of St. Matthew injected a sense of pictorial elegance and gold-encrusted spirituality to the new church of Orsanmichele that now stood in place of the former grain distribution center of Florence.

        "content"  : "Andrea di Cione, Baldacchino, 1352-59 Orsanmichele Framing magnificently the famed miracle-working Madonna of Orsanmichele by Bernardo Daddi, Andrea di Ciones Baldacchino articulated perfectly the mid-Trecento aesthetic that appealed to Florentine audiences of the day. A massive structure, carved in marble with sections of inlaid gold and mosaic tesserae sprinkled throughout, the tabernacle both framed the picture that, in 1365, was named the official painting of Florence and stood on its own as a cultural curiosity that brought in local and international viewers in droves (figure 1). Andrea di Cione, or Orcagna as he was known to contemporaries, received the commission to sculpt this absolutely massive ensemble in 1352, some four years after the passing of the Black Death. The commission to replace the previous tabernacle that had stood since the second decade of the century may have been initiated by the Captains of the Confraternity of Orsanmichele as a response to the extensive criticism it had just received for the way in which they handled and then spent the windfall of profits the institution had just accepted after the wills of thousands of Florentine plague victims were opened and their bequests distributed all at the same time. Matteo Villani, in his Chronicle of Florence, vehemently condemned the captains, accusing them of embezzlement and condemning them for their selfishness. Orcagna received his commission shortly thereafter. Orcagna designed the tabernacle as an architectonic edifice that approximates the loggia form used so frequently by confraternities across the city. A two-tiered grate surrounds the square loggia on all four sides, with each corner articulated by similarly twisted column clusters that form hefty piers from which spring the ribs of the vault (figure 2). The rounded arches provide sightlines for the miraculous painting on three sides. Pinnacles and pediments extend toward the ceiling, and serve to partially conceal a ribbed dome that may well symbolize the heavens above. Book-wielding evangelists and angels stand on these piers and columns to assert the textual and spiritual authority of the Virgin Mary. The pedestal upon which this loggia sits has been adorned with a series of relief panels dedicated to scenes from the Life of the Virgin Mary, an appropriate subject given the presence of the painted miracle-working Madonna in the middle of the tabernacle. Among them appear the Birth of the Virgin, the Education of the Mary, the Annunciation, the Presentation of Christ, and the Dormition and Assumption of the Virgin, all of which demonstrate a similar approach to spatial flatness, volumetric mass, and gestural message. Circling up and around the actual picture appear sets of angels who pull back a marble curtain in a manner that probably replicates the solemn ritual that was performed every time the Madonna was unveiled for privileged viewers, whereby an actual curtain was lifted up by custodians who were seated inside the back of the tabernacle, pulling on ropes unseen by those standing in the church. Increasingly during the fourteenth century, these visitors tended to be non-Florentines of high standing, as the previously open arches along the sides of the building in which the tabernacle was located were gradually walled up and the miraculous image inside was covered for its own protection. Orcagnas tabernacle received great acclaim almost as soon as it was completed. Only months after its installation in 1359, the artist was offered the position of Master of the Cathedral by the canons of the Duomo in the papal retreat town of Orvieto, about halfway between Florence and Rome: that endeavor lasted roughly three years, and by 1362 Orcagna was back in Florence, where he soon accepted the commission to produce a painted effigy of St. Matthew for the Arte del Cambio, or Bankers Guild, of Florence. The decision to name the miracle-working picture inside it as the official painting of the city seems to have motivated, in part, by the sumptuous sculptural loggia that Orcagna had built around it. And when Stefano Marchioni wrote his chronicle of the city in 1377, Orcagnas s Baldacchino was the only work of art that the author bothered to mention, thus prioritizing this sculpture over the paintings by Giotto, the reliefs by Andrea Pisano, and the architecture of Arnolfo di Cambio as the image of primacy in a city filled with other logical candidates.

Wind god Zephyr appears at the right and seizes the nymph Chloris, who transforms into Flora - nymph of Springtime - through the tendrils that extend from her mouth and metamorphosize into the floral garment next to her. The tall, slender, golden-haired Graces to the left of Venus exude an elegance that was admired in quattrocento Florence. They dance gracefully in diaphanous robes that move with the summer wind. At the very left of the composition, Mercury, often associated with Venus in ancient mythology, faces away from the scene and reaches toward the sky with a caduceus to stir the rain clouds of Autumn. Although we dont know the original setting or patron for the work, we know that Botticelli has employed Neoplatonic themes from the Ovidian myth of metamorphosis that would have been discussed at the Medici court.

Despite its location in the midst of laborers engaged in the messy, dangerous, and thankless work of wool production, the friary catered to the spiritual interests and needs of some of the citys wealthiest elites. Like the building history of S. Maria Novella, its rival counterpart to the west, S. Croces church and dependencies evolved steadily through the fourteenth century. Burial chapels in the transept were secured by families like the Bardi, Peruzzi, Baroncelli, and Castellani families, some of the most powerful and privileged in all of Florence. In keeping with their status, the citys finest artists were commissioned to produce mural and panel decorations there: Giotto, Taddeo Gaddi, and Maso di Banco worked there in the first half of the Trecento, while Giovanni da Milano, Angolo Gaddi, and Niccol di Pietro Gerini painted frescoes there between 1365 and 1390. This artistic legacy was extended into the fifteenth century, as Donatello and Antonio Rossellino produced impressive sculptures in the nave, and an architect (traditionally identified as Filippo Brunelleschi, but now thought to have been Domenico Michelozzo) designed and constructed the Pazzi Chapel between 1434 and 1474 using a stylistic vocabulary consistent with that seen in the facade of the Ospedale degli Innocenti. A site of enormous civic significance, the corpse of Michelangelo Buonarroti was delivered and interred here after the artists death in 1564, and the monument erected in the south wall of the nave near the entrance still attracts pilgrims to this day. Since then, major monuments have been installed in the nave to celebrate the lives and accomplishments of Italys most famous writers, scientists, and inventors.",

        "content"  : "Baptism in Florence The ritual of baptism was a crucial feature of fourteenth- and fifteenth-century Florence. This symbolic practice carried both a spiritual and social weight integral for full participation in the fabric of Florentine society. Baptism was not only a means of defense against hellfire, but an introduction to civic society and a foundational moment in each individuals life. While some of the finer details of the practice are unclear to contemporary scholars, we now know that by 1128 the ritual was performed at the octagonal Baptistery of San Giovanni, located directly across from the cathedral. Christian baptism was first practiced by John the Baptistpatron saint of the city of Florenceas evidenced in the New Testament Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. In these narratives, Jesus sees John baptizing his followers and walks into the River Jordan to participate, thus cementing the ritual as one of the sacraments of the Christian church. In keeping with this tradition, the ritual originally consisted of the individual being immersed in water, signifying the washing away of sin and marking one as both a child of God and a member of the Church, but with the practice changing over time to center on infant baptisms, the ritual cleansing was changed from full immersion to a mere sprinkling of water on the top of the newborns head, probably to avoid the embarrassing possibility of accidentally drowning the child who had been brought before the font. Originally, adult baptisms were performed only on Holy Saturday (between Good Friday and Easter Sunday) and the Pentecost vigil, but this changed as the citys population grew during the late Middle Ages  and as the specter of infant mortality reared its ugly head. As parents sought to preserve the souls of their children and spare them from eternal punishment, babies were often baptized within days of their birth. These doctrinal fears were only exacerbated as the Black Death swept through Europe during the mid-14th century, killing tens of thousands in Florence alone and underscoring the prevailing notion that the only hope lay in the promise of an afterlife  but a promise that could only be sealed through baptism. The ritual itself began with the parents (usually just the father) and godparents processing through the streets, carrying the child, to the south doors of the baptistery where they would be met by the priest (Baptism, Movement 134). After performing a few initial rituals, prayers, and blessings to cleanse the child of unclean spirits, the priest then invited the parent and godparents to bring the child into the baptistery (136-7). Once inside, more prayers were spoken over the child, it was anointed with oil, and finally received the baptism by having water sprinkled or poured on its head while the priest recited the words of Christ from Matthew 28:19 I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit (143-9). The rise of this practice of infant baptism necessarily increased the volume of individuals seeking baptism at San Giovanni, and so by the late 13th century baptisms were held daily instead of only a handful of times a year (The Two Fonts 87). The practice of infant baptism also paved the way for the social impact of the ritual; as baptisms were public events, the baptism of a child was her or his introduction to the Florentine community (78). The child publicly received a name during the ritual, while newly appointed godparents stood in attendance, the latter of which were particularly instrumental in the childs socioeconomic advancement. These godparents were often selected by parents for their communal connections, and could result in the creation or strengthening of financial or political alliances, in much the same way that such connections could be formed through advantageous marriages for children (Haas). The social importance of baptism was emphasized in the creation of the public fresco of the Abandonment of Children and the Reunification of Families by Niccol di Pietro Gerini and Ambrogio di Baldese in 1386. Painted on the wall of the Bigallo immediately opposite the south doors of the baptistery, this fresco was displayed to the most important zone of the piazza (Bent 95). Portraying members of the Confraterntiy of the Misericordia accepting children into their orphanage and then returning those children to their families, the Abandonment of Children and the Reunification of Families served to remind the caregivers of newly baptized infants of their parental responsibilities, and of the aid offered by the Confraternity should those responsibilities become too burdensome (96). This fresco is one image among many which testifies to the centrality of proper parenting in Florentine society. Taking place daily, in the center of the city, in front of the greatest church in Florence, the ritual of baptism was a fixture of Renaissance Florence whose practice greatly influenced both the communal and familial spheres of life.

        "content"  : "Childbirth in Florence A womans physical environment reflected her status within the family unit and Florentine society. When a young woman married, she moved from her family home directly into that of her husband. Childbirth typically occurred in the home, specifically the home of the fathers family, rather than in a hospital. In place of a doctor, a midwife without formal instruction but trained by experience served as the main help to a woman in labor. After delivering the baby, the midwife cut the umbilical cord, washed and swaddled the child, and announced the baby to the gathered friends and family. A hired guardadonna also attended to the mother and assisted the midwife with the delivery. In some households, slaves or domestic servants also acted as assistants. While childbirth afforded Florentine women a rare moment of reprieve from the male gaze, certain practices both challenged and reinforced the lack of agency afforded to the typical middle- or upper-class woman. Though this space distinctly lacked a male presence, the responsibility for hiring and paying these women often fell on the husband. Without suffering through the horrors of childbirth by his wifes side, a husband subtly influenced the process from afar. Men happily left the women to their work during labor because childbirth came with a unique set of dangers and fears. The laboring Florentine mother walked the same tenuous line between life and death that the modern mother does, though without the aid of modern technology and medicine. Florentine women, however, created their own arsenal of aids, especially religious ones. Besides praying to the Virgin Mary, women sometimes turned to the tale of St. Margaret (who was reputed to have performed a miracle when she was swallowed by a dragon and emerged unharmed) to focus on the safe delivery of her baby through intense pain. Wine took the edge off the pain to some degree, but the screams coming from a womans room still deterred any curious man from entering. Despite the many assistants, the risk of death remained high for both the woman and her newborn child. One estimate based on data from the years 1424, 1425, and 1430 claims that childbirth accounted for one-fifth of the deaths of married Florentine women. Even if both mother and child initially survived, the threat of infection, illness, or a fresh wave of the Black Death discouraged parents from getting too attached to their children. The practice of sending children to wet nurses or balia within just days of their birth and baptism contributed to the emotional separation between parent and child necessary for surviving uncertain times. This distant attitude toward young children manifested in glaring oversights in catasto records such as the underreporting of infants and generous rounding of ages. Though helpful as a coping mechanism, this separation also deprived a mother of an opportunity to exert some influence over her children, a facet of a womans life usually considered safely within the domestic realm and thus properly under her control.

        "content"  : "The Guelph-Ghibelline Rivalry A combination of factors led to the conflict between Guelphs and Ghibellines in Florence during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Although the aggressive actions of Emperor Frederick I catalyzed the Guelph vs Ghibelline rivalry, it was a young Florentine nobleman named Buondelmonte deBuondelmonti who caused the local rivalry to spiral into bitter violence. The terms Guelph and Ghibelline have Germanic origins. The former developed from the house of Welf, a dynasty of Bavarian dukes who fought for the imperial throne through the later Middle Ages. The latter originated from the name of a castle called Waiblingen, the seat of the Hohenstaufen dukes of Swabia and the family that governed the Holy Roman Empire  and the enemies of the Welf family. These terms acquired significance in northern Italy during the reign of the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbossa. Frederick advanced south of the Alps in 1175, determined to reassert imperial authority over northern Italy. Fearing a threat to his own political potentcy in Lombardy, the newly elected Pope Alexander III firmly opposed Fredericks aggressive conquest, resulting in a split peninsula: the Guelphs in support of the papacy and the Ghibellines in support of the emperor. With the help of his Lombard League, Pope Alexander III eventually triumphed over Frederick I at Legnano in 1176, restoring order to the relationship between emperor and pope. However, the rivalry between the two camps continued to simmer all through the region. This rivalry came to a boil in Florence after a fierce altercation involving several rival families in 1216. According to the chronicle of Dino Compagni (ca. 1310), a Florentine Guelph nobleman Boundelmonte deBuondelmonti had promised to take as his wife a daughter of a local patrician named Oderigo Giantruffetti. Before the marriage took place, Buondelmonte was offered an alternate bride, the daughter of Madonna Aldruda, a Ghibelline gentlewoman from the Donati house. Although betrothed to another, Buondelmonte accepted this proposal and reneged on his earlier agreement with the Giantruffetti, an action which infuriated Oderigo and his family. Incensed by this act of humiliaiton, Oderigo and his allies vowed to avenge his daughter and set out to Buondelmonte on the day of his marriage. However, a member of the Uberti family intercepted their action and convinced them to murder the treacherous groom instead of merely assaulting him: the assassination forced Florentines to take sides  probably based on pre-existing animosities and alliances between families  which in turn developed into an unending social and political rift that split the city. At this point, officials lost their ability to control rampant political polarization and violence. Florence became a toxic factionalized environment. As internal conflict plagued Florence, the city ignored imperial authority and followed its own policy preferences, which routinely favored papal political interests. This insubordination angered Emperor Frederick II who advanced into Italy in 1237 on the pretense of quelling this disobedience. In response to the instability in Florence, the Emperor appointed one of his illegitimate sons, Frederick of Antioch, as Podest of Florence. The arrival of this imperial bastard renewed quarrels among the Florentine aristocracy, thereby worsening the savage disputes between Guelphs and Ghibellines. What had begun as an international crisis between pope and emperor devolved into a local crisis, which then developed into an international affair once again.

        "content"  : "Agnolo Gaddi (1350-1396) Agnolo Gaddi was born into an artistic family sometime around 1350. His father, Taddeo Gaddi, was a Florentine painter and architect; his grandfather, Gaddo di Zanobi, was a Florentine artist credited with the mosaic of the Coronation of the Virgin in the Duomo. Agnolos father, Taddeo, studied with the great Giotto di Bondone and painted in Giottos style throughout his prominent artistic career. Taddeo taught his sons, Agnolo and Giovanni, how to paint through the same methods that Giotto taught him, connecting Agnolos pedigree back to that influential painter. As a student of the Giotto school of painting, Agnolo painted with a high sense of naturalism, aiming to portray his figures with a realistic sense of perspective, and allowing for an authentic engagement between the viewer and the painting. In achieving such Giotto-esque naturalism, Agnolo earned the bids for numerous commissions throughout his short career, including Papal commissions, altarpieces, and other religious frescos. Agnolo began his formal painting career in 1369 in Rome with his brother, Giovanni. From July to October they completed a project to decorate a portion of the Vatican, commissioned by Pope Urban the Fifth, that they shared with the established Lombard painter, Giovanni da Milano. After completing the decoration in the Vatican, Agnolos name is not seen in records until 1376, when he appears in Florence. His name is recorded with more frequency in the 1380s, as he received a series of painterly commissions; this includes what has come to be known as his best and most prominent work, the series dedicated to the Legend of the True Cross in the Cappella Maggiore of the Church of Santa Croce. Agnolo received many other commissions throughout the 1380s and 1390s, including the paintings Madonna Enthroned with Saint and Angels, Coronation of the Virgin, Madonna of Humility with Angels, and Crucifixion. Agnolos ability to create a unification throughout a composition made him a highly coveted painter during the late fourteenth century, yet his talents were not solely confined to painting. Agnolos name appears on statues for the faade of the Cathedral of Florence, indicating that he was likely the designer or gilder of these statues. He was not solely a painter, rather he was a renaissance man, equipped with skills and knowledge to excel in multiple crafts. Agnolos death in 1396 put an end to a successful and imaginative artistic career. He was buried in the Church of Santa Croce on October 16, 1396. Agnolo Gaddi boasts achievements for being the last painter under the Giotto-style techniques, while also being an excellent designer of sculptures. Bibliography Cole, Bruce.

His abilities were such that the officers of the Company of the Misericordia hired him to sculpt two different projects in the late 1350s and early 1360s for their residence on the Piazza S. Giovanni, now known as the Bigallo. They chose him, the documents in the Archivio di Stato di Firenze say, because they believed the quality of his sculptures would be comparable to those recently completed by Andrea Pisano for the Baptistery and the Campanile: [The] captains of this confraternity  deliberated on the following things: First, they agreed to offer to Alberto Arnoldi, master from the parish of San Michele Berteldi, the commission to produce an image in marble of Our Lady holding her Son in her arms  with two angels. All of these figures must be by the hand of Alberto, who shall receive a salary of 55 florins for the figure of our Lady and one hundred thirty florins for the two angels, who should be holding candles in their hands: the figure of Mary should be of a higher quality than the figure of Our Lady in Pisa. Its quality will be judged by three or four masters deemed to be qualified by the city of Florence, which shall appoint them at the time. And if it is deemed to be inferior to the one in Pisa, the Bigallo will not be obligated to keep it. And the images of the marble angels must be of the same quality and beauty of the said figure of Mary. He will be paid in the following manner: he will recieve an initial payment of one hundred gold florins, and when the figure of Our Lady has been completed to our satisfaction he will have fifty gold florins, and when he has completed the angels he will receive fifty gold florins; he will compose and install in the oratory the figures at his own expense. And the figures will be completed in two years from the time of their initiation, as indicated by the date of the first payment of one hundred florins. When work was completed in 1361, Alberto Arnoldi received his payments. At precisely this time, that is in 1358, Arnoldi was selected to serve as the administrator of art works to be produced in the cathedral of Florence, the walls of which were then being built up around the old church of S. Reparata (still in use despite being enveloped by the much larger S. Maria del Fiore that was rising up all around it). Arnoldi must have been an artist of note. However, we must temper this evaluation with important caveats. First, Arnoldi produced very few works that have survived to this day. The only works we can ascribe to him convincingly are the Madonna and Angels altar inside the Bigallo and the Madonna and Child on its faade. Were he truly a valued sculptor in that period, surely we would have more works from his hand. Second, Arnoldis name does not appear in documents that address the most important sculptural projects of the day: he was not involved in the production of Andrea di Ciones massive Baldacchino installed in Orsanmichele, the continuation of the project to add reliefs to the Campanile, or the carving of figures for the faade of the Duomo. While he obviously caught the eye of the Captains of the Bigallo, he was not considered in the same league as Andrea. And third, despite his work for the Bigallo and inside the Duomo, Arnoldis output was not large enough or interesting enough to warrant comment by Lorenzo Ghiberti in his 15th-century art history text (the Commentarii) or by Giorgio Vasari in his 16th-century Lives of the Artists, both of whom devoted at least passing references to a host of other equally undistinguished craftsmen. Alberto Arnoldi was the fourteenth-century equivalent of a One-Hit Wonder. The sculptures for the Bigallo are all thats left for us to consider from his career. Bibliography Earenfight, Phillip.

        "content"  : "The Albizzi Family The obsession with power among Florentine elites that revolved around a desire to enjoy political immunity and tax concessions defined the latter half of the Trecento. These elite aligned themselves in several ways, including through familial alliances, guilds, and political parties. The Albizzi family in particular rose to power during the last quarter of the fourteenth century through their increasing influence over bureaucratic offices and their perceived interest in the common good. The Albizzi first moved to Florence from Arezzo in the twelfth century, and thanks to their acumen as wool merchants and financiers, by the beginning of the Trecento had established themselves as one of the most prominent popolano families. As a result, their political influence swelled in the second half of the Trecento. By the 1360s, two rival factions emerged: the Albizzi who represented the Parte Guelfa (who advocated for alliances with the Papacy and Naples) and the Ricci family who advocated for more popular representation. The rival factions fought bitterly until 1372 when the Florentine Signoria declared that the Albizzi were banned from holding public office for five years. During this ban one of the most prominent members of the Albizzi lineage, Maso degli Albizzi, first experienced the sting of political defeat as he was ousted from his first political role in Pistoia, a region under Florentine control. But his humiliation was short-lived, as Maso returned to lead the Florentine Signoria after the Ciompi Revolt ended in 1382. The Albizzi managed to grab power in the city after a lengthy and at times violent period that followed the disastrous military campaign against the Papacy, known as the War of the Eight Saints (1375-1378), that had sucked the citys revenues dry and imposed on the Florentine population unusually restrictive religious penalties that drained the populations patience with its political representatives. In 1378, a coalition comprised of underrepresented laboring guilds and members of the sotto posti  people who did not belong to any guild at all  staged an uprising against the middle and upper guilds whose quasi-republican government had for decades disenfranchised these laborers by preventing their participation in the government. Curiously, these rebellious laborers  known by the collective term Ciompi  found allies in the leaders of the two rival factions of the Albizzi and the Ricci families, who saw in the revolt an opportunity to weaken the governments power in a time of civil strife. This led to the so-called Ciompi Revolt of June 1378 which, in a watered-down form, lasted until January 1382. During this time, a more egalitarian system of civic representation was established in which merchants, artisans, and laborers held an equal proportion of offices with an equal share of power. The government was short-lived as alliances amongst laboring factions dissolved and a coalition of merchants, industrialists, and artisans suppressed civil the more progressive impulses of the Ciompi. By early 1382, the laborers and their leaders were under the control of the elites once again. The oligarchic regime that governed Florence in the wake of the Ciompi Revolt moved to return the citys politicaly system to one that favored the interests of the elites at the expense of laborers. This political machine was run by the patricians of the city who controlled both commerce and policy initiatiaves; at the helm of this machine was Maso degli Albizzi, an intuitive politician known for his personal charisma, charm, and diplomatic grace. Maso and his fellow patricians negated the egalitarian reforms created during the Ciompi period and reinstituted a structure that gave a greater voice (and a substantial majority in committees) to greater guildsmen. With Maso at the helm, a system was installed and maintained that increased the income disparity between the Haves and Have-Nots, realigned the city with the papal authority, and enhanced its military posture during the subsequent period of internecine Italian conflicts. It also overtly underrepresented the lower classes in the political process, and utterly excluded the sotto posti, people in surrounding territories of Florence, and the citys most destitute constituents. Masos control of the government lasted until his death in 1417, at which time his son Rinaldo degli Albizzi took control of the city until his factions demise at the hands of Cosimo deMedici in 1434.

        "content"  : "Andrea della Robbia The distinctive roundels on the Loggia feature white glazed terracotta infants on blue backgrounds. Set between the arches of the Loggia, the ten sculpted children have become the symbols of the Ospedale degli Innocenti. Sculpted figures in lunettes were often employed to distinguish a buildings faade from those of other similar structures in the city, but the Innocentis emphasis on the function of the hospital created an unprecedented level of clarity. The roundels represent the Innocenti as an institution, revealing a depth of history about the hospitals segno, and stylistically, they speak to the mastery of Andrea della Robbia. The infants in the roundels represent the Ospedale degli Innocentis segno. During the opening ceremony of the hospital in 1445 the rector Lapo di Piero Pacini wore a black robe adorned with a bambino on his chest. This insignia was also depicted on the lead reliquary box associated with the dedication of the church hospital, which was in 1451. The original version of the insignia featured a child being placed in a pila, a receptacle located under the loggia. This iconography clearly identified the child as a foundling and connected the segno with the mission of the hospital. In records in the Innocentis archives, an artist was paid for 104 painted bambolini on pieces of paper that could be attached to the foundlings chests. This repetitive imagery clearly establishes the image of the infant in the pila as a symbol of the Innocenti itself. The practice of relating the segno to the work of a specific institution was common, but the emblem of a child was unprecedented in Florence. The image of the Innocentis segno changed over time, and after 1460 was represented as a standing swaddled infant, which was more easily reproduced than the infant in the pila. The recognizable symbol was found on two volumes of Ricordanze in hospital archives, paired with the symbol of the Silk Guild. This iconography can be associated with the Christian tradition of holy figures, such as Christ, the Virgin Mary, and John the Baptist being represented as swaddled infants. The tight swaddles communicate safety and security, which the hospital provides its foundlings. This is the image that is portrayed on the roundels. These swaddled infants resemble putti, which, combined with Brunelleschis architecture, visually connect to the putti reliefs on Donatellos tabernacle of Sant Louis of Toulouse. The ten roundels represent a similar segno but each contain creative differences. The first and tenth roundels depict infants with a contrapposto pose and a bent arm to accommodate the capital of the pilasters. The other infants have both of their arms out, and the even numbered roundels depict infants looking left and the odd ones looking right. Although Andrea della Robbia seems to follow this pattern, each of the infants differ in facial expression and depiction of their bodies. The second infant exposes his foot, and the ninth infant has a brown cloth under the swaddling. On the fifth roundel, the infants bands fall, exposing his male genitalia. On the tenth infant, the swaddling falls to his knees, perhaps indicating the growth of a child. These creative variations to the official segno and the brilliant blue background are masterful. In his History of Florence (1423), merchant Goro Dati described the Innocenti and praised its insignia, which shaped how the Florentine people perceived the institution and its function. The swaddled infant as an emblem was unprecedented and developed over time to become a recognizable symbol. Andrea della Robbias roundels reflect this desire to establish an official insignia, and his work at the Innocenti became famous in its own right. Bibliography Domestici, Fiamma.

        "content"  : "Andrea di Bonaiuto (ca. 1325-1379) Born around 1325, the painter Andrea di Bonaiuto survived the bubonic plague which swept through Florence in 1348 and worked in Pisa and Florence until his death in 1379. Relatively few archival records of his life remain, and he signed and dated virtually none of his works. However, his most significant achievement, the fresco cycle in the chapterhouse of Santa Maria Novella (for which documents do survive), serves as one of the great artistic triumphs of the Trecento, and provides important insights into Florentine religious life. Andrea entered the Florentine Guild of Doctors and Apothecaries in 1346 and, beginning in 1351, lived in the quarter of Santa Maria Novella that was named for the great basilica of the Dominican Order. His work bears resemblance to that of Nardo di Cione (ca. 1320-1365), another Florentine artist with whom he may have apprenticed. Andrea left Florence in 1355 to work in Pisa for roughly ten years. When he returned in 1365, he received the commission to decorate the walls of Santa Maria Novellas chapterhouse, now known as the Spanish Chapel. In return for his work, Zanobi Guasconi, the prior of Santa Maria Novella at the time, granted Andrea and his wife a house valued at sixty-five florins (the modern equivalent of roughly $130,000). Andreas contract stated that he complete the project within a period of two years, beginning on January 1, 1366, and he appears to have honored this stipulation. The Dominican chapterhouse served as one of the focal points of daily Dominican life and ritual. Many liturgical and ceremonial functions took place there, as well as the day-to-day administration of the chapter. Upon the arrivals of prominent visitors, the Dominicans would have guided their guests first to the chapterhouse, the center of their organization. Thus, the pictures that decorated the chapterhouse would have been seen by the Dominicans on a daily basis and would represent their chapter to visitors. Although one of the Dominicans probably devised the mural cycles sophisticated program, their decision to commission Andrea for the chapterhouse decorations demonstrates their esteem for him and his work. Scenes from the Passion of Christ make up the cycles central image, with images of the Way to Calvary, the Crucifixion, and the Harrowing of Hell covering the north wall of the chapel. Other images such as the Via Veritatis depict Saints Dominic, Peter Martyr, and Thomas Aquinas celebrating the intellectual and spiritual triumphs of the Order. In the same year he received the chapterhouse commission, civic leaders in Florence appointed Andrea to a committee tasked with designing the dome for Florences cathedral. He served as a committee member for two years until 1367, and the representation of the domed cathedral in the Via Veritatis surely reflects his own conception of how that cupola ought to have looked. Andrea spent brief periods of the next ten years working in both Orvieto and Pisa. Upon his death in 1379, he left behind only a meager sum for his widow and child, suggesting that Andreas expenses largely outpaced his revenues. Despite the rather quiet end to his career, Andreas frescos on the walls of Santa Maria Novellas chapterhouse document Dominican identity, preserve examples of their particular world view, and present their take on larger issues of Christian ideology. These images stand as some of western Europes most important achievements of late fourteenth-century painting. Bibliography Bent, George. Andrea Di Bonaiuto.

        "content"  : "Andrea Pisano As his surname suggests, Andrea Pisano came from the city of Pisa, located some 45 miles to the west of Florence on the banks of the Mediterranean Sea. Although not directly descended from the father-son team of Nicola and Giovanni Pisano, Andreas contributions to the legacy of fourteenth-century art are no less important than those of his more famous predecessors. Archival references to Andreas birth and upbringing have not survived, but later records indicate that the sculptor came from a small village called Pontedera that was, at the turn of the fourteenth century, under Pisan control. His father was a notary named Ugolino, and as an adolescent Andrea was sent to Pisa to apprentice as a goldsmith. He soon branched out into the world of sculpture and was active carving wooden figures in and around Pisa in the early 1320s. He seems to have worked in Siena and Orvieto as well, and by the beginning of the next decade had acquired a reputation elevated enough to earn him the commission from the Arte della Calimala to design, cast, and chase the monumental reliefs for the south doors of the Florentine Baptistery of S. Giovanni. An inscription on that door dates the early phase of this project to 1330, and the last of the panels was installed just before June 24, 1336, the all-important Feast of St. John the Baptist. As this project came to a conclusion, Andrea picked up a second major commission, this one from the Arte della Lana, or Wool Guild. As Giotto oversaw the design and construction of the foundations for the Campanile adjacent to the cathedral, Andrea was charged with the task of producing marble reliefs dedicated to scenes from Genesis. When Giotto died in 1337, however, Andrea appears to have taken control over the entire project: he seems to have revised the architectural plans for the structure, even then showing signs of weakness, and added a sculptural program that revolved around the subjects of the Labors of Man, the Madonna and Child, and the Sibyls and Prophets that were placed in the zone of the niches. Although his name has been associated with the construction of Orsanmichele, there is no way to confirm his role in the design of that building. By 1343 Andrea had returned to his homeland, where he formed a working partnership with his son, Tino, in the city of Pisa. He stayed there for four years, overseeing the design and completion of a number of monumental sculptures for various churches in the city, including the cathedral, S. Caterina, and S. Maria della Spina. But in 1347 he moved back to Orvieto to take up duties of capomaestro of the cathedrals works, a short-lived endeavor. By 1349, Andrea was either dead or retired, with Nino taking over for him as head of the works for that site. The absence of references to him after that year suggests that Andrea Pisano, like so many others in Europe, fell victim to the Black Death of 1348. Style and Influence Andrea Pisanos stylistic choices reveal a faithful adherence to the traditions forged by his senior Pisan forebear, Giovanni Pisano. With a preference for elongated figures that sway with Gothic undulations, Andreas approach to narrative and didactic art intentionally sacrifices rational order and distinctively naturalistic settings in order to highlight emotionally charged and dramatically compelling actions. Diminutive trees, abstracted mountains, and streams that have no perceptible banks serve merely as contexts for the more important gestural and expressive qualities of characters that Andrea tries to imbue with spiritual vivacity. Andrea Pisanos role in shaping the late medieval taste for sculpture in Florence cannot be exaggerated. The south portal of the Baptistery of S. Giovanni was the most important setting for the all-important ritual of baptism that welcomed infants into the community and forged essential links between parents, godparents, and family members. Andreas reliefs literally and figuratively framed that ritual after their completion in 1336, and its safe to say that every single person who had been born or who had parented a child in the city after that year had spent a long time looking at them at least once in her or his lifetime. The hexagonal and diamond-shaped reliefs that Andrea executed for the Campanile, while more difficult to see due to their elevated placement, were among the only other public works of sculpture that anyone could examine in Florence: the effigies in the niches of Orsanmichele, many of the sculptures for the faade of the Duomo, and Ghibertis relief panels for the North and East doors of the Baptistery all came decades later. The power of this Pisan artist at first served as an influential exemplum of the fashionable style in sculpture that was all the rage in Pisa, Paris, and beyond, and then later served as the foil for those artists of the next generations who aimed to alter that style and the tastes that celebrated it. Andrea Pisano both set the standard that future sculptors strove to meet and represented all the things they hoped to avoid. Bibliography Moskowitz, Anita.

        "content"  : "Arnolfo di Cambio (ca. 1240-1302) Although Arnolfo di Cambio is best known for his architectural achievements in Florence, the Sienese sculptor and architect (c. 1240) began as a student and assistant to Nicola Pisano, who many consider the leading figure in the art of sculpture, just as Giotto was an innovator in painting. During his time under Nicola Pisano, Arnolfo helped with the construction of the reliefs for the marble pulpit of Siena Cathedral (1265) and those for the Tomb of San Dominic (1264-67). Arnolfo developed his classical style during this period and continued working in this idiom throughout his career. Although he remained heavily influenced by Nicola Pisano in Siena, Arnolfos own style evolved after his move to Rome around 1277. While in the service of Charles of Anjou, Arnolfo revived the classical past in works such as the representation of the enthroned French Duke (c. 1280), which is thought to be one of the earliest portrait statues since ancient times, and the bronze statue of St. Peter for the Vatican (c. 1290), which is still venerated by pilgrims to this day. Arnolfo also carved the innovative Monument to Cardinal De Braye (1282) in the church of S. Domenico, Orvieto. By combining the classicists attention to volume and proportion with the elegance and intricacy of a Gothicizing artist, the sculptor created a theatrical scene that relates the death of the cardinal to his eternal salvation above. The style and construction that he used would influence wall tombs for over a century. Arnolfo di Cambios two altar canopies in San Paolo fuori le Mura (1285) and Santa Cecilia in Trastevere (1293) suggest his engagement with the Rayonnant Gothic style typically associated with the patronage of Louis IX of France. While both canopies demonstrate a keen eye towards form, proportion, and geometry, the employment of lacework, intricate patterns, and columns that taper toward the top suggest an awareness of the French artistic tradition. Other works that suggest Arnolfos responsiveness to this style include the Ciboria at St. Pauls (1284), the Annibaldi monument in Saint John Lateran (c.1290), the Crib of Santa Maria Maggiore (1285-91), and the Chapel of St. Boniface (c. 1296). Although he contributed greatly to the beautification of the city, Arnolfo di Cambio lived in Florence for only a short time. Originally brought in as a consultant for the construction of the cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore in 1296 (completed only in 1436 when Filippo Brunelleschi finished the famous cupola over the buildings crossing), recent research suggests that the basic layout of Santa Croce was also designed by Arnolfo in 1295, and Vasari attributed to Arnolfo the designs for the Palazzo Vecchio (initiated in 1298). His sculpted works can be seen in the faade of the Duomo, which include the Nativity, the Dormition (destroyed), and the Madonna and Child (1296), as well as the effigy of the Enthroned Pope Boniface VIII that harkens back to Arnolfos images of St. Peter and Charles of Anjou in Rome. For his work in Florence, Arnolfo di Cambio would be honored by the Council of One Hundred in 1300, but the artist enjoyed this prestigious award only briefly: his activity was cut short by his untimely death in 1302.

        "content"  : "Bernardo Daddi A late contemporary of the famous painter Giotto di Bondone, Bernardo Daddi (ca. 1280  1348) became one of Florences most popular and most important producers of panel pictures during the two decades that preceded the advent of Bubonic Plague. The identity of his master remains unclear, and speculations range from Giotto himself to obscure miniaturists like the elusive Master of the Dominican Effigies. His approach to figures and scenes belies an understanding of popular trends in Trecento painting, with a complete reliance on layered hues of egg tempera pigments creating colorful (if somewhat rigid) forms that immediately capture ones attention. But Daddi was no slavish imitator, and he intentionally departed from the naturalistic and expressive figures produced by his more famous predecessor in his quest for painting characters deserving of devotional attention from viewers. His traditionalist, somewhat conservative approach retained much of the brilliance of earlier Tuscan painting in Florence and nearby Siena without the addition of potentially distracting gestural or overly emotional elements. The first mention of Bernardo Daddi appears in a document dated 1312, when the artist matriculated into the Arte dei Medici e Speziali (Guild of the Doctors and Apothecaries), which included in its membership the painters of Florence. He signed his name on a triptych (now in the Uffizi, Florence) in 1328, and did the same in 1333 at the base of a similarly designed devotional painting now in the Bigallo. At that point, the painter began to enjoy considerable favor among local patrons. Daddis works dotted the Florentine urban landscape by the time of his death in 1348, and the location of his paintings reveals both his popularity with lay viewers and his importance as something of a civil servant. In addition to the altarpiece he produced for the Dominicans in S. Maria Novella and the frescoes of Saint Stephen that he painted in the massive Franciscan church of S. Croce, Daddis images adorned the audience hall of the Misericordia, the guild residence of the Arte dei Medici e Speziali, the high altar of the cathedral, and in 1335 the private chapel for the citys governors inside the Palazzo della Signoria. He was responsible for a popular pictorial type called the Madonna del Bagnuolo, produced in the mid-1330s, a painting within a painting that shows the activation of an altarpiece before devotees on bended knee before it. In 1346 Daddi was the painter selected by the Captains of Orsanmichele to replace a miracle-working panel that had adorned a column there in the grain distribution center since at least 1292. Indeed, Daddis version of this cult image gained an immediate following after its completion in 1347, as confraternity members soon engulfed the single dossal panel within Andrea Orcagnas enormous and elaborate sculpted marble baldachin, the likes of which had never been seen before, and the single object that consistently received praise as the most important impressive object in the entire commune. Were it not for the massive and extensive polyptych that the painter produced for the high altar of the Duomo in 1342, known today as the S. Pancrazio Altarpiece and exhibited today in the Uffizi Musuems, the Madonna of Osanmichele would have been his best-known painting. Daddi was obviously a trusted commodity, and that fact that his rise to prominence and popularity among some of the citys most important civic patrons coincides almost exactly with the election of Giotto to the post of City Artist in 1334 suggests that public commissions may have been sub-contracted by Giotto to Daddi as the older artists output slowed near the end of his life. Although Giotto is usually credited with the transition away from Romanesque or Byzantine painting to a more proto-Renaissance style, it was Bernardo Daddi who probably had the greatest impact on successive generations of Florentine artists. His students appear to have included Andrea Orcagna and possibly Nardo di Cione, the two brothers who survived the plague of 1348 and inherited the mantel of Best Artists Alive soon thereafter. Their students  among them Andrea di Bonaiuto, Jacopo di Cione, Giovanni del Biondo, and probably Niccol di Pietro Gerini  went on to train the next generation of great Florentine artists (including, probably, Lorenzo Monaco), and so on, right on into the middle of the fifteenth century. Blasphemous as it may sound, there is more of Bernardo Daddis art and legacy to be found in Trecento Florence than that of Giottos.

        "content"  : "Fabio Borbottoni: Railroad Employee, Amateur Painter, Unrepentant Romantic Fabio Borbottoni (1823-1901), a minor official in the Italian Railroad system, practiced painting as a hobby. The Florentine native produced over 120 small, square pictures of the citys medieval structures as they appeared to him during the years of the Risorgimento  the period of Italian unification and statehood that arose during the decade of the 1860s and the latter decades of the nineteenth century when a national identity began to formulate. It was precisely during this period that the citys built environment changed dramatically. Medieval walls that ringed the ancient urban core were demolished, with only a few of the major gateways preserved for posteritys sake. Laborers attached marble facades to the Duomo and the basilica of S. Croce to create a kind of harmony in keeping with original facings on the Baptistery of S. Giovanni, the friary of S. Maria Novella, and the monastic church of S. Miniato al Monte. Old structures along the river, like the old mills run by the city mint, were torn down and replaced by wide avenues that cut along both sides of the Arno. Most importantly, the very heart of the Florentine commercial district  that which contained the ancient Mercato Vecchio, a dozen of the citys medieval guild headquarters, and the adjacent Jewish Ghetto formed in the 15th century  was completely demolished and replaced with newer boutiques, public buildings, and a square dubbed the Piazza della Republica, all of which was inspired by a Parisian style of urban planning then popular in Europe. The social and architectural character of Old Florence was quickly dying. Borbottoni lamented the destruction of the medieval city and intentionally placed his easel at strategic locations that allowed him to capture these areas before they disappeared forever. The churches of S. Tommaso and S. Maria in Campidoglio, for example, appear in multiple compositions, as do the famous oratory of S. Maria della Tromba and the Fish Loggia that now stands in the eastern portion of the city: all of these formed important monumental landmarks in the Mercato Vecchio that were earmarked for destruction or removal in the 1880s. Buildings that featured prominently in his paintings include palaces once owned and occupied by famous protagonists of the Renaissance, as well as major ecclesiastical institutions once packed with art works that, then as well as now, are considered to be major monuments of western culture. Indeed, despite the presence of miniscule figures who sit, stand, and walk about in the spaces he creates, Borbottonis subject matter revolved primarily around the built environment rather than the people who occupied it: those figures appearing in his paintings serve only as scale measurements to help viewers understand the dimensions of the structures in each painting. Borbottoni knew that the design sensibility of the medieval city, still visible to him at the end of the nineteenth century, was doomed to oblivion. He took great pains to capture the earth tones of exterior walls, the marble balustrades on staircases leading to main portals, and the colorful fabrics that sometimes hung from windows or niches of buildings. The dusty roads of the center that he painted often jar with the tram lines that supplanted the city walls, reputedly designed and constructed under the supervision of Arnolfo di Cambio. And the bridges that connect the ancient Roman urban core to the north of the city with the medieval and early modern structures in the OltrArno to the south were carefully studied and reproduced  and thankfully so, as these paintings became important documents during their reconstruction after their demolition by Nazi forces in the summer of 1944. Still, the painters vision of his city was not completely accurate. Borbottoni often took liberties with the actual appearance of the spaces he reproduced in paint. Two versions of the famous Piazza della Signoria, for example, offer divergent heights of the same buildings, suggesting that the Railway officer took some artistic license when his compositions demanded some assistance. He romanticized a number of his landscape vistas, turning the run-down Zecca Vecchia and the deeply problematic Debtors Prison (called the Stinche) into a lovely vestiges of the medieval past, and the dank, dark, and dangerous Jewish Ghetto as an antiseptically clean and enticingly attractive neighborhood fit for any upstanding bourgeois homeowner. The few figures that appear in these visions make the city seem open, airy, and relaxed, when in fact Florence had already become a tourist attraction and bustling urban center in the middle of the economically thriving province of Tuscany. Indeed, Florence had served as the first capital city of the new Italian Republic from 1865 to 1870, and all the benefits that had come to it with this important status made it one of the countrys wealthiest and most modern cities. Fabio Borbottoni was a one-man Office of Tourism who nostalgically exaggerated the features of his home town in order to celebrate a notion of a city that didnt really exist, all the while lamenting the gradual demolition of the urban environment that was happening before his eyes during the decades of the 1880s and 1890s. Fabio Borbottoni was not a great painter by contemporary standards. He offered no new way of seeing his world, suggested no actual opinion on the very real issue of urban renewal in a city with a storied past, and sought neither fame nor fortune with the works he produced. But Borbottoni, along with the contemporary critic and Historian Guido Carocci, performed the important task of preserving for posterity the appearance of Florence as it appeared before the violent and permanent reconfigurations of individual structures, entire neighborhoods, and city-wide traffic patterns  albeit with a keenly apologetic and subjectively promotional eye. To them we are indebted for their staunch support of Florentine history, the physical spaces in which so many important events transpired, and the socio-cultural environment in which was born the Italian Renaissance of the fifteenth century. But of them we also must question the accuracy of their representations, the motives behind their nostalgic romanticism, and the veracity of their vision of the old city.",

        "content"  : "Ferdinando del Migliore Ferdinando del Migliore was born in 1628 and spent his adult life researching and writing about the history of Florence. A gifted archivist, del Migliore scoured the registers and contracts of individuals and institutions in an effort to present to his readers accurate accounts of the citys past. In 1684 the noted historian published his most important book, Firenze citt nobilissima illustrata da Ferdinando del Migliore, in which the author recreated the ancient city by examining its buildings, one by one. Using documents as the foundation of his argument, del Migliore refuted legends and hearsay that had been propagated over time and corrected them by publishing the writings he uncovered. His single volume account of Florences history was the model for later projects, most notably Giuseppe Richas multi-tome Notizie istoriche delle chiese fiorentine divise ne suoi quartieri, a vast eighteenth-century review of the citys churches that depended heavily on del Migliores groundbreaking work. Modern readers of del Migliores text value his contributions mostly for the way he employed documents in the examination of each specific building he considered, and his text is best consumed when one focuses on each chapter as a discrete unit, rather than on the entirety of the book as a holistic and complete account of the city. Indeed, his instincts as a student of the past caused him to compile information about major events and local characters, but because his book revolved around specific buildings he tended to discuss these people and actions piecemeal and only when they pertained to the institution under examination in that chapter. Readers rarely get a broad account of the citys history or even an abbreviated timeline of the signature moments that influenced the lives and actions of its residents: this historian did not provide his readers with a chronologically oriented history of Florence. Instead, specific events and transactions pertinent to each edifice are served up as contextual explanations for that structures design and erection, independent of other events that transpired in the city at the same time. Del Migliore cut and pasted centuries worth of history into the individual studies of dozens of buildings, making it nearly impossible to understand the broad sweep of the citys past. But it does present irrefutable evidence about the landmarks in the urban environment that shaped the way people moved, behaved, worshipped, loved, fought, and died for hundreds of years. Translating del Migliore Reading and translating del Migliores prose poses problems for modern interpreters. Writing in the style of the day, the seventeenth-century historians lengthy sentence structure often weaves multiple subjects into single passages, causing readers to untangle a variety of issues that have been wrapped up into one giant textual skein. Del Migliore turns phrases no longer in use, employs creative spelling, and sometimes refers to people, places, and things for which we have no reference today. And his bias for the citys status in the history of western Europe sometimes blinds him to the importance of other places. We dont write the way he did in 1684, and they didnt read the same way we do today. Our team has worked to recast del Migliores text in a way thats more palatable to contemporary readers. Lengthy sentences have been spliced into shorter ones, while unwieldy clauses have been truncated for the sake of clarity. Indeed, this translation is more of an attempt to reveal the sense of del Migliores approach than it is a strict and rigid replacement of English words for Italian ones. Still, we have worked hard to retain the spirit of his influential book and have been careful to include the archival information he provided in the original text as a basis for an understanding of each building that he discussed. All the facts remain; but the style of their presentation has been updated to a certain degree.",

        "content"  : "Gautier de Brienne: Duke of Athens Walter VI of Brienne (Gautier de Brienne), better known as the Duke of Athens, was a French nobleman invited to Florence in 1342 to help the Florentines defeat Pisa and gain possession of Lucca, a neighboring town. Described by the Florentine chronicler Giovanni Villani as cruel, cunning, avaricious, proud, and dictatorial, the duke was criticized by many for his tyrannical rule. In 1326, Walter first came to Florence to serve as the vicar of Charles, the Duke of Calabria, for several months. He returned in 1342 in the wake of unusual turmoil in the city following an economic crash, which was precipitated by King Edward defaulting on loan payments to Florentine banks funding his war against France. After leading the victorious fight against Pisa, Walter was offered the title of Capitano da Guerra. Walter persuaded the Florentines to increase their offer and, much to the chagrin of Guelf leaders, this savior of the city was appointed Podest for life. Initially, the politically dominant patricians supported him and hoped that the Duke would preserve their power against pressures from the impotent magnate and working classes. But, when Walter instead provided greater rights and privileges to the citys traditionally disenfranchised laboring classes, the upper guildsmen of Florence turned against their Podest. Walter sought to equalize the tax burden and to recover communal rights and properties from the hands of the rich poplani grassi and magnate. He appointed special officials to do this and authorized them to keep a register in which were inscribed all of the communes property and rights (bona et iura). His policies, however, were more than an attempt to reform the states economy; they were intended to weaken the power and authority of the greater guildsmen. The last straw came on June 24, when Walter permitted a newly formed guild of unskilled wool workers to lead the annual parade on St. Johns Day, a symbolic gesture that infuriated Wool Guild officials. Walter now threatened the fragile social and economic equilibrium of guild leadership that had been carefully constructed over three generations. Stoked by a conspiracy that emanated from inside the Wool Guild, a mob surrounded the Palazzo Vecchio on Saint Annes Day, July 26, 1343. After a brief siege, the Florentines deposed Walter, forced him into exile, killed members of his French retinue, and ransacked their homes. Saint Annes Day was declared a public holiday and was honored for generations thereafter. Bibliography Baker, Nicholas Scott.

        "content"  : "Giottino (ca. 1324 - 1365) Giottino, also known as Giotto di Stefano, was born around 1324 and lived in Florence until his death in the 1360s, although the exact year of his death is unknown. His father, Maestro Stefano Florentino, was a famous Florentine painter who gained painterly prominence for his naturalistic style, earning him the nickname the Scimmia della Natura (Ape of Nature). Giottino likely received painting instruction from his father, but looked strongly towards the great Giotto in the formation and development of his style. Much of Giottinos written biographical history came from the writings of Vasari in his second writings titled Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects. Giottinos best known works include the 1356 Madonna della Sagra, a fresco painted in a small niche carved into the side of a building in a poor district in Florence. The working-class audience in that neighborhood had complete access to this fresco and, unlike his other paintings, could see this image daily. Giottinos Piet, painted for the Church of San Remigo between 1360 and 1365, holds the crown as his best known individual work. The Piet depicts a scene with twelve people surrounding the dead body of Christ, strewn across a small bedding with his feet on the left side of the image and his head on the right. Seven of the figures kneel around his dead body and offer prayers, while the other five remain standing and look towards Christ. A cross, centered and behind the figures, moves upward through the scene towards the top of the image and emanates to the left and right, adding balance and stillness to the image. Some of the figures in the image have been identified as the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalen, and other Saints, while also depicting two figures in modern attire who were likely the donors for the image. Giottino painted the Piet in a highly naturalistic style, particularly for the 14th century. He appears to possess a rich understanding of the human body and how to portray it, and utilizes a naturalistic perspective and spacing between his figures. The gold background of Piet underscores the scenes holiness, while also serving to show the sanctity of the Church of San Remigo. The Piet serves as an excellent example of Giottinos great mastery of naturalism and perspective during his generation, strongly attributed to the influence of his father and Giotto. Although his work is often overlooked among the strong artistic innovations and creations of the Renaissance, Giotinno was recognized in his own time as a master of his craft. Giotinno was not able to live a full life, as he died in his late thirties or early forties from consumption, yet he still made an impressive mark on Trecento Florentine art.

        "content"  : "Giotto di Bondone (ca. 1265  1337) Few artists in the history of Western Civilization have received as much attention and adulation as Giotto di Bondone, a leading practitioner of a kind of pictorial representation that critics since the time of Giorgio Vasari have credited with initiating a New Style of Art that we now associate with the period we call the Renaissance. Legends surrounding his genius cropped up during his lifetime, and the productivity of his large and active workshop  which extended from the university town of Padua in Northeast Italy all the way down to Naples in the southeast  both inspired generations of imitators and fooled the eyes of generations of critics that followed: as a result, the number of paintings ascribed to his hand is probably much larger than the actual number of images for which he was truly responsible. His origins, like those of most of his peers, can only be guessed at. Giotto appears to have been born in or around the year 1267, and he was certainly a contemporary of the famed poet, Dante Alighieri (who mentions him by name in Purgatorio XI: 91-96), the Sienese master Duccio di Buoninsegna, and the painter Cimabue, who Lorenzo Ghiberti and then Vasari claimed was his master. These two artists, Cimabue and Giotto, were linked together at the height of the latters career. As early as 1315, Dante celebrated them in a rather backwards way by using them as examples of the fleetingness of fame, when he famously wrote: O, empty glory of the powers of humans! How briefly does green endure upon the peak  Unless an age of dullness follows it. In painting, Cimabue thought he held The field, but now its Giotto they acclaim  The former only keeps a shadowed fame. The connection between Cimabue and Giotto was underscored in Ghibertis Commentarii of about 1450, in which the oft-repeated legend of the older artists discovery of the child prodigy  drawing a picture of a sheep on a rock  was first articulated. This initial comment on Giottos interest in using nature as a guide became the signature theme in Ghibertis biography of the painter. Wrote Ghiberti, Giotto was an enormously important figure in the field of painting. He brought forth to prominence the new art, abandoning the clumsiness of the Greeks. He made towering works of greatness, especially in the city of Florence (and in many other places) and collected disciples who were, in every way, the equal of the ancients. Indeed, one sees in Giottos art works that his followers could not better. He elevated nature in art, and with it a certain gentility, without ignoring proper proportions and measures. He was extremely skilled in all the arts, was an inventor and discoverer of many theories which had been buried for almost 600 years. When nature wanted to concede something, it conceded without a single complaint. Embedded in his lengthier biography of Giotto is Vasaris terse remark that Giotto, freed himself from the rude manner of the Greeks and brought back to life the true art of painting. These legends and tropes do little to secure for us an authentic understanding of Giottos origins and early works. Some have connected him to the motherhouse of the Franciscan Order in Assisi and have argued that he was the sole creator of a series of frescoes (produced in the 1290s) in the upper basilica that illustrate scenes from the life of the thirteenth-century saint who started the order. Indeed, a document from the church of S. Francesco ambiguously places him there sometime before 1310, although it is unclear whether Giotto was then actively painting in the upper basilica or in the lower one directly beneath it. While most Anglo-American scholars reject the attribution of the St. Francis cycle to Giotto, believing them instead to have been painted either the so-called St. Cecilia Master or by Roman artists at the behest of the papacy (and Giottos work to have been confined to a single chapel in the lower basilica), the possibility of his activity in upper church of Assisi is still celebrated by Italian scholars  and by the friars who still live and work in the cloister there. By 1300 he appears to have been in Rome, where Giotto is said to have produced for Pope Boniface VIII a massive mosaic dedicated to the Navicella that graced the faade of Old St. Peters basilica until its destruction in the early sixteenth century. As is the case with Giottos other works from this early moment in his career, the Roman project is not documented. The first time Giottos name appears in a written record comes in 1305, when the painter was mentioned working for Enrico Scrovegni in the Paduan chapel that bears the bankers name. Responsible for both the architectural design of that private oratory and the frescoes painted within it, Giotto efficiently completed this project in roughly two years. The so-called Arena Chapel was dedicated on the Feast of the Annunciation, March 25, 1306, and the doors of the space were opened to the public annually on that date to commemorate his achievement. Among those who almost surely saw and marveled at the paintings Giotto produced there was the Florentine exile Dante Alighieri, by then a resident of Padua on the verge of penning one of the most influential works of literature in all of human history. Dantes conception of Hell in the Inferno (initiated around 1307) seems to rely quite heavily on the zones of the damned and the grouping of punishments that appear in the imagined cauldron of Giottos Last Judgment and the damaged souls inside it that the artist painted only a few months before Dante began writing his verses. Giotto then made his way to Assisi, where he oversaw frescoes in the lower basilica of S. Francesco before finally making his way back to Florence  a city he had assiduously avoided for most of the duration of the quasi-civil war there that lasted for nearly all of the first decade of the fourteenth century. By 1312 he had finished an impressive crucifix for the Dominicans at S. Maria Novella that served as a model for younger artists producing similar paintings for the remainder of the Trecento. In 1317, he began a lengthy project to fresco the walls of the Bardi Chapel along the right transept of the Franciscan church of S. Croce, with scenes from the life of St. Francis of Assisi. Just before leaving for Naples in 1328, where Giotto worked for five years as the court artist of Robert of Anjou, his workshop completed frescoes that illustrated the miracles of St. John the Evangelist and St. John the Baptist in the Peruzzi Chapel, adjacent to the aforementioned Bardi Chapel. The altarpiece of the Coronation of the Virgin was probably completed at roughly the same time, that is sometime around 1328, and has much in common with the hotly contested double-sided altarpiece that Cardinal Jacopo Stefaneschi commissioned from Giotto and placed in the canons choir of Old St. Peters basilica in Rome either in 1300 or in 1329. Take your pick. Giottos work in Naples comes down to us only in the form of notices and vague archival references. The elderly artist, then in his sixties, may have painted some works for the Angevin king there, but whatever he completed was ruined by a series of earthquakes that had, by the end of the eighteenth century, utterly leveled almost the entire medieval city (and most of the artistic works that once shined inside it). By 1333 Giotto was back in Florence, now feted as the official City Artist despite his advanced age. Indeed, the artist seems to have received his appointment from the city at precisely the moment of his retirement. Giotto managed to set down designs for the Campanile that stands next to the cathedrals faade, but those designs were so poorly executed that the project was halted and re-configured out of fear that Giottos building would completely collapse. Other than the Campanile project, Giotto pursued practically no other commissions during this final stage of his career, and it may well be that his post a City Artist was actually an administrative post (or, just as likely, merely an honorific title), and that his real job was to delegate (or even sub-contract) important commissions to younger artists like Bernardo Daddi and Andrea Pisano. Yet Giottos legacy cannot be exaggerated. His approach to naturalistic figures and believable narratives catapulted Florentine art from the stodgy and predictable effigies painted by thirteenth-century artisans, deeply wedded to elongated and stylized Byzantine traditions, to a vibrant and animated visual environment that valued energy, emotional content, and gestural drama. His conveyance of mystical sublimity in The Stigmatization of St. Francis at the top of the Bardi Chapel, for example, succeeds due to the recognizable anatomical form that emerges from underneath Francis garment and the unrelenting facial expression of the elderly friar confronting his God. The emotionally fraught image of Franciss followers who mourn his death in the Burial of St. Francis inside the chapel counters this image by placing around the dead saint a collection of tormented men, each one lost in his own psychological state of grief and each one contributing to the broader emotional environment created by this Greek Chorus of unified anguish, all of which has been depicted through the furrowed brows and downturned lips and thrusting hands of otherwise anonymous clerics. No one had ever seen paintings quite like this before, and their impact was immediate and pervasive, as evidenced by the legion of imitators who strove to echo his new approach to pictorial naturalism. Giottos innovative spirit captured the imagination of writers during and after his lifetime. Boccaccio famously cast Giotto in a number of his tales in the Decameron from ca. 1351, making the painter out to be a sage judge of character. Francesco Sacchettis Trecento Novelle from the 1390s expanded on this literary trope by ascribing to Giotto a certain wit and wisdom that put the craftsman on par with Florences greatest minds. And Vasaris sixteenth-century story of Giottos O, a play on Pliny the Elders tales (concerning the Greek painters Apelles, Parahaxios, and Protogenes) in which the artist drew a perfect circle  free hand  before an uncomprehending papal lackey, came to be seen by modern painters (like Rembrandt van Rijn) as the perfect allegory of artistic dexterity. To this day, Giotto receives a kind of adulation among Italian art lovers as a groundbreaker among groundbreakers, the first of the painterly Evangelists who, along with Masaccio, Leonardo, and Michelangelo, proselytized a new approach to the visual arts. Importantly, some of Giottos stylistic and intellectual innovations were disseminated even before his death. His talented workshop almost certainly included Taddeo Gaddi and Maso di Banco, two of the most gifted painters of the fourteenth century who gained their independence and produced important works of their own as soon as Giotto left for Naples in 1328. In fact, many of the figures and scenes credited to Giottos hand in the 1310s and 20s were, in all probability, actually executed by these great masters-in-training, thanks to the tradition of workshop production that dictated a delegation of productivity among assistants on the scaffold. But even painters who did train directly with Giotto looked to his art for inspiration. Pacino di Buonaguida and Bernardo Daddi, excellent painters in their own right, quoted the details of Giottos passages with frequency and skill, even though they appear to have come from different pictorial traditions. Even after the passing of the Black Death in 1348 - a watershed event that, at least chronologically (if not psychologically), divides the late Middle Ages from the early Modern period - Giottos compositions, figures, gestures, and narrative solutions still held sway among painters like Andrea Orcagna and Nardo di Cione, Niccol di Pietro Gerini, and even Lorenzo Monaco into the fifteenth century. Only with the advent of Masaccio, the first painter of the Quattrocento to truly understand Giotto and his approach to naturalistic representation, did artists begin to build upon the traditions he had founded in the early Trecento.

        "content"  : "Giovanni Boccaccio (1313-1375) Long considered one of the three crowns of Italian medieval writers (along with Dante and Petrarch), Giovanni Boccaccio left in his wake stories of all kinds. Born in 1313 as an illegitimate child of a merchant, Boccaccio first studied economics and trade in Naples before attempting a legal career. When he reached maturity he scorned his fathers wishes and pursued a career in literature. Unlike other authors of the day, Boccaccio strayed from emulating the poetics of Virgil and Homer and turned instead to the prose of Ovid, who was considered a more lowbrow author. An astute reader and noted scholar, Boccaccio famously performed public readings of Dantes Divine Comedy on the steps of the Badia, the Benedictine Abbey that faces the Bargello, and historians believe his decision to write in vernacular Italian arose from Dantes efforts to write poetry in the common tongue. He expanded directly on Dantes compositions and became close friends with Petrarch despite their conflicting literary topics and styles. The Decameron, Boccaccios best-known work, is a collection of one hundred tales told by ten people over ten days. Sequestered in a country palace after the outbreak of plague in 1348, seven women and three men entertain each other by telling instructive and often scandalous stories of love, religion, money, crime, and justice. As the Black Death destroys the citys everyday rhythms, these elite men and women lampoon Florences social norms, politics, and church practices in a space both physically and mentally removed from the city itself. In writing both female and male narrators into The Decameron, Boccaccio creates a new kind of communal space distinct from normal Florentine contexts. The erotic nature of some of these stories  as well as the number of female narrators in his book  suggests that Boccaccio wrote mainly for a female audience. The book became an instant success for its commentary on human life in the face of tragedy. Yet Boccaccios parody of longstanding institutions did not go unnoticed. The Index of Prohibited Books, created in 1559 as a tool for the Catholic Counter-Reformation, listed The Decameron as one of its forbidden texts, and even into the twentieth century it was known as The Dirty Stories. The Decameron and Boccaccios other works serve as some of the most valuable (and candid) primary sources about the average Florentines engagement with the citys various civic, religious, and social spaces. Scholars, authors, and artists referred not only to ancient sources but also to contemporary texts from Italy and Europe. This mixing of traditions demonstrates a consistent transformation of Florentine writing rather than a linear evolution. Boccaccios pivotal work provided different ways to read and understand Florence as a medieval city, both through its narrators and its characters. Boccaccio died in 1375 at the age of 62, but not without regrets. In his last years, the writer penned letters to his friend Francesco Petrarch in which he lamented the bawdiness of some of the themes in his Decameron. Those who have enjoyed his tales since their publication have not shared Boccaccios concerns. Bibliography Boccaccio, Giovanni. The Decameron. New York: Oxford Worlds Classics, 2008.

Maria degli Angeli in 1390, probably after completing his formative education as an apprentice/assistant in a painters workshop. After a quick rise through the ranks, during which time he was ordained a deacon, the monk left his cloister five years later to re-enter the secular world as a painter, producing miniatures in choral books for his former monastic home between about 1396 and 1399. He then turned his attention to large altarpieces and liturgical panels for religious institutions, like the now-lost altarpiece for a confraternity in S. Maria del Carmine and the Agony in the Garden that may have adorned a pier in Orsanmichele. He went on to paint some of the citys most influential pictures, including the frescoes and altarpiece in S. Trinitas Bartolini-Salimbeni chapel in the late 1410s. A leader in his field, Lorenzo Monacos decorative and mystical sensibilities led him to develop stylistic trademarks that have come to be known as the Florentine Gothic. He was named the chaplain of Orsanmichele in 1412, evaluated the work of his peers, and in 1422 was the beneficiary of Medici largesse when Cosimo and his brother Lorenzo contributed significant funds for the production of a now-lost altarpiece in the hospital of S. Maria Nuova. By the time of his death in 1424 he was the undisputed standard-bearer of painting in Florence. Mostly though, Lorenzo Monaco was known for his extended relationship with his comrades in the Camaldolese monastery of S. Maria degli Angeli, located on the Via degli Alfani just around the corner from the Piazza SS. Annunziata and the Ospedale degli Innocenti. He kept his monastic name throughout his adult life and was referred to without exception as frate Lorenzo; he produced the Angelis high altarpiece of The Coronation of the Virgin, in 1413 and painted a core group of miniatures in the Graduals and antiphonaries that were commissioned alongside it; and he lived across the street from the entrance of the church in a house on the Via degli Alfani that he leased from his former cloister in 1415. When he died in 1424, the monks buried him in their cloister, bringing the famous artist home for good. There is much circumstantial evidence to suggest that, in fact, Lorenzo Monaco was asked to leave the cloister by his fellow monks in 1396 in order to provide him the opportunity to produce art works for the community that he could not otherwise produce in the cramped quarters of a monastic institution that was not set up to support the kind of painters workshop needed to produce them.

        "content"  : "Maso di Banco (ca. 1305  ca. 1350) Though he only worked for a short period in the first half of the 14th century, Maso di Banco is considered one of the greatest students of Giotto. Despite his illustrious teacher and accomplished personal career, almost no information remains about his life. Though it is known that he worked in Florence circa 1330-1350, none of his work was ever signed or dated, a fact which has furthered the mystery surrounding his brief career. The frescoes of the Bardi di Vernio Chapel in the Franciscan friary of S. Croce are the only works attributed to him without question, a tradition informed by Ghibertis early writings that describe Masos impressive skill as both a painter and sculptor, and attribute the frescoes of the chapel to him. The frescoes primarily depict scenes from the Life of St. Sylvester, but also include images of the Resurrection of Christ and the Last Judgment. The Life of St. Sylvester includes the prominent image of St. Sylvester and the Dragon on the south wall, a dramatic scene which exemplifies his clear style and illustrates the direct influence of Giotto. Both painters used a similar palette of pinks, greys, reds, and whites, as well as light and dark contrasts to convey a sense of naturalism. The legacy of Giotto can also be seen in Masos figures, which share the same individuality of expression. Credited with being more restrained and simpler that Giotto, Masos scenes dilute drama in favor of illusionistic depictions of deep space and connections to surrounding architecture. In creating these deep spaces, Maso places his figures in a way that helps suggest a certain kind of three dimensionality. These stylistic tendencies reappear in the fresco on the opposite wall of the Bardi di Vernio Chapel. In the image of the Resurrection on the north wall, Maso placed the painted figure of the Resurrected Christ rising up over a sculpted tomb, making it seem as though the event happens before our eyes. This blending of art and its setting allows for a consistent narrative, further fueling the story and the importance of its characters, which in turn enhances the holiness of the space. The little information we have about Maso includes the mention of him in guild records and registers, such as his matriculation into the Arte de Medici e Speziali guild in 1346 and the appearance of his name in the Register of the Compagnia di S. Luca in 1350. But there is no mention of him at any time after this. Given this lack of documentation, Maso di Bancos legacy relies chiefly on Ghibertis accounts of his skill and range, his status as a pupil of Giotto, and most importantly his frescoes in the Bardi di Vernio Chapel.

        "content"  : "Nardo di Cione (died c. 1366) Nardo di Cione partnered with his brother, Andrea di Cione, to form one of the most successful and influential artistic workshops in post-plague Florence. Particularly gifted in the realm of fresco painting, Nardos works adorned a wide array of institutions across the city, and the famous letter of 1349 lists him (as well as his fraternal colleague) as one of the best painters working in Florence at the time. Most of Nardos life was lived in the parish of S. Michele Visdomini, the neighborhood abutting the cathedral to the north that was heavily populated by painters. But near the end of his life, Nardo moved closer to S. Maria Novella, at the citys west end. He died there in 1365 and, like his older brother, he seems to have felt a spiritual tug that caused him to bequeath to the Company of the Misericordia a decent sum of money in his will, one of a number of documents pertaining to his life and legacy that have been discovered in the Florentine Archives. Nardos earliest works may have been produced in the nave of the Franciscan church of S. Croce, where Andrea di Cione appears to have led a large-scale project to paint a vast image of the Last Judgment on the south wall of the nave. He then seems to have worked inside the headquarters of the Arte della Lana, the Wool Guild, where we still see an image of the Judgment of Brutus that adorns the north wall of the Audience Hall. After surviving the Black Death of 1348, Nardo was engaged in the complicated fresco cycle of the Last Judgment in the recently constructed chapel in the transept of S. Maria Novella that was maintained by the Strozzi Family. He painted frescoes in the Bigallo as well, and even produced modestly-sized devotional triptychs for private viewers, like the one in Washingtons National Gallery, and altarpieces for local churches, like the Trinity and Madonna and Child Enthroned for the Chapterhouse of the Camaldolese monastery of S. Maria degli Angeli. Nardos stylistic approach matches that of his brother, Andrea. His proportionally accurate figures exert a kind of volumetric heft thats articulated by subtle suggestions of light that move across draperies undulating over bodies. Facial features suggest stoic rigor, and often include furrowed brows and drooping lips surrounded by white whiskers. The throats of his male characters in particular often bulge with shaded muscles that converge in a V pattern around the Adams Apple. Nardos stylistic choices influenced generations of painters  including such popular figures as Niccol di Pietro Gerini, Giovanni del Biondo, and his younger brother Jacopo di Cione. Even the florid brushwork of Lorenzo Monaco, the great painter of the early fifteenth century, can be considered as a form of dialogue with the approaches taken by Nardo di Cione. Bracketed by the sparkling innovative spirit of Giotto and the equally transformative approach of Masaccio, Nardo di Cione and his mid-fourteenth-century peers often get overlooked when considering the grand sweep of Italian art in the early Renaissance period. But his adoption of the tenets of the older artist, combined with his own nuanced sense of spiritual rigor, formed a transitional bridge between the early fourteenth century and the fifteenth in ways that cannot be over-emphasized.

        "content"  : "Niccolo Gerini (ca. 13401416) Niccol di Pietro Gerini is not a household name today. His conservative style extended the innovations of Giotto and the traditions of Bernardo Daddi, but a full century after the advent of this new style of painting reached the vantage point of Florentine viewers. However, at the height of his career at the turn of the fifteenth century, few painters in Tuscany enjoyed the kind of popularity that he did among patrons and audiences alike. We know nothing of his origins, his training, or his demeanor, but the archives do tell us that both his father and his son were also painters. It stands to reason that the family members worked together as a team for over one hundred years. For his part, Niccol matriculated into the Guild of Doctors and Apothecaries in 1368 at a time when he was involved in collaboration with Jacopo di Cione to paint now-lost frescoes in the vaults of the residence hall of the Florentine Guild of Lawyers, Judges, and Notaries. He may also have assisted on two additional works completed by Jacopo  the two Coronations of the Virgin for S. Pier Maggiore and the Florentine Mint, respectively  but the Niccolaio listed in documents related to these commissions may instead refer to the painter Niccol di Tommaso. He painted a large dossal of the Entombment of Christ currently in the oratory of S. Carlino, just across the street from the more famous guild church of Orsanmichele. He teamed with Ambrogio di Baldese in 1386 to paint the fresco of the Abandonment and Restitution of Children on the faade of the Bigallo, and two years later completed a beautiful triptych of the Baptism of Christ for an altar in the dormitory of the Camaldolese monastery of S. Maria degli Angeli. Soon thereafter he went to the nearby town of Prato to paint frescoes in the Palazzo Datini and the church of S. Francesco, and then worked in Pisa at the church of S. Francesco before returning to Florence to paint the frescoes in the Sacristy of S. Croce. Two haunting paintings of the Man of Sorrows  one for the Flagellant Confraternity of Ges Pellegrino that operated out of S. Maria Novella and the other for an unknown setting  remind us of the severity of devotional practices during the decades following the Black Death of 1348 and its periodic reappearances. A number of other paintings have been attributed to his hand, like two street tabernacles that still stand on the Via dei Malcontenti and the Via delle Bella Donne, but this is speculative. However, documents from Orsanmichele confirm that in 1409 Niccol di Pietro Gerini painted in fresco the effigies of a number of guild patron saints that still adorn the columns inside the former grain repository today. Gerinis approach to painting clearly demonstrates an affinity for the rather hard and massive forms popularized by Andrea Orcagna di Cione and his brother, Nardo di Cione, both of whom followed closely the traditions formulated by their probable master, Bernardo Daddi. Gerinis lively compositions often revolved around narrative themes, sometimes invented from whole cloth by the artist: the Abandonment and Restitution of Children on the Bigallo and the Man of Sorrows in S. Maria Novella include references to contemporary people and practices that the artist either witnessed for himself or imagined in the design phase of the process. His color palette, filled with rich blues, greens, and vermilions, creates decorative patterns of unusual complexity and aesthetic brilliance. But his adherence to traditional representations of space, generic renderings of anatomical forms, and time-tested religious iconography make his impact on contemporaries and later generations minimal at best. Indeed, the advent of Lorenzo Monaco in the early fifteenth century and the arrival on the scene of Masaccio in 1422 swayed other Florentine painters away from Niccols precedents, even though both Lorenzo and (to a lesser degree) Masaccio owed Gerini some important artistic debts. But for an important chunk of time between about 1380 and about 1405, Niccol di Pietro Gerini was a leading artist in a city filled with capable competitors. Bibliography Arthur, Kathleen Giles.

        "content"  : "Taddeo Gaddi (ca. 1290-1366) Taddeo Gaddi, born circa 1290, is often described as one of the most talented artists and builders living in Florence during the medieval era. Heralded as one of Giottos most able pupils, Gaddi exuded a reverence for his masters stylistic technique and sought to follow the artistic method of his teacher. Sometimes this resulted in a kind of imitative quality that caused Giorgio Vasari to comment harshly on Gaddis aping of Giottos aesthetic, stating (Gaddi) always continued Giottos manner without improving it, a backwards compliment that suggests a slavish imitation on the part of Taddeo Gaddi. Despite working in the shadow of his famous master, Gaddi enjoyed a successful career in art, opening his own shop and receiving some of the most lucrative commissions in all of Florence. One such commission came from the Franciscan friary in the city, where Taddeo Gaddi was assigned as chief decorator for the groups main worship center, the Basilica of Santa Croce. This ornate building contains important works by Gaddi, including his frescoes of the Tree of Life on the west wall of the conventual Refectory, quatrefoil panels of the Life of Francis that ornamented a large cabinet, and murals for the Cappella Baroncelli (1328-1330). Annunciation and visitation scenes align the altar walls of this latter space, and the large murals present themselves to viewers in grand fashion. Iconographically, these paintings are unmistakably evocative of Giottos work in the Arena Chapel at Padua (ca. 1305) and this imitation showcases Gaddis ceaseless reliance on his teacher as a fountain for inspiration. Despite Vasaris critique, Gaddi did not merely imitate Giottos style, but managed to advance his masters groundbreaking achievements: his ability to utilize natural light and rich hues to achieve perfect representations of color, seen in the Baroncelli Adoration of the Magi, displays Gaddis mastery of the color wheel that surpasses even that of Giottos. Until his death in 1366 Taddeo Gaddi was one of the most influential men in Florentine artistic culture. Despite being viewed as a simple follower of Giotto, Taddeo triumphantly surpassed his liege in the methodology of colors and light. His work in the Basilica Santa Croce provides a canonical viewing of Gaddis copycat style while also underscoring his heightened proficiency with color. Bibliography Gardner, Julian.

Cited as Missirini, S. Remigio, 1839. NAME S. Romeo: probably a dialectical distortion (1). BUILDING HISTORY The church of the holy Archbishop from Reims is probably from the time period of the French rule, so it was created in the late 8th or 9th century (2). It first served as lodgings for french pilgrims to Rome (3), but it was changed into a canonical monastery right before 1040 (4). In the Romanesque time, it apparently experienced changes and extensions (5). In the Gothic time, it was radically redesigned. The point in time can only be roughly estimated. It is possible that the extension of the forecourt, documented in 1303, was already connected to the conversion plan (6); the pier and vault seem to have been first constructed around 1350 (7). The windows of the side walls were expanded in the 15th century (8). In 1568 or 1581, the church was awarded the priority title (9). Subsequently, the Gothic style and the canon chancel blocking the center aisle was removed, and the choir stalls were moved to the middle choral chapel. At the same time, the staircase in front of the three choir chapels was redesigned and an organ loft with new side doors was installed (10). The final consecration took place in 1589 (11). The bell tower and the canonry were also built at that time (12). In the early 17th century, the inside room received a sequence of architectural altar tabernacles (13). In 1821, the outside walls were cleaned, and the portals were painted black and white according to the model of the medieval Florentine marble incrustations (14). At that time, the new Gothic window of the left choral chapel was created. RECONSTRUCTION OF THE ORIGINAL BUILDINGS The Carolingian Pilgrim Hospital, 8th/9th Century Form unknown.  Perhaps the older of the two reconstructed churches in the following section is identical with the hospital church. The Romanesque Church; 11th/12th Century remnants. A Romanesque side portal with a round arch and architrave has been preserved in the faade to the right of the main portal, together with a small wall segment; the round arch was partially removed later, so that a protective roof could be installed above it. A second Romanesque remnant is the eastern third of the northern side wall. It contains a narrow window, whose round arch is carved out of a stone in a strikingly ancient manner, in lieu of showing the wedge stone construction of the faade portal. Conclusions. We also recognized possible remnants of the two different churches in both of these wall segments. The older one (with the window) could have originated in the early 11th century and the younger one around the 12th century  unless one prefers to place the older one in the Carolingian time period and the younger one in the 11th century. The first building must have been, in spite of the low position of the window, reconstructed as a church hall, since the wall segment reaches very far up. The second building was probably understood as an extension of the first and was, like the first, a rectangular, flat-roofed hall. It already has the dimensions of a Gothic building, because its corners coincide with the firsts corners.  Next to the chair laid the canonry. The Gothic Buildings, First Half of the 14th Century Church. Essentially preserved. The choir chapels had a narrow, high pointed arch window, as individual traces can be recognized. Similar windows were probably also added to the side walls. The canon chancel stood in the center aisle (15), probably a simple rectangular wall like the corresponding monks choirs in S. Maria Novella, S. Croce, S. Trinita, Ognissanti, etc., which were removed at the same time. Canonry. The canons living quarters were grouped to the south of the church around a cloister, of which some remnants have been preserved. As a result, the south wall of the church was exposed; like the other sides, it was decorated with a round-arched frieze (remnants in the current, extended canonry). BUILDING DESCRIPTION Church Outside. Overview. The church is rectangular in plan. The quarry stone walls of the faade and the north side contain the Romanesque remnants described in the Reconstruction section. Between these oldest parts, located at the south-west corner and the north-east corner of the church, are the uneven quarry stone walls of the Gothic reconstruction, which reveal themselves as a uniform structure due to the evenly running scaffolding holes; the rear wall and the bell tower, both with windows from the 16th and 19th centuries, also belong to this. Remnants of the plaster and paint from 1821 are on all the walls. The faade has retained its Gothic nature to some extent. Its structure - a main portal and above it three wide-open round-arched windows, of which the central one is emphasized by its particular size and finer profiling, as well as a (renovated) round-arched frieze on the low gable - is inspired by the faade of S. Stefano. The only somewhat distinct motif, the main portal, has a pointed arch above a console-supported architrave; it is too generally stylized to allow a more exact positioning. North wall. Its windows appear to have been extended at a later date. Inside. Illustrations. Floor plan and interior views by Supino, Gli albori etc. 1906, 131 and panel XXVIII. Framework. Three-nave, three-bay pseudo-basilica with triangular choral chapels; pillars, pilasters, pointed arches and ribbed vaults everywhere. The walls are made of quarry stone, the limbs of house stone (Macigno). Floor plan. Center aisle bays are square and side aisle bays are longitudinal rectangular - as in S. Maria Maggiore. The main choir chapel is transversely rectangular. Side choirs are square, and all three choirs are closed off by a uniform straight rear wall - similar to Arnolfos Badia. Structure. A hall-like pseudo-basilica - like in S. Maria Maggiore. Similarly to S. Maria Maggiore, in the central nave, pilaster-like short wall attachments rise above the pillar capitals up to the vaults, which are set slightly higher than in the side aisles. The central nave pillars are octagonal - like in S. Croce; their capitals have coarsely embossed two-row acanthus leaves. The free pillars correspond to the walls and the pilasters on the chapel opening - again like in S. Maria Maggiore; however, in this church, they are not polygonal and are instead flat and pilaster-like. The profile of the bases of the pillars and pilasters is also unique: a slant above a slab, so its a very concise, austere formulation. Between the side aisle vaults, the chords reach down strikingly low, similar to those in S. Maria Novella (16); the five-sided polygonal cross-section of the ribs was also prefigured in the Dominican church, whereas the five-sided pyramid shape of the consoles below was found in S. Croce. - The curved staircase in front of the choir chapels dates from 1589 - Overall effect: coarse and unoriginal; the church appears to be the work of an eclectic who adopted motifs from all the more important Gothic buildings in the city and followed S. Maria Maggiore particularly closely. Decoration. The sparse architectural forms are enlivened with figures in a few places: heads on the capital of the second left-hand pillar and half-figures of St. Remigius on the keystone of the last nave bay. Originally, a decorative fresco painting would have made the room appear somewhat less sober. The altar tabernacles with its Tuscan half-columns and its fragmented segmental pediments only reveal the frigid style of the 17th century through their ornamentation. They are said to have been made in Rome (cf. fn. 13) and are unified with the windows that were extended in the Quattrocento. Canonry. A Trecento cloister with octagonal pillars stretches along the south wall of the church. Segmental arches and square, ribless cross vaults. The first bay of its west wing has also been preserved. Above and next to it are the living quarters, which reveal themselves as the result of the extension of 1589 through many doors decorated with coats of arms. DECOR CHURCH Outside. Facade.

Rosselli in Sepoltuario assumes that the popular name is an alteration of the word Romeo, which was used to designate the French Rome pilgrims (cf. Baugeschichte; Richa I, 1754, 254; Biadi, Fabbr., 1824, 28). Perhaps S. Romeo is more likely to have developed from the French form of the saints name - S. Rmy (2) History of Florence I, 1896, 89. Missirini, S. Remigio, 1839, 2: allegedly founded in the year 800. N (3) Richa I, 1754, 254, 256 (according to Rossellis Sepoltuario, which used old documents from 1040). Lami, Mon. II, 1758, 1059; Fantozzi, Guida, 1842, 158: History of Florence I, 1896, 89; - Richas assumption (I, 1754, 255) that S. Remigio was elevated to parish church status when the second ring of walls was erected in 1078 was already refuted by Fantozzi, Guida, 1842, 158, with a reference to the wording of the document of 1040; cf. also Missirini, S. Remigio, 1839, 5, 6. (4) Poccianti, vite desette Beati Fiorentini etc. 1589, 182; Missirini, S. Remigio, 1839, 4. (5) cf. Building description (6) Deed with Richa I, 1754, 257; Missirini, S. Remigio, 1839, 12. (7) Coat of arms. The coats of arms of the Bagnesi, Pepi and Alberti families are carved into the vault keystones, pillars and pilasters. Rosselli writes in his Sepoltuario that Piero del Bene Pepi, who is named on the first southern pillar, was a member of the College of Priors in 1350. Richa I, 1754, 260 still saw the tombstone of this Piero; Cocchi, Chiese, 1903, 136, 137). The date made probable by this would be consistent with the fact that the foliage of the coat of arms in the corresponding first pillar (Bagnesi) could hardly have been created before the middle of the Trecento; of course, this coat of arms is carved from a special stone and set into the pillar, but not chiseled into it. However, very similar stem and tendril forms can also be found on the keystone of the second bay in the left aisle. The quatrefoil frame on the coats of arms above the entrance to the right choral chapel also suggests a late date. The figurative architectural sculptures - small heads on the leaf ends of the second pillar capital on the left and the half-figure of Remigius in the keystone of the last nave bay in front of the choir - are too rough to allow a more precise dating. In addition to the opinion expressed here, some older, divergent assumptions should be mentioned. Richa I, 1754, 258, passes on an opinion, one that can probably be explained by the similarity of the two churches. According to this opinion, the legendary builders of S. Maria Novella, Fra Sisto and Fra Ristoro, had borrowed the plan for S. Maria Novella from S. Remigio; Fantozzi, Guida, 1842, 159, reversed the relationship between the two buildings, but moved S. Remigio down to 1428. Remigio to 1428, on which Marchese, Memorie domenicane, 1854, 35, stated that the architecture of the church unequivocally spoke against such a late origin and spoke in favor of placing it in the time period of S. Maria Novella. Milanesi (Vasari I, 655) balanced the pros and cons of this line of thought by saying that the connection of S. Remigio with S. Maria Novella and its architects was not proven in any case. In the meantime, the author of Notizie e guida di Firenze, 1841, 309, 310 had put forward the equally contestable thesis that the church came from the school of Arnolfo di Cambio, followed by Jacob Burckhardt, Cicerone I, 1860, 142 and the Cicerone editors (Cicerone II, 1901, 10). Biadi, Fabbr., 1824, 48 dated the building to the 13th century. Supino, Gli Albori etc., 1906, 130 in the 14th century. Cocchi, Chiese, 1903, 136, 137 added the date 1350, which I analyzed. Paatz, Werden und Wesen der Trecentoarchitektur in Toskana, 1937, 161 fn. 149. G. Marchini, Rivista dArte XX, 1938, 108 mentions the church as an example of how Gothic architectural forms were Italianized in Florence. (8) The fact that the windows were subsequently extended is revealed by the younger brickwork surrounding them. The date of the extension can be deduced from the character of the stained-glass and coats of arms on the north side (late 15th century). (9) Richa I, 1754, 257 f.; Lami, Mon. II, 1758, 1015.  cf. also Richa II, 1755, 15 (1581). (10) Vasari (first edition, 1550, 190 and second edition, 1568, I, 191) still saw the medieval canon choir. The organ was dated in 1583 with an inscription, and the staircase is generally and correctly associated with the removal of the monks choir, which was also carried out in other churches at the time (Richa I, 1754, 259). The side doors also prove to be products of this construction period due to their stylistic forms. - The staircase was donated by the Bagnesi (Richa I, 1754, 258), as was a pulpit. (11) According to the inscription in the left aisle: Richa I, 1754, 257, 258 - Cocchi, Chiese, 1903, 138 erroneously gives the date 1568. (12) Cf. Building description (13) These tabernacles were obtained from Rome: Richa I, 1754, 259; Fantozzi, Guida, 1842, 159, 160. (14) Biadi, Fabbr., 1824, 48, 49.

Maria Novella, which has been overemphasized in the literature, is limited to this (cf. fn. 7) (17) Fantozzi, Guida, 1842, 159; the painter is not mentioned in Thieme-Becker. (18) According to the parish priest, the reliquaries were taken from S. Jacopo traFossi when it was abolished. Garneri, 1924, 170 mentions the altarpiece, which had long since disappeared (cf. Verl. Ausst.). (20) Richa I, 1754, 258. (21) Biadi, Fabbr., 1825, 49: transferred here from the faade wall in 1821. Fantozzi, Guida, 1842, 160, 161. Cruttwell, Churches, 1908, 236: Byzantine, 14th century.

Cruttwell, Churches, 1908, 236, 237: in the Uffizi since 1842. -The Maso-Giottino question. There are doubts as to whether Vasaris Giottino and Giottos pupil Maso (reported by Ghiberti) were the same person, and whether both the works mentioned by Vasari and the Sylvester frescoes in S. Croce, authenticated by Ghiberti for Maso, could be attributed to this master. These doubts have gradually led modern scholars to distinguish between two masters, the older Maso, who lived in the first half of the 14th century (main work: the frescoes of St. Sylvester) and a younger painter, perhaps called Giottino, who lived in the second half of the 14th century. Fundamental for this recognition was the work of Suida, Rep. f. Kw. XXVII, 1904, 483 ff., Month. f. Kw. I, 2, 1908, 1009 ff. and VII, 1914, 1 ff.; cf. also Schlosser, Art historical Jb. of the. k. k. Central commission IV, 1910, 198 f. While Suida does not comment on the Lamentation in the above-mentioned works, Schlosser, op. cit., declares it not to be by the hand of the painter of the Sylvester frescoes, but to be a work by Giottino, perhaps restored in 1392 by Niccol di Pietro Gerini (cf. S. Pier Maggiore, p. 642, and fn. 82). Rintelen, Art historical. Displays, 1906, 43 had declared it to be an Upper Italian work from around 1400. Since Wulff, Rep. f. Kw. XXIX, 1906, 477, it has usually been regarded as a mature work by the master of the Sylvester frescoes. This opinion has persisted for a long time (although this painter is often called Giottino at first, later mostly Maso, depending on the attitude of the scholars). Thus, for example, Venturi, Storia V, 1907, 499 f.; Sirn, Giottino, 1908, 4, 46 ff. and Giotto and  followers, 1917, 195, 209 ff.; Thieme-Becker XIV, 1921, 93; van Marle III, 1924, 412, 418; Sirn, Dedalo VIII, 1927/28, 412. Recently there has been a tendency to move the painting away from the Sylvester frescoes and attribute it to a younger painter, perhaps Giottino Vasari. Thus, Longhi, Pinacotheca, 1928, 143/44 and fn. 1 and Critica dArte 25/26, 1941, 180 fn. 4; Offner, Burl. Mag. LIV, 1929, 230, fn. 10 L. Colletti, Riv. dA.

(36) Richa I, 1754, 258; Bindi, Fabbr., 1824, 49: removed in 1821. Missirini, S. Remigio, 1839, 9 (probably erroneously) mentions it as still existing. (37) Richa I, 1754, 259; LAntiquario fiorentino, 1771, 57; Foll.-Rastr. V, 1794, 155. No longer mentioned by Biadi, Fantozzi and the more recent sources. Removed during the restoration of 1821? The only evidence against this is the mention in the Guida of 1841 (p. 310), but this could be explained by the uncritical adoption of older descriptions.

Zitiert als Missirini, S. Remigio, 1839. NAME S. Romeo: wohl mundartliche Enstellung (1). BAUGESCHICHTE Die Kirche des heiligen Erzbischofs von Reims ist wahrscheinlich zur Zeit der frnkischen Herrschaft, also im spten 8. Oder 9. Jahrhundert, gegrndet worden (2). Sie diente zuerst als Herberge fr frnkische Rompilger (3), wurde aber bereits vor 1040 in ein Kanonikerstift verwandelt (4). Noch in romanischer Zeit erfuhr sie anscheinend Vernderungen und Erweiterungen (5). In gotischer Zeit wurde sie eingreifend umgestaltet. Der Zeitpunkt lsst sich nur ungefhr angeben. Mglich, dass schon die urkundlich fr 1303 beglaubigte Erweiterung des Vorplatzes mit dem Umbauplan in Zusammenhang stand (6); die Pfeiler und Gewlbe scheinen jedoch erst gegen 1350 errichtet zu sein (7). Die Fenster der Seitenwnde wurden im 15. Jahrhundert erweitert. 1568 oder 1581 wurde der Kirche der Prioreititel verliehen (9). Anschlieend beseitigte man den gotischen, das Mittelschiff versperrenden Kanonikerchor und verlegte das Chorgesthl in die mittlere Chorkapelle, indem man zugleich die Treppe vor den drei Chorkapellen umgestaltete und eine Orgelempore samt neuen Seitentren anbrachte (10). Die Schlussweihe fand 1589 statt (11). Auch der Glockenturm und das Kanonikat sind damals ausgebaut worden (12). Im frhen 17. Jahrhundert erhielt der Innenraum eine Folge von architektonischen Altartabernakeln (13). 1821 wurden die Auenmauern verputzt und die Portalleibungen nach dem Vorbild der mittelalterlichen Florentiner Marmorinkrustationen schwarzwei bemalt (14). Damals entstand auch das neugotische Fenster der linken Chorkapelle. REKONSTRUKTION VERLORENER BAUZUSTNDE Das karolingische Pilgerhospital; 8./9. Jahrhundert. Gestalt unbekannt. Vielleicht ist die ltere der beiden im folgenden Abschnitt rekonstruierten Kirchen mit der Spital-Kirche identisch. Die romanische Kirche; 11./12. Jahrhundert. Reste. In der Fassade hat sich rechts neben dem Hauptportal ein romanisches Seitenportal mit Rundbogen und Architrav erhalten, zusammen mit einem kleinen Mauerstck; der Rundbogen ist spter zum Teil abgearbeitet worden, um ein Schutzdach darber anbringen zu knnen. Ein zweiter romanischer Rest ist das stliche Drittel der nrdlichen Seitenmauer. Es enthlt ein schmales Fenster, dessen Rundbogen in auffallend altertmlicher Weise aus einem Stein herausgemeielt ist, anstatt die Keilsteinkonstruktion des Fassadenportals zu zeigen. Schlussfolgerungen. Wir haben also in diesen beiden Mauerstcken vielleicht Reste zweier verschiedener Kirchen zu erkennen. Der ltere (mit dem Fenster) knnte im frhen 11. Jahrhundert entstanden sein, der jngere etwa im 12. Jahrhundert  falls man es nicht vorzieht, den lteren in karolingische Zeit und den jngeren ins 11. Jahrhundert zu setzen. Der erste Bau muss trotz der niedrigen Lage des Fensters als eine Saalkirche rekonstruiert werden, da das Mauerstck sehr weit hinaufreicht. Der zweite Bau ist wohl als eine Erweiterung des ersten zu verstehen und wird wie dieser ein rechteckiger, flachgedeckter Saal gewesen sein. Er hatte bereits die Abmessungen des gotischen Baus, denn seine Ecken fallen mit dessen Ecken zusammen.  Neben der Kirche lag das Kanonikat. Die gotischen Bauten; 1. H. 14. Jahrh. Kirche. Im Wesentlichen erhalten. Die Chorkapellen hatten je ein schmales, hohes Spitzbogen-Fenster, wie einzelne Spuren erkennen lassen. hnliche Fenster sind wohl auch in den Seitenwnden zu ergnzen. Im Mittelschiff stand der Kanonikerchor (15), wahrscheinlich ein einfaches Mauerrechteck wie die entsprechenden, gleichzeitig beseitigten Mnchschre in S. Maria Novella, S. Croce, S. Trinita, Ognissanti usw. Kanonikat. Die Wohnrume der Kanoniker gruppierten sich sdlich von der Kirche um einen Kreuzgang, von dem sich einige Reste erhalten haben. Die Sdwand der Kirche lag infolgedessen frei; sie war wie die anderen Seiten mit einem Rundbogenfries geschmckt (Reste im jetzigen, erweiterten Kanonikat). BAUBESCHREIBUNG Kirche Auen bersicht. Die Kirche ist im Grundri rechteckig. Die Bruchsteinmauern der Fassade und der Nordseite enthalten die romanischen Reste, die im Abschnitt Rekonstruktion beschrieben worden sind. Zwischen diesen ltesten, bei der Sdwestecke und der Nordostecke der Kirche gelegenen Teilen erstreckt sich das ungleichmige Bruchstein-Gemuer des gotischen Umbaus, das sich durch die gleichmig durchlaufenden Gerstlcher als eine einheitliche Anlage verrt; zugehrig auch die Rckwand und der Glockenturm, beide mit Fenstern aus dem 16. und 19. Jahrhundert. An allen Wnden Reste des Putzes und der Bemalung von 1821. Die Fassade hat ihren gotischen Charakter einigermaen bewahrt. Ihre Gliederung  ein Hauptportal und darber drei weitgeffnete Rundbogenfenster, von denen das mittlere durch besondere Gre und feinere Profilierung hervorgehoben ist, sowie ein (erneuerter) RUndbogenfries am niedrigen Giebel  ist von der Fassade von S. Stefano angeregt. Das einzige etwas ausgeprgte Motiv, das Hauptportal, hat einen Spitzbogen ber einem konsolengetragenen Architrav; es ist zu allgemein stilisiert, um eine genauere Ansetzung zu erlauben. Nordwand. Ihre Fenster scheinen nachtrglich erweitert zu sein. Innen Abbildungen. Grundriss und Innenansichten bei Supino, Gli albori etc. 1906, 131 und Tafel XXVIII. System. Dreischiffige dreijochige Pseudobasilika mit dreieckigen Chorkapellen; allenthalben Pfeiler, Wandpfeiler, Spitzbgen und Kreuzrippengewlbe. Die Mauern bestehen aus Bruchstein, die Glieder aus Haustein (Macigno). Grundriss. Mittelschiffsjoche quadratisch, Seitenschiffsjoche lngsrechteckig  wie in S. Maria Maggiore. Hauptchorkapelle quer rechteckig. Nebenchre quadratisch, alle drei Chre von einer einheitlichen geraden Rckwand abgeschlossen  hnlich wie in Arnolfos Badia. Aufbau. Hallenartig psuedobasilikal  wie in S. Maria Maggiore. Wie dort steigen im Mittelschiff ber den Pfeilerkapitellen pilasterartige kurze Wandvorlagen bis zu den Gewlben auf, die etwas hher ansetzen als in den Seitenschiffen. Die Mittelschiffspfeiler sind achteckig  wie in S. Croce; ihre Kapitelle haben derb bossiertes zweireihiges Akanthusblatt. Den Frepfeilern entsprechen an den Wnden und an den Kapellenffnungen Wandpfeiler  wiederum wie in S. Maria Maggiore; sie sind hier aber nicht polygonal, sondern pilasterartig flach. Individuell wirkt auch das Profil der Basen der Pfeiler und Wandpfeiler: eine Schrge ber einer Platte, also eine sehr knappe, herbe Formulierung. Zwischen den Seitenschiffsgewlben reichen die Gurte auffallend tief herab, hnlich wie in S. Maria Novella (16); auch der fnfseitig-polygonale Querschnitt der Rippen war in der Dominikanerkirche vorgebildet, die fnfseitige Pyramidengestalt der darunter befindlichen Konsolen dagegen in S. Croce.  Die geschwungene Treppe vor den Chorkapellen stammt von 1589.  Gesamtwirkung: derb und unoriginell; die Kirche scheint das Werk eines Eklektikers zu sein, der von allen bedeutenderen gotischen Bauten der Stadt Motive bernahm und sich besonders eng an S. Maria Maggiore anschloss. Dekoration. Die sprlichen architektonischen Formen sind an einigen wenigen Stellen figrlich belebt: am Kapitell des zweiten linken Pfeilers Kpfe, am Schlustein des letzten Mittelschiffsjochs Halbfigure des heiligen Remigius. Ursprnglich wird eine Freskobemalung dekorativer Art den Raum etwas weniger nchtern haben erscheinen lassen. Die Altartabernakel mit ihren toskanischen Halbsulen und ihren fragmentierten Segment-Giebeln lassen nur durch ihre Ornamentik den frieren Stil des 17. Jahrhunderts erkennen. Sie sollen in Rom gearbeitet worden sein (vgl. Anm. 13) und sind mit den im Quattrocento erweiterten Fenstern einheitlich zusammengeschlossen. Kanonikat An der Sdwand der Kirche entlang streckt sich ein verbauter Trecento-Kreuzgang mit achteckigen Pfeilern. Segmentbgen und quadratischen, rippenlosen Kreuzgewlben. Auch das erste Joch seines Westflgels hat sich erhalten. Darber und daneben die Wohnrume, die sich durch viele wappengeschmckte Tren als Ergebnis der Erweiterung von 1589 verraten.

Rosselli im Sepoltuario vermutet, der volkstmliche Name sei eine Verstmmelung des Wortes Romeo, mit dem man die franzsischen Rompilger bezeichnet habe (vgl. Baugeschichte; Richa I, 1754, 254; Biadi, Fabbr., 1824, 28). Vielleicht ist S. Romeo eher aus der franzsischen Form des Heiligennamens  S. Rmy  entwickelt. (2) Geschichte von Florenz I, 1896, 89. Missirini, S. Remigio, 1839, 2: gegrndet angeblich im Jahre 800. (3) Richa I, 1754, 254, 256 (nach Rossellis Sepoltuario, das alte Urkunden vom Jahre 1040 benutzte). Lami, Mon. II, 1758, 1059. Fantozzi, Guida, 1842, 158: Geschichte von FLorenz I, 1896, 89.  Richas Vermutung (I, 1754, 255), S. Remigio sei bei Errichtung des zweiten Mauerrings im Jahre 1078 zur Pfarrkirche erhoben worden, wurde bereits von Fantozzi, Guida, 1842, 158 mit einem Hinweis auf den Wortlaut der Urkunde von 1040 widerlegt; vgl. auch Missirini, S. Remigio, 1839, 5, 6. (4) Poccianti vite desette Beati Fiorentini etc. 1589, 182; Missirini, S. Remigio, 1839, 4. (5) vgl. Die Baubeschreibung (6) Urkunde bei Richa I, 1754, 257; Missirini, S. Remigio, 1839, 12. (7) Wappen. In den Gewlbeschlusteinen, Pfeilern und Pilastern finden sich die Wappen der Familien Bagnesi, Pepi und Alberti eingemeielt. Rosselli schreibt in seinem Sepltuario, dass Piero del bene Pepi, der sich auf dem ersten sdlichen Pfeiler nennt, 1350 Mitglied des Priorenkollegiums gewesen sei (Richa I, 1754, 260 sah noch den Grabstein dieses Piero; Cocchi, CHiese, 1903, 136, 137). Zu dem dadurch wahrscheinlich gemachten Datum wrde stimmen, dass das Laubwerk des Wappens im entsprechenden ersten Wandpfeiler (Bagnesi) kaum vor der Mitte des Trecento entstanden sein drfte; freilich ist dieses Wappen aus einem besonderen Stein gearbeitet und in den Pfeiler eingelassen, nicht aber in ihn eingemeielt. Doch kommen ganz hnliche Stengel-und Rankenformen auch auf dem Schlustein des zweiten Joches im linken Seitenschiff vor. Fr eine spte Datierung spricht auch der Vierparahmen an den Wappen ber dem Eingang der rechten Chorkappelle. Die figrlichen Bauskulpturn  kleine Kpfe an den Blatttenden des zweiten Pfeilerkapitells links und die Halbfigur des Remigius im Schlustein des letzten Mittelschiffjoches vor dem Chor  sind zu roh, um eine genauere Datierung zu erlaube. Neben der hier vertretenen Meinung sind einige ltere, abweichende Vermutungen zu nennen. Richa I, 1754, 258 berliefert eine wohl durch die hnlichkeit der beiden Kirchen zu erklrende Meinung, nach der die sagenhaften Erbauer von S. Maria Novella, Fra Sisto und Fra Ristoro, den Plan fr S. Maria Novella von S. Remigio entlehnt htten; Fantozzi, Guida, 1842, 159 kehrte das Verhltnis zwischen den beiden Bauten um, rckte aber S. Remigio bis 1428 herunter, worauf er sich von Marchese, Memorie domenicane, 1854, 35, sagen lassen mute, da die Architektur der Kirche unzweideutig gegen eine so spte Entstehung und fr eine Ansetzung in die Zeit von S. Maria Novella sprche. Milanesi (Vasari I, 655) brachte das Fr und Wider dieses Gedankengangs in das rechte Gleichgewicht, indem er sagte, die Verbindung von S. Remigio mit S. Maria Novella und deren Architekten sei jedenfalls nicht bewiesen. Inzwischen hatte der Verfasser der Notizie e guida di Firenze, 1841, 309, 310 die ebenso anfechtbare These aufgebracht, die Kirche stamme aus der Schule des Arnolfo di Cambio, gefolgt von Jacob Burckhardt, Cicerone I, 1860, 142 und den Cicerone-Bearbeitern (Cicerone II, 1901, 10). Biadi, Fabbr., 1824, 48 datierte den Bau ins 13. Jahrhundert. Supino, Gli Albori etc., 1906, 130 ins 14. Jahrhundert. Cocchi, Chiese, 1903, 136, 137 brachte das von mir ausgewertete Datum 1350 bei. Paatz, Werden und Wesen der Trecentoarchitektur in Toskana, 1937, 161 Anm. 149. G. Marchini, Riv. dA. XX, 1938, 108 erwhnt die Kirche als Beispiel, wie gotische Bauformen in Florenz italianisiert wurden. (8) Dass die Fenster nachtrglich erweitert wurden, verrt das jngere Backsteingemuer, mit dem sie umgeben sind. Die Zeit der Erweiterung ergibt sich aus dem Charakter der Glasgemlde und Wappen an der Nordseite (sptes 15. Jahrh.). (9) Richa I, 1754, 257 f.; Lami, Mon. II, 1758, 1015.  Vgl. auch Richa II, 1755, 15 (1581). (10) Vasari (erste Auflage, 1550, 190 und zweite Auflage, 1568, I, 191) hat den mittelalterlichen Kanonikerchor noch gesehen. Die Orgel ist inschriftlich 1583 datiert, die Treppenanlage wird allgemein richtig mit der damals auch in anderen Kirchen vorgenommenen Entfernung des Mnchschors in Zusammenhang gebracht (Richa I, 1754, 259). Auch die Seitentren erweisen sich durch ihre Stilformen als Erzeugnisse dieser Bauperiode.  Die Treppenanlage wurde von den Bagnesi gestiftet (Richa I, 1754, 258), ebenso eine Kanzel. (11) Laut Inschrift im linken Seitenschiff: Richa I, 1754, 257, 258.  Cocchi, Chiese, 1903, 138 nennt irrtmlich das Datum 1568. (12) Vgl. Baubeschreibung.

Cruttwell, Churches, 1908, 236, 237: seit 1842 in den Uffizien. Die Frage Maso-Giottino. Die Zweifel, ob der Giottino Vasaris und der Giottoschler Maso (ber den Ghiberti berichtet), ein und dieselbe Person seien und ob diesem Meister sowohl die bei Vasari genannten Werke als die von Ghiberti fr Maso beglaubigten Sylvester-Fresken in S.Croce zuzuschreiben seien, fhrten in der modernen Forschung allmhlich zur Scheidung zweier Meister, des lteren Maso, der noch in der 1. H. 14. Jahrh. lebte (Hauptwerk: die Sylvesterfresken) und eines jngeren Malers, der vielleicht Giottino hie und in der 2. H. 14. Jahrh. lebte. Grundlegend fr diese Erkenntnis waren die Arbeiten von Suida, Rep. f. Kw. XXVII, 1904, 483 ff., Monatsh. F. Kw. I, 2, 1908, 1009 ff. und VII, 1914, 1 ff.; vgl. Auch Schlosser, Kunstgeschichtliches Jb. der. k. k. Centralkommission IV, 1910, 198 f. Whrend sich Suida in den genannten Arbeiten zu der Beweinung nicht uert, erklrt sie Schlosser a. a. O. als nicht von der Hand des Malers der Sylvesterfresken, sondern fr eine vielleicht 1392 von Niccol di Pietro Gerini restaurierte Arbeit des Giottino (vgl. S. Pier Maggiore, S. 642, und Anm. 82). Rintelen, Kunstgesch. Anzeigen, 1906, 43 hatte sie fr eine oberitalienische Arbeit um 1400 erklrt. Seit Wulff, Rep. f. Kw. XXIX, 1906, 477 galt sie aber meistens als ein reifes Werk des Meisters der Sylvesterfresken. Diese Meinung hat sich lange gehalten (wobei dieser Maler zunchst oft Giottino, spter meist Maso genannt wird, je nach der Einstellung der Gelehrten). So z. B. Venturi, Storia V, 1907, 499 f.; Sirn, Giottino, 1908, 4, 46 ff. Und Giotto and  followers, 1917, 195, 209 ff.; Thieme-Becker XIV, 1921, 93; van Marle III, 1924, 412, 418; Sirn, Dedalo VIII, 1927/28, 412. Neuerdings neigt man dazu, das Bild von den Sylvesterfresken abzurcken und einem jngeren Maler, vielleicht dem Giottino Vasaris, zuzuschreiben. So Longhi, Pinacotheca, 1928, 143/44 und Anm. 1 sowie Critica dArte 25/26, 1941, 180 Anm. 4; Offner, Burl. Mag. LIV, 1929, 230, Anm. 10 L. Colletti, Riv. dA. XIII, 1931, 331 ff.

        "content"  : "Loggia Leonardo Bartolini, et.al., Loggia, 1355-1363 On January 21, 1355 (1354 o.s.) the company received a gift of territory  about twenty feet (ten braccie)  on the corner of the Piazza S. Giovanni, which they used to site construction of the open loggia that soon came to be recognized as a signature feature of the Florentine cityscape. Eight years later, a workman named Ambrogio was paid for designing, casting, and installing the intricate iron lattice work the hugs the contours of the porch and that appears to have completed the architectural project. The arches and walls bear images that mark the structure as an edifice of importance in the civic fabric of Florence. [Read More] In 1321, a wealthy magnate named Baldinaccio Adimari gifted property that he owned in his familys neighborhood to a newly formed charitable organization charged with the tasks of tending to the destitute, diseased, and disenfranchised. The building there housed the Misericordia from that time forward but, thanks to a series of additional gifts from neighbors, the company was able to expand its residence to the east and the west. Giovanni degli Albizzi Pellegrini, a member of one of the citys most powerful families, donated property adjacent to the original building in 1351, and in 1355 the addition of the twenty feet at the corner of the Corso Adimari provided the company with the area needed for the loggia that now extended to the east. From 1355 to 1360, a man named Leonardo Bartolini oversaw the construction of this loggia, which included work completed by a number of skilled laborers he subcontracted to produce details according to their areas of expertise: One Francesco Salvini received 13 gold florins for undisclosed work, while a painter named Bartolommeo earned the equivalent of 21 gold florins for his decoration of the top of the oratory  presumably its ceiling, but perhaps the walls of the upper floor of the residence. In 1363 the project was deemed complete when the so-called Ambrogio installed elaborate decorative ironwork, priced at 100 florins (but no more than that!), on the loggias western and northern arches. Although more modest in scale than some of Florences other loggias, the intimate proportions and delicate decorations of this elegant monument make the Misericordias structure one of the most beautiful in the city. Ambrogios iron grill alone distinguishes it from other such edifices in Florence, but its easy to overlook it when taking in the entirety of the building for the first time. The marble exterior forms two sides of the loggias square box, with openings on the east and north sides providing visual access to the interior. Green marble, a decorative motif borrowed from the eleventh-century facings of the Baptistery and S. Miniato, provides a subtle articulation that frames the two arches, their pendentives, and the horizontal borders at the top and bottom. Column clusters form the discrete sections of each pier and serve as supports for the loggias arches, and then spring upward toward the quadripartite vault that flowers into porchs ceiling. Twisting columns, perhaps allusions to the spiral ones said to have once adorned the interior of King Solomons temple in Jerusalem, create the illusion of movement as ones eye moves toward the interior. Foliage and rosette patterns dance across the surface of the entire white marble structure, making the loggia appear as an avant-garde welcoming center to all comers. This sense is only intensified by the figurative sculptures that decorate the faade. Within the green strips that create sections across the loggias surface appear a series of modest bas-reliefs  perhaps carved by Arnolfo Arnoldi, under the influence of Andrea Pisano  that contain in them a set of undifferentiated heavenly figures who tilt their heads back to consider images of Christ at the apex of each arch. The quatrefoil frames on the east arch contain scroll-bearing prophets from the Old Testament who flank the half-length form of the Dead Christ  the so-called Man of Sorrows  while those on the north arch feature saints from the New Testament and the Early Christian church who receive a blessing from an image of the Resurrected Christ above them. Representatives from both books of the Bible here recognize Jesus as Savior. Triangular spandrels on either side of each arch contain half-length figures of the four Cardinal Virtues: Temperance and Prudence appear above the rounded vault on loggias the east side, while Justice and Fortitude decorate that on the north. These same characters appear in Nardo di Ciones lunette fresco of The Judgment of Brutus from the middle of the 1340s that decorated the main room of the Florentine Wool Guild, just down the street, on the way to the Ponte Vecchio. The concepts that guide wise decisions and just behaviors in and in front of the Misericordia have been paired with Judeo-Christian heroes whose exemplary lives and influential texts combine to form the experiential and codified bases for fourteenth-century moral codes. The very form of the public loggia carried some symbolic importance in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Often installed for pragmatic purposes  namely to provide the public with a form of protection from soaking rains or the intense Italian sun  the loggia came to be understood as a civic structure that, even when built by private citizens, was a gift to the commune at large. For example, the Loggia dei Lenzi, situated adjacent to the Palazzo della Signoria, gave the governmental piazza an architectonic emblem of democracy, as its form, location, and function suggested an accessibility to literally anyone who wished to venture inside it. Giovanni Rucellais loggia, placed opposite his palace in the middle of the fifteenth century on the occasion of his sons marriage to Cosimo deMedicis daughter, heightened the owners sense of self-importance as he simultaneously celebrated his prominence in the city as a Medici kinsman and his role as a public servant through this donation of an architectural structure to the residents of Florence. In keeping with this signification, the loggia for the Misericordia was both a symbol of the charitable nature of the institution  both the building and the services rendered inside it were gifts to the city  and a symbol of the companys prominence in the urban environment  it was made of expensive materials, followed long-standing Florentine design traditions, and sat on prime real estate in one of the citys most important squares. Early painters of Florentine cityscapes occasionally included representations of the loggia when producing vistas of the Piazza S. Giovanni, although their renditions differed from artist to artist and from painting to painting. The building features prominently in the fresco by Niccol di Pietro Gerini and Ambrogio di Baldese that originally decorated the faade of the residence hall that faced the Baptistery, and portrayed its appearance with impressive accuracy. These artists included in their painting of 1386 the column clusters, iron grates, spandrel figures, and the rosette decoration that forms the left side of the loggias entrance that mark it as such a remarkable space, suggesting that the buildings details truly mattered to both the frescos painters and its audience. Ridolfo Ghirlandaio, by contrast, painted in 1515 a much more simplified version of the space in his predella for the Bigallo altarpiece (with figures by Alberto Arnoldi installed in 1364): the sixteenth-century artist emphasized rectilinear pilasters (rather than sculpted column clusters and spiral colonnettes) as supports for the arches, avoided the articulation of each bas-relief, and omitted the figures of the Cardinal Virtues that were sculpted in the spandrels. Even though he truncated the residence in his painting  he shows only two arched bays on the north faade instead of three  he was careful to include iron bars within the archway and the rosette plinth at its base. The late sixteenth-century aerial view of Piazza S. Giovanni by either Giorgio Vasari or the Flemish painter Jan van der Straet (a.k.a. Giovanni Stradano, a.k.a. Johannes Stradanus, d. 1605) references the loggia only through the pictorial employment of rounded arches that mark the facility as distinct from those around it, but then fails entirely to capture even a semblance of its actual appearance beyond these obvious rounded vaults. Fabio Borbottoni (d. 1902) reproduced the loggias architectural features with some accuracy when he painted his version in the late nineteenth century, but he omitted completely the sculptural elements embedded in the archways: its as though they were never installed on the buildings faade at all. GB 1363, 24 June. The captains directed the administrator to pay the painter, Bartolommeo, 62 lire, 4 sold, and 6 denari for pictures at the head of the oratory (see carte 37). 1363, 24 October. The Captains of the Misericordia  Statio Dati, Tellino Dino, Piero Borsi, Duccio di Giovanni, Ruberto Martelli  in the name of the confraternity and the company, discussed a number of things listed below. First, they discussed the work in the Oratory where one sees figures, that is on the face of the pedestal made by the master Ambrogio that is designed and made as well as is possible; for the best value, make sure we dont spend more than 100 gold florins.

Non vorrei che quanto mi accingo a fare sembrasse inutile aggiunta ad uno studio che mira sopratutto a segnare la storia di una Istituzione, tanto meno che fosse giudicato come vano lavoro di compilazione dal momento che poco o punto puo dirsi di nuovo su argomenti di cui si sono occupati studiosi quali il Ricci, il Supino, il Poggi. Ma nella nostra Firenze il soffio dellarte ha sempre talmente abbellito ogni altra manifestazione di vita, lopera di artifici talora sublimi, spesso oscuri, ma geniali sempre, si e avvicinata cosi spesso a tutte le altre umane attivita, nobilitandole e quasi elevandole in sfere superiori, che non par possibile parlare delle une, senza richiamarsi allaltra. Percio mi si conceda di soffermarmi alquanto a ricordare tutti i tesori che formarono, o fortunamente che proprio in quellanno si era unita al Bigallo e apriva la sua casa ospitale ai crociati fratelli di fede. Tale sede pero divenuta ben presto troppo ristretta per le due Associazioni fu, a traverso gli anni e gli eventi, variamente modificata e ampliata per renderla piu addata ai loro bisogni sempre crescenti alle esigenze sempre maggiori dei tempi nuovi. Inutile per noi esaminare ad uno ad uno tali rimaneggiamenti: essi non hanno in alcun modo adornato lo storico palazzo, ma anzi spesso, sostituendo lutile al bello, hanno sacrificato opere darte di qualche valore (1). La loggetta del Bigallo e il suo Autore. Conviene quindi meglio rivolgere il nostro sguardo a quel gioiello darchitettura cui e indissolubilmente legato il nome della Pia Istituzione: alla loggetta conosciuta come del Bigallo che e uno dei capolavori architettonici piu noti e piu ammirati di Firenze, e che conserva nelle salette superiori tutte le opere di pittura e di scultura, formanti il patrimonio artistico della Confraternita.",

Since, therefore, our beloved sons, the Preaching Friars of the Order in Florence, have at present undertaken, as we understand, to construct a church and other buildings for their own use, they take this opportunity  to ask  for your help in order to complete construction of said buildings. Fineschi, 141-142 Brown, 56 (n. 2). No. 1. 1251 The Dominicans of Santa Maria Novella supplicate pope Innocent IV for a renewed Bull of Indulgence for the construction project at their church. Borghigiani, CronMin I, p. 112. 1251.  Restando tuttavia sospesa la fabbrica incominiciata nella prima chiesa, per renderla pi capace, e non potendosi proseguire per mancanza di limosine, supplicano i Frati, e nuovamente attengono da Innocenzo IV altra simile Indulgenza alla sopradette da acquistarsi da chiunque cooperasse con limosine a termine [del]la fabbrica della loro chiesa. E probabile che detta fabbrica non si terminasse mai; ma che poi si gettasse gi tutto Vecchio e nuovo, quando poi f messo mano al gran Tempio, che in oggi si vede. 1251. Given that the construction in the first church to render it more capacious had, however, ceased, and unable to continue due to a lack of donations, the Brothers once again request and obtain a further Indulgence similar to the one mentioned earlier, to be acquired by anyone who cooperates with donations up to the conclusion of construction of their church. It is probable that said construction was never completed; but that they destroyed everything old and new when later they began construction of the great Temple that we see today. No. 2. 1272 The Dominicans of Santa Maria Novella purchase land in preparation for the construction of their new church. Borghigiani, CronMin I, p. 179. 1272  gi si preparavano per la fabbrica della nuova chiesa, imperocche non ad altro fine, che per acquistare spazio, e campo dove piantare ed alzare la magnifica mole, saranno state senzaltro fatte le compre, che si trovano in questo anno, como apposite.  1272. already they were preparing for the construction of the new church, because for no reason other than to acquire space and a place where they could lay out and build the magnificent structure, they must have made the purchases that are to be found in that year, as necessary.  177.

Brother Latino bishop of Ostia and Velletri by the grace of God legate of the apostolic Seat, greets brother Pasquale of Florence of the Brothers Preachers in the name of God. Bishop Latino orders that the Dominicans of Santa Maria Novella be paid the sum of 300 Turonese lire to meet the needs of the Florentine church and conventual buildings in construction. This sum shall be collected form what is recuperated from ill-gotten gains, usury and theft, provided that, after having given appropriate notice with an edict affixed in the designated places, it is impossible to find those to whom these recovered goods are to be returned.

And then the said legate on the day of Saint Luke Evangelist in the said year and month laid and blessed the first stone of the new church of Santa Maria Novella of the Brothers Preachers, of which he was a brother. No. 3. 1278 The Dominicans of Santa Maria Novella amass building materials for their new church. Borghigiani, CronMin I, pp. 190-192. 1278. Era uno stordimento mirare le montagne di pietrame, legname, mattoni, arena, calce, tegoli, embrici, docce, che torno lantica chiesuola si andavano alzando di giorno in giorno, con il continua trasporto dinnumerevole bestiame a somma, e col diroccamento de casolari ivi comprati, per far lo spazio a fondamentare lamplissimo Tempio. 1278. It was dazzling to see the mountains of stones, wood, bricks, sand, lime, tiles, roof tiles, and pipes, that gradually rose day by day around the little old church, with the continual transport of innumerable beasts of burden, and the razing of the houses bought there in order to make space for the foundations of the most ample temple. No. 4. 1279 Aldobrandino Cavalcantis dying speech. Borghigiani, CronMin I, pp. 193-194 (see Roberto Lunardi, Santa Maria Novella e la Croce di Giotto, in Giotto: la croce di Santa Maria Novella, ed. Marco Ciatti and Max Seidel, Florence, 2001, 166, for the transcription of this passage) 1279 per la mia morte verrete a conseguire ci che consegui Salamone per la morte del re Davidde suo padre. Con ci sia che egli entr in possesso dello immenso materiale da lui preparato per la fabbrica del tempio di Gerusalemme, con voi che sempre vi abbiamo amati, e riguardati come figliuoli rimanete eredi di quello da me copiosamente accumolato per la nuova fabbrica di vostra chiesa, quale non dubito che giusta il concepito disegno riescir cotanto magnifica e maestosa da esser certo di ornamento alla citt, di onore al convento, allordine, che forse in altra citt del mondo cattolico mai sar per avere la simile. 1279.  upon my death you will achieve that which Solomon achieved through the death of his father, King David. Just as he [Solomon] entered into possession of the immense amount of material that he [David] had prepared for construction of the Temple of Jerusalem, so you, whom we have always loved and considered as sons, will find yourselves heirs to that which has been copiously accumulated by me for the new construction of your church, which, I have no doubt, given the design conceived, will be so magnificent and majestic as surely to be an ornament to the city, and will bring honor to the convent and to the Order, such that other cities in the Catholic world may not see its equal. No. 5. 1279 Laying of the cornerstone by Cardinal Latino Orsini. Borghigiani, CronMin I, 199-200 1279. nella morte del Vesc. (ovo) Ald. (obrandi)no, loro tanto amorevole Benefattore, ripresero laffare della fabbrica, e pensarono di presto risolvere a gettarne la prima pietra affine anche di dare con la maggior prontezza fattibile lesecuzione a ci che gi determinato ave(v)a il def. prelato, e lasciato il tutto provvisto non solo per darne principio ma per tirarlo a buon punto. Alle loro pressanti istanze accetto il Card. Leg. F. Latino Orsini di farne la funzione, gli f fermata per lo giorno di 18 di Ottobre di detto anno. Venuto quel d, ed apparato decorosamente il luogo alla presenza di numerosissimo popolo concorsovi ed osservando i prescritti riti di S. Chiesa per tale funzione, il cardinale getto solennamente la priora pietra della nuova chiesa in quel sito, ove sta presentemente la Cappella del Crocefisso detta di S. Rosa, che in memoria del fatto fu dedicate a S. Luca Evangelista [es]sendo che fa di cui festa correva in quel d. 1279. At the death of Bishop Aldobrandino, their much beloved benefactor, they turned once more to the business of construction, and considered how to quickly organize the laying of the cornerstone, with the aim of getting as quickly as possible to the execution of that which the defunct prelate had already planned and provided for, not only to begin construction but also to ensure that it should be well underway. At their urgent insistence, Card. Leg. F. Latino Orsini accepted to perform this function, the date of which was fixed for October 18th of that year. The day having arrived, and the place having been appropriately decorated, and a great crowd of people having gathered there to observe the prescribed rites of the holy church for said function, the cardinal solemnly laid the first stone of the new church in that place where now is the Chapel of the Crucifix called the Chapel of Santa Rosa, that in memory of this event was dedicated to St. Luke Evangelist, since it was his feast day. No. 6. 1280 The Commune of Florence assigns an annual allocation of money and lime to the Dominicans for the construction of Santa Maria Novella. Borghigiani, CronMin I, p. 202 1280. La republica Fiorentina quel molto ambiva che la Citt, anche nel materiale delle Fabbriche vi  pi si nobilitasse, non manc di sovvenire la dispendiosa Impresa della nuova chiesa, cui avevano messo mano i Frati Predicatori con tanta soddisfazione, ed applausa di tutta Firenze. lmperocche con decreto publico, assegn a detta Fabbrica L. Fior. 1000 in danaro, e cento moggia ci calce ognnanno fino non restasse terminata detta Fabbrica  1280. The Florentine Republic, which greatly aspired that the city would become more noble, even in the material used for the constructions undertaken within it, did not omit a subsidy for the costly undertaking of the new church begun by the Brothers Preachers with so much satisfaction and applause throughout Florence. Therefore, in a public decree, the city assigned to said Fabric 1000 florins in cash, and one hundred moggia of lime each year until the construction should be complete. No. 7. 1280 The Dominicans of Santa Maria Novella obtain new relics. Borghigiani, CronMin I, p. 203 1280  pensavano unicamente alla struttura della Mura del loro Tempio si prendevano altresi a cuore di provvederlo in tempo di reliquie insigni, acci per mezzo della devozione a que[i] santi, si accendessero maggiormente i fedeli al Culto divino, da esibirsele con la loro frequenza alla sua nuova casa di Orazione, che si faticava per fondarsi. Uno di essi f Prate Gerardo del Pop. di SMN. Divotissimo di S. Orsola e Comp. VVMM quale per via di autorevoli corrispondenze in Colonia, tent di avere ed ottenere due sagre teste di esse vergini, una delle quali colloc tra laltre reliquie nella Sagrestia dellAntica chiesa di SMN e dellaltra, piacquegli di farne dono alla chiesa di S. Dominico di Prato, quanta poi ne fu de primi Priori dopo la fondazione di quel Convento. Ju 1280.  they [the Friars] thought only of the structure of the walls of their temple, but they also took to heart the need to provide it with important relics, so that through devotion to these saints, the faithful would be increasingly inspired towards holy worship, demonstrating it by their increased attendance in the new house of prayer they were working hard to found. One of these was Fra Gerardo of the Popolo of Santa Maria Novella. Most devoted to St. Ursula and the Company of Virgin Martyrs, of whom through authoritative connections in Cologne, he tried to have and to obtain two sacred heads of these virgins, one of which he placed among the other relics in the Sacristy of the old church of Santa Maria Novella, and the other, which it pleased him to donate to the church of San Domenico of Prato, since he had been one of its first Priors after the foundation of that convent. No. 8. 1281 The newly dug foundations of Santa Maria Novella cause a stir in Florence and its environs. Borghigiani, CronMin I, p. 210. 1281. Per tutte le terre circonvicine a Firenze correva la voce dei salutari progressi, che appr de fedeli andava facendo lOrdine de Pred. in Firenze, ed i comuni applausi che riscuoteva da quella citt, per la sontuosissima fabbrica della nuova chiesa, cui avevano data principio, che gi dimostrava da soli scavi defondamenti doveressere la pi magnifica sopra tutte le altre chiese che erano allora in Firenze, e muoveva glianimi ad idee pi grandi delle antiche nel fabbricar tempil al nome del supremo monarca dello universo, . . . 1281. Throughout the countryside around Florence, word spread of the healthy progress, approved by the faithful, which was being made by the Order of Preachers in Florence, and the general applause that it earned in that city, because of the very sumptuous construction of the new church that they had undertaken, which already demonstrated from the excavation for the foundations alone, that it would be the most magnificent of all the churches then in Florence, and it moved spirits towards ideas that were greater than the old ones in the creating of temples to the name of the supreme monarch of the universe No.9. 1286 Indulgences from the Bishop of Florence to those contributing to construction of Santa Maria Novella. Borghigiani, CronMin I, p. 219 (Lunardi, 2001, 168) 1286. Avvegna che brevefosse il suo Vescovado, Tanto in quei pochi d, che visse, non tralasci di esserne Riconoscente verso i Frati di SMN dando fuori una Circolare colla quella concedeva Indulgenze di 40. giorni a chiunque con limosine avesse contribuito allesorbitanti spese della Fabbrica della loro nuova chiesa. 1286. However brief his bishopric was, in the few days he lived he did not omit to express his thanks to the brothers of Santa Maria Novella, promulgating a circular in which indulgences of 40 days were granted to whomever should have contributed with their donations to the exorbitant expenses of the building of their new church. No. 10. 1287 The Commune plans a new piazza for Santa Maria Novella. Borghigiani, CronMin I, pp. 220-221. 1287. Avanzavasi a giornate ledifizio della nuova chiesa, e gi nellaltezza delle mura, e nellamplo circuito faceva la compassa di sua magnificenza, la onde (L: laonde) da tutti erano commentate la struttura [e] larchitettura, ed a voce comune diceasi che richiedeva una spaziosa platea che facesse teatro corrispondente alla superba mole. Su questo principi a trattarsi di ci nel consiglio del governo, e si deliber di eleggersi alcuni Periti, che si portassero sul luogo, e bene esaminassero, e disegnassero una nuova piazza davanti al principale prospetto della nuova chiesa di SMN che risguardava quella di S. Paolo, e referissero la loro perizia, il disegno, el piano di ci che occorresse, per darsi ad effetto. 1287. Construction of the new church made daily progress, and already in the height of its walls and in its ample proportions one could take the measure of its magnificence, so that everyone commented on the structure and the architecture, and with one voice said that it required a spacious piazza that would make a theatre equal to the superb structure. At which point they began to discuss this in the council of the government, and it was decided to elect several surveyors, who would go to the location, and examine it well, and design a new piazza in front of the main facade of the new church of Santa Maria Novella that faces that of San Paolo, and they would refer back with their survey, their design and the plan of that which is necessary so that it can be carried out. No.11. 1287 The Commune of Florence orders the evaluation of a certain property to be demolished for the creation of the new piazza of Santa Maria Novella. Borghigiani, MemMiscScart III, p. 50 1287. Gliuffiziali detti a far fare la su detta Piazza, fanno stimare la casa di Bartolo Conciatore, la quale confina con la via, che sandava dal cimiterio dei Frati alla Porta del Trebbio la qual casa si doveva disfare per fare detta Piazza. Guido Spadaccia Not. Reg. in Fir. 1287. The officials charged with overseeing the construction of said piazza make an estimate for the house of Bartolo Conciatore, that borders on the street leading from the cemetery of the Brothers to the Trebbio Gate, which house would have to be taken down in order to create the said piazza. Guido Spadaccia Not. Reg. in Fir. No.12. 1287 Various purchases of houses and land in preparation for the creation of the new piazza of Santa Maria Novella. Borghigiani, MemMiscScart lll, p. 70 1287. Sei carte di diverse compere di case e terre, comperate da diverse persone, delle quali non si riconosce se non M? Consiglio de Ceschi fig.l di F. Vivieri, che servirono per far la piazza nuova di detta S. Maria Novella, le quali erano posta fra la Porta del Trebbio e quella di S. Pagolo.  1287. Six documents of various acquisitions of houses and land, purchased from various persons, who are unknown except for M? Consiglio de Ceschi, son of F. Vivieri, which served for the creation of the new piazza of said Santa Maria Novella, which were located between the Trebbio Gate and that of S. Pagolo. No.13. 1288 The boundaries are established for the new Piazza of Santa Maria Novella. Borghigiani, MemMiscScart III, p. 49 1288. Essendo stato deliberato per la Signoria Fir. che le fosse, e il terreno delle fosse dalla porta del Trebbio fina alla porta di S. Paolo rimanesse per Piazza del Comune di Fir, e della chiesa nuova dei Frati Predicatori, e risguardando che dalle dette Porte non vie passaggio per andare alla detta chiesa, l anno 1287 per la medesima Sig.ria  deliberato, che dinanzi alla detta chiesa si faccia una Piazza che dalla parta dOccidente sestenda da muri della detta chiesa a retta linea fino alla Porta di S. Pagolo e dallaltra parte del terreno dei detti Frati, che  vicino alla via, per la quale si v alla Porta del Trebbio, a retta linea fino alla Porta del Trebbio. E perch fosse messo a effetto elegge sei Offiziali. 1288. Having been decided by the Florentine Signoria that the moats, and the land from the moats of the Porta del Trebbio up to the Porta San Paolo should remain part of the piazza of the Commune of Florence and of the new church of the Brothers Preachers, and given that from said gates there is no passage to go to said church, in the year 1288 by the same Signoria it was decided that in front of said church should be made a piazza that would extend on the west from the walls of said church in a straight line up to the Porta San Paolo and on the other side from the land of said Brothers, that is near to the street through which one goes to the Porta del Trebbio, in a straight line up to the Porta del Trebbio. And in order to carry this out six officials were elected. No. 14. 1295 How the Feast of Corpus Domini came to be celebrated in Santa Maria Novella. Borghigiani, CronMin I, pp. 233-235 [N.B.: There is not and has never been a p. 234. Borghiani apparently made an error in his page numbering.] 1295. Si era messo man alla immensa Fabbrica della Chiesa Cattedrale di S. Maria del Fiore, il Capitolo di essa pensava in qual chiesa della Citt tornasse meglio il fare la Festa del Corpo di Christo. F. Loth da Sommaja, quale nutriva tenerissima divozione al Santissimo Sagramento, che non ambiva che impiegarsi per la sua gloria, come sopra si accenn, non perse tempo; maneggiossi in bella maniera colla Signoria, e col Vescovo, e coi Canonici, tal che spunto che la Messa solenne de C. Domini si facesse nella chiesa vecchia intanto di S. Maria Novella: da essa partisse e ad essa tornasse a terminare la Processione come se la giustizia cos richiedesse, stante che S. Tommaso dAquino nera stato il Promotore di sua universale Istituzione, e lautore delle Laudi, e preci, che usa la chiesa cattolica in questi d. E credibile che molto conferisse a tale deliberazione il riflesso, che quantunque la chiesa vecchia fosse poco spaziosa, e capace di popolo, con tutto ci la parte della chiesa nuova che gi era in piedi, spezialmente la Crociata contigua alla detta chiesa vecchia, era di gran comodo alle religiosi, Collegiate, Compagnie, ed altri luoghi pil che vi dovessero intervenire ed a dar sosta a molto popolo ancora. 1295. Once they had begun work on the immense building project of the Cathedral of S. Maria del Fiore, the Cathedral Chapter was wondering in which of the citys churches it would be best to celebrate the Feast of the body of Christ. Fra Loth da Sommaia, who nurtured the most tender devotion to the Holy Sacrament, who aspired to none other than to work for its glory, as mentioned above, lost no time; he dealt in such a fine way with the Signoria, and with the Bishop, and with the Canons, that he made it so that in the meantime, the solemn Mass of Corpus Domini would take place in the old church of Santa Maria Novella; from here the procession would set out and to here it would return at the end, as if justice required it to be so, given that St. Thomas Aquinas had been the promotor of its universal institution, and the author of the Lauds, and prayers, that the Catholic Church uses today. It is possible that this decision was influenced by the consideration that, although the old church was quite small, and could not hold many people, together with all that part of the new church that was already standing, especially the crossing contiguous to said old church, it was very comfortable for the friars, the collegiates, confraternities, and other pious people that would need to participate and could provide a shelter for many more people. No. 15. 1301 State of progress on the new church of Santa Maria Novella in 1301. Borghigiani, CronMin I, p. 247 1301. Egl come certo, che la chiesa nuova di SMN dal Ponte in s gi si ufiziava, bench non ancora condotta al perfetto suo compimento, specialmente la Cappella Maggiore, imperocch met della chiesa vecchia era gia stata demolita, nel piantar le colonne, e far le volte della seconda navata, essa parte superiore della prefata chiesa si sar potuto chiudere la notte con le tre porte, che furono fatte nella fronte del Ponte, corrispondenti alle tre navate. 1301. It can be affirmed that the new church of Santa Maria Novella from the Ponte upwards, was already being used for divine offices even though it had not yet been completed to perfection, especially in the Cappella Maggiore, because half of the old church had already been demolished in order to erect the columns and prepare for the vaults of the second bay, so that this upper part of the new church could be closed off at night with three doors opened in the facade of the Ponte, corresponding to the three naves. No. 16. 1302 A portal is opened in the east aisle wall of the Lower Nave of Santa Maria Novella. Borghigiani, CronMin I, p. 250. 1302. Gi aperta era nella navata a levante la Porta al fianco, quale stava ov adesso lAltare del nome di Ges della fomiglia spenta da Sommaia, conforme si vede di fuori, nella parte del Cimitero, che rest chiuso nel recinto della Compagnia di S. Benedetto Bianco; onde al primo ingresso in chiesa per detta porta allato alla colonna a destra Pagnio Gherardi Bordoni a sue spese vi fece la Pila di marmo per lacqua santa, che pure al presente vi si conserva: fu principiata nel 1300, e terminata questo anno, come apparisce dalle seguenti due Iscrizioni 1302. A portal was opened into the eastern flank of the nave, which stood where today is the altar of the Name of Jesus, belonging to the now extinct Sommaia family, as can be seen from the outside, in that part of the Cemetery that is enclosed within the precinct of the Company of San Benedetto Bianco; just as one sees at the entrance to the church by said doorway next to the pier on the right a marble holy water font which Pagni Gherardi Bordoni had made there at his expense and which exists to this day: it was begun in 1300, and completed that year, as appears from the following two inscriptions No. 17. 1305 Description of the building site of Santa Maria Novella in 1305; civil discord in Florence leads to a slowdown in construction. Borghigiani, CronMin I, pp.264-265 1305. La nuova chiesa di SMN giusta alle mura maestre che ne formavano il continente e lambito, le colonne, le volte, le navate, la tettoia tuttora in piede, il prospetto, le tre porte principali di contra a S. Paolo, tutto era rozzamente imbastito, e cos alzata, coperta e chiusa la Fabbrica. Restava per, interiormente molto, e molto da fare; e vi corse deglanni parecchi prima che condotta fosse al total compimento; stante che il lavoro si proseguiva lentamente, essendo molto rallentate la limosine dei Benefattori per le rivoluzioni, saccheggi, rapine, uccisioni, incendil, e carestie, con che aveano ridotto Firenze all ultimo sterminio i Guelfi e Ghibellini, i Bianchi e Neri, ed i poveri religiosi stentavano fino nel necessario sostentamento imperocche per campare erano costretti a far laccatto ogni sabato per la citt, ed a prendere in prestito del danaro da Secolari benassetti per comprare grano, vino, ed altro bisognevole per lo Vitto. 1305. The new church of Santa Maria Novella right up to the main walls that defined its perimeter and the area [enclosed by it], the columns, the vaults, the naves, the roof still in place, the facade, the three main doors facing towards San Paolo, the whole building was roughly delineated, and as such, was raised, covered and closed. But inside, there still remained a great deal of work to do; and quite a number of years would pass before it could be brought to completion; given that work proceeded slowly, since donations from benefactors had dwindled considerably, due to the Guelphs, Ghibellines, the Whites and the Blacks all having reduced Florence to final destruction with revolutions, sacks, robberies, murders, fire and famine. And the poor religious were struggling even with basic necessities, so that in order to get by they were forced to go begging every Saturday throughout the city, and to borrow money from well-off laymen in order to buy grain, wine, and other necessities for food. No. 18. 1305 The altar of St. Maurice Martyr commissioned by Guido da Campi is erected. Borghigiani, CronMin I, pp.265-266. 1305  in tanto nella nuova chiesa pure questoanno vi si fece lerezione duno altare alla parete della seconda arcata a levante ove adesso sta lAltare della Nativita del Signore; il detto altare fu eretto in onore di S.

Questa cappella f distrutta e le pitture cancellate nella restaurazione di Cosimo . . . 1305. Meanwhile in the new church in that same year was erected an altar on the wall of the second bay on the east where now stands the Altar of the Nativity of the Lord; said altar was erected in honor of St. Maurice Martyr; over that entire stretch of the wall between the two lateral engaged columns the events of the life of the saint martyr were painted by the able Florentine painter [Bruno] at the expense of [Guido da Campi Constable of the Florentine Republic founder of said chapel]This chapel was destroyed and the paintings erased during the restauration of Cosimo .. No. 19. 1307-1308 The Minerbetti family makes a donation for construction of much of the eastern side-aisle of Santa Maria Novella. Borghigiani, CronMin I, pp. 268-269. (p. 268) 1307-1308. Molti erano i benefizi che il Convento avea ricevuto della nobile Famiglia de Minerbetti. I 1307-1308. Many were the benefits that the convent had received from the noble family of the Minerbetti.

The east aisle of the nave of the new church was in great part built at the expense of this family. No. 20. 1310 Surveyors determine the boundaries of the new piazza of Santa Maria Novella. Borghigiani, CronMin I, pp. 276-277. 1310. Il Comune di Firenze aveva rimesso ad alcuni periti a ci deputati il determinare, fino dove, fossero da stendersi i limiti della nuova Piazza di SMN, quale stava a buon punto di ultimarsi. Essi misuratori riferiscono doversi stendere fino in braccia 1119. Sul che si eman il pubblico Decreto dal governo, ordina che i confini della nuova piazza di SMN arrivino e se stendino fino alla porta di S. Paolo. 1310. The Commune of Florence had entrusted several surveyors to determine the boundaries of the new Piazza of Santa Maria Novella, which was nearing completion. These surveyors reported that it should extend 1119 braccia. Upon which a public decree was issued by the government, ordering that the confines of the new piazza of Santa Maria Novella should arrive at and extend to the Porta San Paolo. No. 21. 1310 Death of Fra Mazzetto in Prato. Borghigiani, CronMin I, p. 277 1310. Fior F. Mazzetto Converso di ottimo costume e Famoso Architetto: Mor in Prato mentre attuamente soprintendeva alla Fabbrica della chiesa di S. Domenico il d 11 di Ottobre. 1310. Fra Mazzetto, most devoted Florentine lay-brother and famous architect: He died in Prato while overseeing construction of the church of San Domenico, on the 11 of October. No. 22. 1319 The Commune makes a significant donation towards completion of the church, and purchases properties for the enlargement of the new piazza of Santa Maria Novella. Borghigiani, MemMiscScart III, p. 204 1319. La Republica oltre la limosina fatta per la fabbrica della chiesa di 10 mila fiorini, e per ognanno durante la detta fabbrica 100 moggia di calce: questanno compri a spese del pubblico molte case, da demolire per accreser la piazza, per maggior decoro, maest e della chiesa; siccome molto terreno, don dalla porta del Trivia e della Porta detta di S. Pancrazio, ed al quantofino alle fosse, che si stendevano lungo le antiche mura della citt. 1319. The Republic, in addition to the donations made towards the construction of the church of 10 thousand florins, and for every year during said construction 100 moggia of lime: in this year it bought with public money many houses, to demolish in order to enlarge the piazza and increase the decorum and majesty of the church; since it had already given much land from the Trivio Gate [= Porta del Trebbio] and from the Gate commonly known as San Pancrazio up to the moats that extended along the old city walls. No. 23. 1319-1320 Founding of the Spanish Chapel. Borghigiani, CronMin I, pp. 295-297 1319 - 1320 - Fondazione e principio della Fabbrica del Capitola dei Guidalotti, detto in oggi il Cappellone degli Spagnuoli, posta nel chiostro primo, o detto comunemente chiostro verde al convento. 1319 - 1320 - Foundation and start of construction of the Chapter House of the Guidalotti, today known as the Spanish Chapel, situated in the first cloister, commonly called the Chiostro Verde in the convent. No. 24. 1320 The Cappella Maggiore of Santa Maria Novella is completed, the high altar erected and an altarpiece commissioned for it. Borghigiani, MemMiscScart III, p. 95: 1320. Circa lAnno 1320 fabbricandosi la nuova chiesa fu fabbricata la Cappella Maggiore, ed eretto lAltare in Titolo del Assunzione di Maria. E tosto ne f assegnato il Padronato alla Famiglia de Sassetti; Indi a poco un tal Fra Barone Sassetti del Convento di SMN, come della Famiglia, face fare la Tavola per lAltare dal Pittore Ugolino Senese, e nel grado vi pose lArme della Casa; qual tavola vi stiede, finche il Ghirlandajo non fece laltra, che dal ponte se vede, a spese di Gio. Tornabuoni come app si dir Sassetti ind a del Tempo,  labbandonarono,  non se ne curarono, talch il Convento ritorn in possesso di detta Altare. 1320. Around the year 1320 while the new church was under construction, the Cappella Maggiore was completed and the [high] altar was erected with a dedication to the Assumption of the Virgin. And soon it was assigned to the patronage of the Sassetti family; soon thereafter a certain Fra Barone Sassetti of the convent of Santa Maria Novella, as a member of the family commissioned the panel for the altar from the painter Ugolino Senese, and on the base were placed the arms of the family; which panel remained there until Ghirlandaio made another, visible from the ponte, paid for by Gio. Tornabuoni; as will be said later the Sassetti from that time either abandoned it or failed to maintain it, so that the Convent came back into possession of said altar. No. 25. 1330 Progress is made on construction of the convent buildings, and donations flow in. Borghigiani, CronMin I, p. 319 1330. La Fabbrica ancora del nuovo Convento cominciava ad alzare il capo da terra; qua e la a poco a poco se ne mirava la bassa imbastitura e compariva il voto [i.e, vuoto] della platea, che doveva formare il gran claustro. Molti di quei religiosi ben affetti allo avanzamento comodo e decoro del convento, serano addati a renderla corrispondente alla magnificenza della nuova chiesa; Onde chi con limpiego di quatrini, chi con indicare qualche dedito Benefattore a spendervi, chi col frutto d(elle) sue fatiche, singegnavano di dar intanto alla  impostatura dun ampio Convento. 1330. The new convent began to rise from the ground; here and there, little by little the foundations of the walls could be admired, and the empty space that would form the great cloister. Many of those religious much attached to the comfortable and decorous advancement of the convent, took it on themselves to make it correspond to the magnificence of the new church; Thus, who through the use of monies, who by convincing a few dedicated benefactors to spend money on it, who with the fruit of his own labor, conspired to the accommodation of an enlarged Convent. No. 26. 1331 Fra Simone Salterelli donates money for the bell tower. Borghigiani, CronMin I, p. 324 1331. Fra (Tra) I benefizi pi splendidi fatti appr(ess) di questo convento dal Ven. Arch. di Pisa F. Simone Salterelli, certo supera di pregio tutti gli altri la fabbrica da fondam(ento) il grandioso Campanile. 1331. Among the most splendid benefices given to this convent by the venerable archbishop of Pisa Fra Simone Salterelli, certainly the construction from its foundations upwards of the magnificent bell tower exceeds all the others in value. No. 27. 1333 Construction of the Chapel of San Niccolo by Fra Jacopo Talenti and Fra Giovanni da Campi is at a well advanced stage. Borghigiani, CronMin I, p. 328 1333. Era a buon punto la fabbrica della Cappella di San Niccol. Sopra intendente fa Fr. Ottaviano de Rustici. Architetti e Capo muratori furono i due conversi Fr. Jacopo da Nipozzano e Fr. Giovanni da Campi. 1333. Construction of the Chapel of San Niccolo was well advanced. The Superintendent was Fra Ottaviano de Rustici. The architects and master masons were the two lay brothers Fr. Jacopo da Nipozzano and Fr. Giovanni da Campi. No. 28. 1333 The bell tower, paid for by Archbishop Salterelli, is completed. Borghigiani, CronMin I, p. 333 1333. La fabbrica del campanile dovettesi terminare in questo Anno, deducandosi dal millesimo, che leggavasi nelle Campane, fatte fondere pure a sue spese lArc(ivescovo). Salterelli. 1333. Construction of the bell tower must have been completed in this year, as can be deduced from the date which can be read on the bells, cast at his expense by the archbishop Salterelli. MemMiscScart III, p. 108 1331, 1333.. Campane. Il companile f fatto fare dellArcivescovo Salterelli, nel quale sono pi campane []fra le quali ve ne sono tre messe da lui.

Anno 1333. Florentinus me fecit. - 1331, 1333. Bells. The bell tower was built at the expense of the archbishop Salterelli in which there are several bells [] among which three were commissioned by him. On one of these is written this inscription: Ugolinus de Bononia me fecit anno 1331. On another are inscribed these words: Puccius Florentinus. On most of these are inscribed the words Anno 1333. Florentinus me fecit. No. 29. 1333 Campi and Talenti work on construction of the Upper Dormitory after the Flood of November 1333. Borghigiani, CronAnal I, pp. 344ff. 1333. Soprintendente alla fabbrica [del Dormitorio Superiore] fu costituito F. Taddeo Compagni, del quale abbiamo le partite di entrate e Uscita di detta fabbrica. Ingegnere e capo maestro dei Muratori era F. Giov. da Campi Sud; in qualit di semplici muratori vi lavoravano F. Lapo Bruschi e F. Franco da Carmignano, ed F. ]acopo Talenti fu laltro Architetto, e Capo Maestro, tutti conversi. Detto F. ]acopo Talenti e lo stesso, che altrimenti appellasi F. ]acopo da Nipozzano, quale per lo pi assieme con F. Gio. da Campi furano Architetti de prefati e di molti altri Edifizi in Convento, e per la Citt. La maggior parte de sassi, e pietrame per le muraglie, fu cavato da certa muraglia vecchia del primo cerchio della citt, che ottennero dalla Republica, e che doveva essere restata lungo la piazza nuova trovandosi molte spese fatte per disfare detta Muraglia, e per lo trasporto di gran soma a traini di quei sassi fatti condurre alla fabbrica, si servirono anche per le scale del Dormitorio di alcuni scalini di pietra levati dalla Cappella di S. Gregorio nella restaurazione, ed ornamento, che ne f la famiglia de Bardi in quell med. tempo. 1333. Superintendent of construction [for the Upper Dormitory] was Fra Taddeo Compagni, from whom we have the accounts received and the accounts paid for this project. The engineer and headmaster of the masons was the aforementioned Fra. Giovanni da Campi; working here as simple masons were Fra. Lapo Bruschi and Fr. Franco da Carmignano, and Fra. Jacopo Talenti was the other Architect and headmaster, all lay brothers. The said Fra Jacopo Talenti is the same who otherwise is called F. Jacopo da Nipozzano, who for the most part together with Fra Gio. da Campi served as architects of the above-mentioned projects, and of many other buildings in the convent and throughout the city. Most of the stones and rubble for the walls were recovered from the first circle of walls around the city that they obtained from the Commune and which must have lain for a long time along the edge of the new piazza given that it was very expensive to dismantle said wall and to transport by dragging the great load of those stones to the construction site. For the stairs of the dormitory they also reused several stones taken from the St. Gregory Chapel during its restoration and redecoration by the Bardi family at that time. No. 30. 1333 The new church is still under construction; work on the St Gregory Chapel in the transept is commissioned by the Bardi family. Borghigiani, CronMin I, p. 337 1333. Non per anche terminata la nuova chiesa interiormente. 1333. The new church was not yet completed inside. MemMiscScart III, p. 211 1333: Non per anche terminata la chiesa. Riccardo de Bardi di Vernio, viene a morte e lascia desser sepolto nella Cappella di S. Gregorio, al qual Santi lavevano dedicata i Frati, oggi di S. Domenico, per lo che i suoi figliuoli ottennero dal Convento la Cappella, quale ornarono specialmente di pitture esprimente i fatti di S. Gregorio e vi feciono la sepoltura della casata, detandola di ff. 200. Essi furono impiegati nella fabbrica del Dormitorio che dal Finestra (?) v al Noviziato e sobbligarono i Frati a lo disfare al m. anno. 1333. The church was not yet completed. Riccardo de Bardi di Vernio, when dying, requested to be buried in the Chapel of San Gregorio to which saint the brothers had dedicated this chapel, today dedicated to Domenico; for this purpose his children obtained from the Convent the chapel, decorating it especially with pictures representing the deeds of Saint Gregory, and establishing it as the familys funerary chapel, endowing it with 200 florins. These were used in the construction of the Dormitory that goes from the window (?) to the Novitiate and which obliged the brothers to take it apart (?) in that year. No. 31. 1334 Completion of the Piazza Nuova of Santa Maria Novella; the Commune issues rules for use of the piazza, and allots new annual funding for the church, to be used for maintenance of walls and roofs. Borghigiani, CronMin I, p. 342 1334. In questo anno rest terminata ed aggiustata la Piazza nuova; ed il governo, vedendo quanta conferiva la spaziosa teatro a rendervi  pi maestosa la compassa della gran chiesa in ornamento della citt, decret e pubblic il Supremo Magistrato che niuno. .. (M3204) fino a ordinarono inoltre  Ed ecco in che modo cominiciarono i secolari ad aver luogo nellOpera della chiesa di SMN fino dal cod. (?) Anno = Ordinassi inoltre (M3 204). [The numbers in parentheses are Borghigiannis references to another of his notebooks, MemMiscScart III, p. 204, where he transcribed the decree. See here below for the transcription]. 1334. In this year the Piazza Nuova was completed and finished; and the government, seeing how much the spacious theater acted to confer majesty on the compass of the great church as ornament for the city, the Supreme Magistrate decreed and published that no one  (M3 204) even ordering in addition And in this way the lay people began to have access to the Opera of the church of Santa Maria Novella from that year forward. In addition they ordered (M3 204). MemMiscScart III, pp. 204-205 1334. Decreto del Supremo Magistrato che niuno in alcuna delle Piazze di SMN getti  permetta starve immondezza veruna(?}: che niuno vi abbia casa, sia lecito farvi i sporti, se non che allaltezza di 5 braccia da terra; ne che vi possino abitare meretrici. Ordinar. in oltre, che ognanno che la terza parte di tutte le taglie de banditi(?), che venivano al fisco si pagasse per mantenimento della fabbrica della chiesa in perpetuo: quale annuo provento f ridotto poi a fiorini 200 fisse lanno. E da ci ebbe origine lopera di SMN, mentre per amministrare di detta Entrata si stabili che il Priore pro tempore del Convento con cinque cittadini fossero gli Operi; che morto alcuno daglaltri adunati in corpo si elegesse il successore, da confermarsi dalla Signoria. Detta Entrata si spendeva nel restaurare i tetti a muraglie della chiesa, secondo che occorreva il bisogno. Allora f che la republica decret la restituzione delle Decime pagate alle porte in somma di 230 - spesso mandava del pane al Convento e molto contribuiva per le sp.

I Padri voltero in segno di gratite. che nella sommit deglArchi della chiesa vi si ponesse lArme della Republica il giglio bianco in campo rosso. 1334. Decree of the Supreme Magistrate that no one in any of the piazzas of Santa Maria Novella should throw or permit there to be trash of any kind: that no one live there, sports are permitted to be played there, but only to the height of 5 braccia from the ground; nor may prostitutes live there. In addition they ordered that a third of all the bounties for bandits, that came to the revenue office should be paid for the perpetual maintenance of the church building: this annual income was later reduced to the fixed sum of 200 florins per year. And from this began the Opera of Santa Maria Novella, while for the administration of this income it was established that the Opera would be constituted by the Prior pro tempore of this convent together with five citizens; in the case of the death of one of them, the group would elect a successor to be confirmed by the Signoria. This income was to be spent in the restoration of the roofs and walls of the church according to need. So it was that the republic decreed the restitution of the tolls paid at the gates in the sum of 230 florins - often sent bread to the convent and much contributed to the expenses of the general and provincial chapters that were celebrated in Santa Maria Novella. In turn as a sign of gratitude the fathers offered to place at the top of the arches the arms of the Republic, the white lily on a red field. [Borghigiani, in the Cronica annalistica di Santa Maria Novella [ASMN I.A.28], p. 353 (for the year 1334) referencing Billiotti, notes that that some of the contents of this decree were later either changed, forgotten or simply went unfulfilled.] No. 32. 1334 The Commune grants monies for the construction of the church. Borghigiani, MemMiscScart III, p. 52. 1334.

Construction of the vaults and arcades of the second cloister, that is the Chiostro Grande. The south wing in front of the Infirmary was built at the expense of Fra Giov. Infangati, according to Biliotti, from his assets deriving from his work and with the help of his relatives, and of Archbishop Salterelli who contributed to the costs incurred by the vault and columns in front of his apartment, which he had already had built between the Infirmary and the chapel of San Niccol No. 37. 1348 Under Talentis direction a passageway is built from the Dormitory intended to lead into the Sacristy. Borghigiani, CronMin II, pp. 21-22 1348. Si fabbrica di nuova sotto la direzione o magisterio di F.

Once more under the direction or leadership of Fra Jacopo Talenti lay brother architect, a passageway or perhaps walkway is built to lead from the Dormitory to the Sacristy. This can probably be identified as the little raised walkway of the specchi [=mirrors(?)] leading from the Dormitory to the stanza dei Beati still extant today. This was done because at this time they began to keep in particular the library locked, from which earlier one could gain easy access to the Sacristy No. 38. 1349 Fra Jacopo Talenti builds the Carboni Chapel and the staircase leading from the Chiostro Verde up to the nave of the church. Borghigiani, CronMin II, pp. 23, 24 (p. 23) 1349. Gi era di poco eretta di nuovo col disegno, a capo intendenza di F. Jacopo da Nipozzano laltra Cappella di S.

There was already recently erected, again according to the design, and under the direction of Fra Jacopo da Nipozzano the other Chapel of S. Antonio also in the cloister of the Cemetery, on the side of the church, according to the wishes of Ulivieri Carboni, and executed by the Bishop of Fiesole, Fuligno Carboni his son (p. 24) 1349.

In the construction of said chapel it is believed that the Carboni family also paid for the stairs next to it that lead up to the church, near the Sacristy, and the door as well, for whomever enters the church itself, since above in the stone architrave is the family coat of arms, which display a rooster. 178 Doc. 9.

Si principi ad ornare lafacciata esteriore della chiesa, per altro legato di Turino di Baldese si mettono s tutti li stipiti, architrave, ed altri belli lavori di pietrame alle tre Porte principali e sopra vi si fanno fare le tre pitture che vi sono [Borghigiannis strikethrough] con incrostione di marmi bianchi e neri tutto il sodo inferiore,  prospetta della Facciata med., da pi fino al primo Cornicione immediatamente superiore alle tre porte inclusive; laltra met di sopra, stiede cos rozza a calcina per piu dun secolo poi. Tutta la spesa f fatta dagleredi Baldesi esecez. pone(?) alla mente di detto Turino, espressa come sopra nel suo Testam  def 1342. 0 1350. The ornamentation of the exterior facade of the church was begun. Thanks to another bequest by Turino di Baldese, the door jambs, architrave and other beautiful works in stone were erected at the three principal entrances and above they caused to be executed the three paintings that arc visible there with cladding of white and black marble on all the lower pan or prospect of said facade, from the bottom up to the first cornice immediately above all three doors; the upper half of the facade would thus remain unfinished and covered only with whitewash for more than a century afterwards. All of the expenses were covered by the Baldesi heirs as executors, according to the wishes of said Turino, as expressed above in his will of 1342. No. 40. 1351 A bequest by Fedaldino de Ricci is used for the stained-glass window in the facade. Borghigiani, CronMin II, pp. 28-30, 51 1351. Avendo Fedaldino de Ricci nel suo ultimo Testam. fatto un legato di fior. 400 - in sussidio della fabbrica della chiesa, che restava imperfetta, particolarmente nella facciata, gli esecutori Testamentari; erogorono nel fare il grande occhio di vetri figurati che sta sopra la porta maggiore di mezzo; e dallavanzo v chi dice che ne fosse intonacata tutta la detta facciata per la parte interiore, che tuttavia era rozza. Ma il Biliotti  con pi di chiarezza scrive: Fedaldino de Ricci don ed assegno in perpetuo ( in vita,  in morte)/ fior. 35 lanno, da pagarsi dallArte della Lana per sussidio e della fabbrica, e delle loro necessit:, e pagavono in una volta ffior 400, de quali F.

Fedaldino de Ricci, having made in his last will a bequest of 400 Florins - to be used for the construction of the church, still incomplete, especially the facade, the executors of his will disbursed the funds towards the creation of the large historiated glass oculus which is over the main central portal; and it is thought that the remaining funds were used for the whitewash of the entire upper part of the inner facade, as yet unfinished. But Biliotti with greater clarity writes: Fedaldino de Ricci gave and assigned in perpetuity (both in life and in death) 35 Florins per year to be paid by the Arte della Lana to subsidize the creation together with any related expenses: the heirs contracted with the convent and made a single payment of 400 gold florins of which F. Miniato Lapi with 300 Florins made the big historiated glass oculus of the facade, placing on the sides the arms of the Ricci, and with the other 100 Florins they brought to completion the said inner facade wall, as yet unfinished in some places.

Del restante la chiesa era di prima gi in/ uso per le messe piane per le prediche al popolo e per amministrarvi i sagram. alla Confess. e Comun. a Fedeli, mentre da qualche tempo aveva varie Cappella in essere per la Crociata, per altre parti della chiesa, e massime sopra e sotto al ponte.

[M.3 96, and Biliotti at 14] In early November of this year, the extremely deserving and erudite Fra Jacopo Passavanti was elected Prior of the Convent; he must not, however, have long been happy in this role, since his priorship lasted less than a year. It was during his priorship that the church is commonly thought to have been completed. But this is not exactly certain, in as much as at the time of his priorship the Cappella Maggiore and the railings(?) of the choir were modified; so that from then on they began to conduct there the divine offices of the brothers, both at night and during the day, reciting and chanting the [canonical hours and, in the Cappella Maggiore, chanting the conventual masses] together in the morning. The church, however, had already been in use for ordinary Mass, for the preaching to the public and for the administration of the sacraments of Confession and Communion to the faithful, while for some time there had been extant various chapels in the transept and elsewhere in the church and especially on top of and beneath the ponte. In the above-mentioned chapel of St. Catherine there was still much left to be completed, as there was also on the exterior of the facade, that still [from the middle up] remained only crudely finished as we noted above [the floor was still largely earth] and some chapels were lacking that would be added later. It is reported by the chroniclers of the [convent that] the entire construction process of this truly magnificent Temple that lasted [strikethrough] 77 years, including all expenses, cost one hundred thousand gold Florins; the families that contributed to said expense, beyond that largely subsidized by the Republic[with lime, and money] funded by the public, were: Ricci Tornaquinci Cavalcanti Minerbetti Rucellai Cerchi [M3. 234] List of families who contributed to the construction costs of the church and convent of Santa Maria Novella.

About this time one of the members of the Strozzi family commissioned the construction of the chapel of St. Thomas at one end of the transept, next to the bell tower. This can be deduced from the panel by the painter Andrea Orcagna at the foot of which is written Anno Domini 1357. Andrea Cione mefecit. Vasari asserts that he painted this panel in Pisa after he, together with his brother Bernardo, had painted the fresco on the walls of said chapel the Paradiso on one side and the Inferno on the other, according to the Dreams of the famous Dante, whose poem was greatly inspiring to said Andrea, since, in addition to the expertise in painting, sculpture and architecture that he possessed, he also delighted in poetry.

This year between the end of March and the early days of April the convent had the misfortune of its bell tower being struck by lightning, which caused great destruction of the said tower and caused so much damage to the roofs of the church and convent, and roundabout, given that the stones from the force of the lightning strike were scattered far and wide, that it necessary for the friars to come to an agreement with the City in order to help repair the damage to the bell tower and roof given the significant expense of some hundreds of florins.

Around this time was the period of the construction of the sacristy; it was erected in that half of the old church donated by Father Forese that was still standing throughout construction of the new church and which the early friars used as a sacristy. Mainardo of the noble Cavalcanti family who had served as Marshall to Queen Giovanna of Naples, for the merit that he had acquired through his valor in battle, wished to leave a memorial of himself in his native city; so with the advice, design and oversight of the often mentioned architect Fra Jacopo da Nipozzano, he [Mainardo] assumed the expense of turning the said part of the old church into a chapel, such as we see today; with this portion, that was then founded as a chapel dedicated to the Virgin Annunciate of the Angel, the altar was placed at the back opposite the door, with the panel showing the Annunciation to Maria, and at the foot of the altar was situated the family tomb.

In the month of April, and through the remainder of this year, the plague began a second bold assault, which Florence and its environs were forced to suffer more even into the following year of 1363; among the religious who experienced this poisonous death were  Another who died was the famous architect Fra Jacopo Talenti of Nipozzano; it also pleased God to call him at a good point, on the 2 of October, when he was still at the vigorous age of 60 years. Often mentioned in the foregoing, who for the excellence of his expertise in designing, directing and constructing buildings had no equal in Florence in his time. The Necrology and the Chronicle of Biliotti do him justice, treating him variously as a man whose work is priceless, both as a wise and prudent religious, observant in every way, and as an excellent professional, who practiced the business of his art with great humility, forthrightness and a lack of self-interest. To recall his most remarkable works: during the lifetime of Giovanni da Campi of whom he was disciple and student, and working under his supervision, he built the better part of the vaults of the new church, and of the Ponte alla Carraia. Even more so than Fra Giovanni, the name of the aforementioned [Talenti] acquired great fame, since he was acclaimed as architect of the construction of the bell tower, he continued construction of the church through to completion, and this supreme engineer and master builder erected the Chapter House of the Guidalotti, the vaults of the first cloister, not only those in front of the Chapter House, but also those of the other three sides, the better part of the vaults of the second cloister, the Chapel of the Cavalcanti, now the Sacristy, the large Infirmary, today the Refectory, the Chapel of the Cartoni under the vaults, and other construction projects in the convent and many throughout Florence, both public and private.

Erat autem ea ecclesia ad modum parva et ad occidentem sita, protendebatur illam plateam versus, quam no veterem appellamus. Utque coniecturari possumus, ex hiis vestigiis que prioris ecclesie remansereunt altare illius erat sub minori fenestra eius sacella quod sacristiam dicimus. Longitudo vero ad medium usque chori quod nunc cernimus erat, novum sacellum versus quod puritatis dicunt, a nobili nuper ricasolorum familia hedificatum. Ecclesai vero nova ad meridiem sita est: quasi ex transverso ad priorem ecclesaim, ut si crucem efficias, cuius structura et opus, longe magnificum, cetera alia nostre civitatis templorum hedificia superat et excellit, cum operis firmitate, tum et dignitate sua. Nam si ad primam eius ecclesie portam, consistas intusque illam spectes, cum testudinata sit, omnes illas testudines egregia arte confectas, uno simul oculi ictu perspicies, una alterius aspectum nulla ratione impediente. Constructa est autem, eo testudines genere quod, quintum acutum appellant. Quo dita firmissimum est ut etiam si pene columpnas incideres, in se ipsis manerent firmissime. Neque vero cathenis aut aliis huius modi apparentibus firmamentis consistit, sed in semetipsam illam artifices erigentes, egregium ac firmissimum reddidere templum, per omnia secula duraturum. Aiunt autem, hoc fecisse nostre domus converso. Quippe invenio et ita a mairoribus natu accepti, per ea tempora, ordinem supra septem et triginta fuisse ingressos, quorum plerique architectonice artis, peritissimi habebantur, quorum studio et opera templum pisum hedificatum est. Duos quoque pontes quod sante trinitatis et carrarie dicimus, ferunt hos civitati restituisse: repubblice sumptu, qui aquarium inundation corruerant. Solum autum huius ecclesie construende: a filiis jacobi equitis prestantissimi, tornaquinciorum clara familia procreati, altera exparte emptum a fratribus constat, reliquum vero a plerique aliis, cuius fortasse rei gratia, primum altare: tornaquinciorum familie attributum est. Fabbrice autem precipui cooperatores fuere, frater Paschalis primum. Diende Raynerius quem Grecum dixere. Postremo omnium prestantissimus. Jacobus Passavantes, cuius amplissimo studio ecclesia ipsa perfecta est, et fortasse ob meritum marmoreo sepulcro, ante maius altare conditus iacet. That church was indeed small in size, and situated to the west, it extended towards that piazza that we call old. And we can conjecture, from those vestiges that remain from the earlier church, that its altar was under the smaller window of that chapel we call the Sacristy. It seems that the length extended up to the middle of the choir that we see now, towards the new chapel they call della Pura, built recently by the noble family of the Ricasoli. The new church, in fact, is situated to the south; almost athwart the earlier church, so as to make a cross, whose structure and workmanship, extremely magnificent, surpasses and excels the other religious buildings of our city with both the strength of its work and its appearance. For if you were standing in the first door of the church, and you were looking at it, since it is vaulted, with once glance you would see all the vaults made with excellent art, and with another glance you would see clearly in another direction, with no obstacle. Indeed, the church was built with that manner of vaults they call quinto acuto. That is the most stable kind, so that even if you nearly cut down the columns they would still remain very strong by virtue of their own structure. And they stand without tie rods (180) or other such visible supports but by their very own selves: the builders made them outstanding, and most firm, so that it [the church] might endure through the ages. Indeed, this was done by conversi of our house. To be sure I have even heard and believed that in the time of the birth of our fathers, more than thirty-seven entered the order, of whom most were highly experienced in the art of architecture, through whose study and work this church was built. Also, they made two bridges that we call Santa Trinita and La Carraia, at the expense of the republic, to replace those bridges that had been carried away by a flood. The foundation of this church was built by the sons of the most distinguished knight Jacob, a descendant of the Tornaquinci family. There exists, in another part of the church, a relic purchased by the brothers, which, along with many other things, is located on the main altar, by the grace of the king. This is attributed to the Tornaquinci family. There were joint laborers in this building project: first, Brother Paschal, and then Raynerius called the Greek, and finally the most distinguished, Jacopo Passavanti, by whose most abundant zeal the church was completed. It is probably on that account that he merited the marble tomb that lies in front of the main altar. Fineschi, 9 Brown, 17 (note 2) Orlandi, II, 388-89.",

        "content"  : "Mark Rosen University of Texas at Dallas Don Stefano Buonsignori: A Brief Biography Until recently, little was known about the life of the cartographer behind the spectacular 1584 view of Florence. Unlike many of the great late-sixteenth century cartographers, he wrote no scientific treatises, did little to publicize his own work, and never forged lasting links to local artistic and printmaking communities. The entirety of his known output was produced under the patronage of Grand Duke Francesco I de Medici (ruled 15741587), best remembered as the patron of the Palazzo Vecchio Studiolo as well as his ill-fated second marriage to Bianca Cappello. A handful of scientific instrumentsa quadrant, four polyhedral sundials, and a four-bowl Scaphe dialin the Museo Galileo in Florence are Buonsignoris only known objects besides his maps. Buonsignori began work for Francesco as a replacement for the brilliant polymath Egnazio Danti, a favorite of Francescos father Cosimo I. In addition to publishing a dozen technical treatises and occupying a prestigious chair in mathematics at the University of Florence, Danti had steadily worked on a cycle of painted maps for a new space in the Palazzo Vecchio, the Guardaroba Medicea. Working slowly, Danti had completed 30 by 1575. For unclear reasons, Francesco fired Danti late that year and immediately installed Buonsignori to complete the spaces decoration with 23 additional maps, which he finished around 1586. Before being brought into grand-ducal employment, Buonsignori was not known as a cartographer. His entire career, in fact, had been in religious service and administration for the Olivetan order, to which he was initiated in 1541. The Olivetans were a Tuscan-based offshoot of the Benedictine order, with their large mother church, Monte Oliveto Maggiore, located in the Sienese foothills. The order had two major church compounds in Florence: San Miniato al Monte, the famed Romanesque church and cloister facing the city from a hilltop southeast of the city center; and San Bartolomeo a Monte Uliveto, an Oltrarno complex situated in the hills above the San Frediano neighborhood. The self-portrait of Buonsignori holding a triangulation tool at the bottom of the view of Florence positions him very close by San Bartolomeo, which in fact was where he lived from 1576 until his death in 1589. Although no baptismal record has been found, Buonsignori was constantly identified in the order, and signed his maps, as Florentinusa Florentine. Monks were usually initiated at the age of 18, meaning that he was probably in his early 60s when he made his birds-eye view of Florence. Because the Olivetans customarily asked monks to rotate from convent to convent (most of which were in Tuscany), Buonsignori had spent little of his adult life actually based in Florence before 1575. But when Grand Duke Francesco, pleased with Buonsignoris works on the Guardaroba maps, entrusted him with the plan to create the first large-scale view of Florence since the Francesco Rosselli-designed View with a Chain from a century earlier, Buonsignori seized upon the opportunity. Beyond his Guardaroba maps, Francesco commissioned from Buonsignori two new maps of his territories, the Dominio Fiorentino and the Dominio Senese, both of which were printed in 1584 and circulated widely (the Fiorentino would appear in a number of editions of Orteliuss atlas published after 1601). Those two maps, based on existing prototypes, were far less significant productions than the nine-sheet birds-eye view of Florence published the same year: Nova pulcherrimae civitatis Florentiae topographia accuratissime delineata. Buonsignoris comprehensive 125 x 138 cm view was engraved in copper by the goldsmith Bonaventura Billocardo and contained a dedication praising not only the beauty of the city but also the beautification of it by Grand Duke Francesco and his ancestors. The legend identifies 225 buildings and monuments, far surpassing the detail of any previous map of the city. Buonsignoris last major project was a small cycle of three frescoed wall maps for the Stanza delle Matematiche, a new room on the top floor of the recently completed Uffizi. Two of these frescoes, of the Tuscan and Sienese terriories, took as their foundation Buonsignoris recently printed maps of those regions. A third map of the island of Elba rounded out the sequence. The painter Ludovico Buti translated Buonsignoris designs to fresco in 158889, while Buonsignori applied the maps gold lettering himself. He died soon after and was buried in the church of San Michele e Gaetano in Florences Piazza Antinori.",

        "content"  : "Ferdinando Leopoldo del Migliore. Firenze: Citt Nobilissima Illustrata (Arnaldo Forni: Florence, 1684). Oratory of the Old Company of the Misericordia and the Captains of the Bigallo In order to understand the origins of this place, it is necessary that we speak  neither to be harmful nor prejudicial in favor of the Republic  of the levels of religious division that caused so much of the turmoil that infected and stained the Florentines. The Manichean (Patarini) heresy, which insisted that God was not the Creator of all visible things, provoked the zeal of Catholics who wished to defend true faith, and the two sides came to do battle with each other; the latter won the conflict at S. Felicita, where today there is still a sign of that victory on a column. [76] Saint Peter Martyr, known in those days as Fra Pier da Verona and who had initiated that battle, wanted to take advantage of the victory even though the Inspector General in Tuscany had exhorted the Florentines to set aside their animosity. Every time the city fell sway to that heresy, the Catholics were ready, with valor and with arms, to exert force to correct the errors of their ways; in this way a number of leading citizens who represented the twelve standards of the city (the neighborhoods) and the standard of the red cross on the white field (the entire commune) were able to call upon the people to organize in neighborhoods and strike against the full-throated recklessness of the followers of this dangerous cause. Therefore these twelve, because they sought arms to deploy and lead the people into battle, were in need of help. The saint (Peter Martyr) appointed a Crusader knight named Bzovio, regarded by the citys soldiers as their best fighter, as the Captain of the Counter Heretics. According to its Book of Entries 343, Volume 4, this group had originated in Florence under the direction of the celebrated Bu_satto with the help of the Inquisitors who fought heresy. It was supported in the time of Pope Innocent III, who came to power in 1198, and Pope Innocent IV gave it territories previously held by the Saracen King Saladin. Magri says that they wore a cross of velvet on their colorful hats that went from one side of the flap to the other, just like those worn by Greek clerics. But our knights, brave in battle against the infidel, went about in white clothes emblazoned with the red cross. Taking the sign of the cross, the captains who were appointed by Saint Peter Martyr and who had first led the confraternity of which we speak, first gave themselves the title of the Company of Saint Mary, and then changed it to the Misericordia, in order to perform pious works for which they later became famous. A great portion of Florentines, including both men and women, joined the group with particular devotion and stayed in the glorious city even after the death of their beloved founder, Saint Peter Martyr. Today we can find a book owned by the Bigallo in which are contained the first writings of the new institution, marked on the front page in large letters with words commonly seen in the time, In the name of our father, Jesus Christ, and the holiest pure saint, the Holy Mother Mary, Queen of Heaven and Woman of the World. In this book are written the names of the women of the quarter of San Giovanni and the area, who joined this Company of the Glorious Virgin Mary, patron of the city of Florence, [77] which was formed by the beatified martyr Saint Peter of the Order of Preachers in the year of our Lord Jesus Christs Incarnation 1260, on the feast of the Ascension of Christ. It is important to note that the participants took this book seriously, for a number of corrections were made in the original text; and like a reliquary, the manuscripts contents of important names of ancient families who were zealous defenders of the Catholic faith looks like scripture, and its authenticity shows the glory of Saint Peter Martyrs endeavor in Florence. To fail to credit its authors is to deny them the strength of their faith. This book also corroborates a story told by some about an old painting that was once next to the portal of the Residence of the Captains of Orsanmichele which depicted Saint Peter holding in his hand the banner that he carried into battle against the abovementioned heretics, and which is today preserved alongside other relics in the sacristy of S. Maria Novella and exhibited to the people each year on his feast day. Many hospitals were founded by the company, first by its soldiers and then by the confraternity of the Misericordia. The first of these was called S. Maria del Bigallo, located at a spot called Fontana Viva some five miles outside the city of Florence. This was the home of the nuns of Ripoli who, on 5 April 1267, signed a solemn contract with Ser Baldovino Ruffoli and the captains to accept his donation of funds to form the hospital that still goes by the name Bigallo. The nuns were received in this place, which is part of S. Domenico, and the edifice was built by a person famous named Buonaguida del Dado, known to have been part of the ancient Lamberti family. They went on to build other celebrated hospitals that some uneducated people dont fully appreciate. In 1503 the captains ceded the Bigallo completely to the nuns, where they are to this day and are celebrated annually by the laity who present them with gifts of wax. Because everyone is curious about the origins of the name, heres why its called the Bigallo and the significance of that name. Because one wants to speak twice of the rooster [gallo], the first letter B stands for Bi (two) or Bis (another): Bi-gallo, then, means Two Roosters. [78] Before passing over this, we must speak briefly of the other twelve hospitals under their care that were divided between two separate organizations: the first was called S. Maria del Bigallo (a.k.a. the company of S. Peter Martyr) and the other was called S. Maria della Misericordia, although both were governed by the same captains of the confraternity in Florence. This experiment lasted a long time, and with some success. But happily, in 1425  at a time when the citizens of Florence were preoccupied with threats from outside their walls and disastrous wars threatened the state  the city fathers deliberated in the Senate and passed a law that united the two companies and formed a new entity with the name of S. Maria del Bigallo. Eight captains governed the company and placed on the faade of their residence hall their coat of arms, which was a shield divided vertically with, in one section, a red cross on a black field with the letter F, on another the letter M in a gold band, and on the third part a white rooster on a blue background with the letters S.M.B. underneath. There were other pious works performed in the old institution, among them the receipt of orphans abandoned by their parents and relatives. In an act of supreme humanity, and with loud voices praising the diligence of the Florentines to look out for each other, there was a move made to expand the building by about half its size. In a series of entries in its statute books, particularly in the section Rub. 157 vol. III, we read the following words: Assigned to the company at Piazza Orsanmichele, vagrant boys and girls were to be cared for in the house of the Misericordia by official civic decree. Those who did not abide by this were punished with the fury of the law and branded with reputations that made them out to be as bad as thieves. Not content to let degenerate parents get off with this simple stigma, writers of the time made sure to cite transgressions in their books, where they wrote, haec tenet ambiguo Pueros errore vacantes, Nec pati pereat nescia turba laris, tuta sed hec fido maneant sub culmine donec reddantur Patribus pignora cara suis. Protected by the pledge of the trustworthy fathers who have promised to tend to them under this roof, children do not suffer the crowds or perish here, despite the errors of those who have left them with us, ignorant of the importance of the hearth, until that time when those children are returned to them. Fra Mariano, who was mentioned in the book of the Works of M.S. ___ in the library of the church of the Ognissanti in Florence, described its role as an orphanage as one of the charities that defined the devotion of Tuscans. This occurred during the time of the Principate, following the exercises undertaken by the magistrate of that time who was listening to the advice given to him by Pope Paul III Farnese. In 1541 Paul had to balance the wishes of his cardinals and Florentine citizens, and had a bull written to create a company that would count the number of abandoned children admitted into the Bigallo. He got Grand Duke Cosimo I to support it, and filled with good intentions, they were seen carrying [79] a sign of blessing to their subjects, sincerely applying his benedictions to those who were afflicted by the famine in that time, one of the worst in that period, which devastated the poor of Florence (but was not as bad as we endured during our battle of Tuscany). He ordered that the Orphanage of S. Caterina, in which were housed abandoned boys and girls (as we have seen), receive the patronage that was bestowed upon it by the pope on 8 July 1543 so that the children could live a decent and comfortable life. The year before, on 26 June (1542), the Grand Duke had declared that he, for the sake of the wellness of the orphans, would have the power to elect the captains of the Bigallo, which thus altered the general provisions that had been made for all the old hospitals in the past. These captains would receive the blessings of and privileges from the church, but they would be expected to conduct regular visits in return. The Archbishop Andrea Buondelmonte, on 17 October 1543, and the Cardinal Ridolfi, on 18 November, sanctioned this solemnly, as written and described by Ser Scipio Braccesi. Pope Sixtus V later celebrated this decision in a bull of 12 September 1587 which gave powers to those who founded a lay hospital like that of the Cavalieri di S. Stefano, that was neither for the sick nor for worship. After making this announcement, the first act of public possession and absolute control made by the magistrate was the decree of 1575, ordered by the chancellor and rectors of the commune who were waiting to visit the orphanages in order to obey the instructions theyd received from the government. As the pope had commanded that this position slowly transfer from ecclesiastical control to a secular authority the Grand Duke wanted to make it clear that thirteen gentlemen should form a body called by the ancient name of the Captains of the Bigallo and have officers called Head, Principle Director, and so on. A decree made by the supreme magistrate on 17 November 1542 reveals the selection of these captains by the archbishops, who hoped they would govern well because they had been appointed to their posts by members of the clergy and would observe the laws of God, difficult as it would have been for the captains to do so considering all the varying interests of people who were involved in the place and the judgments that had to be rendered over them. [80] He wanted, above all, to make sure that the authority to preside over all things civil  that is to say, criminal  would reside with the magistrates and not the clergy; this included the passing of inheritances to heirs, as one reads in the ninth book, rewritten on 119. The bull of Pope Paul III was executed by the government as a way to regulate priests and other clergy, depending on the hospital, and it imposed massive punishments on those ministers who disobeyed  like those refused to carry out the law of 75 that required them to visit orphanages in the countryside. In a document of 14 January 1585, those who lived there were allowed attend a public audience each Tuesday where priests performed the mass and read passages requested by the laity. They say that Agnolo Marzi Medici, the bishop of Assisi who was the first to be elected and who was the first secretary of state for Grand Duke Cosimo I, used to come with Roccetto  with no intention of disrespect for the citizens there  to administer justice required at that site of the sacred cult. Its good, then, that we see the following words above the door leading into the Audience hall (of the Bigallo), written in gold to commemorate the pope whose benefice left so much for them: The most peaceful Grand Duke, Cosimo the Magnificent, of Tuscany XII. Man of great piety, administrative skill, and love of country. Reinforcing this statement is the subtle figure painted in fresco at the door that represents the Allegory of Mercy adorned with a rich toga, a walking stick and a cloak that hangs from its shoulders. In roundels appear the seven works of the Misericordia; all of this appears in a state of devotion, as the governors of Florence stand with the people on bended knee to demonstrate that the piety of pilgrims triumphs over the power of the forum, armies, and even institutions, as the following words state: These are the mercies performed in this place, done according to the merit of this company and according to the ideas of these pilgrims, in the year 1342, on the day of September___. And above the big door where orphans are received, in the alcove that empties out onto the piazza, a similar fresco painting shows the way abandoned children used to be received, with some attention given to the different kinds of clothes worn by the pious. [81] There are also two other old stories, designed to show the concepts that have been described in this book, specifically the two principal acts performed in Florence by Saint Peter Martyr. The first shows the Saint giving the white banner, decorated with the red cross, to the twelve knights of this institution who, as we have said above, fought against the heresy of the Patarini. With great attention paid to their attire, with the red togas the likes of which are rarely seen elsewhere soppanante di Vaii co Maniconi larghi alla Ducale, worn they say by those ancient kings of the gold apron, they show the proper attitude in this singular picture. In the other painting appears the Devil in the form of a black horse charging toward the people in the Mercato Vecchio that confirms what is said about the saints life by his biographers. There we have the different stories about the old Oratory of the Misericordia, located where there was once the Tower of the Guardamorto and the public room of the exhibition of the cadavers, commemorated above and in other places. These earlier structures were used by the Republic during the time of Saint Peter Martyr to house the knights, and although this cannot be confirmed in any texts (despite the researches conducted in old writings of the Chancellor), Ser Amideo da Falgano wrote that he was a captain in the building when it was first used as an oratory sometime around 1240. We cannot be sure of this date because it is not written down, as was customary at the time. The sculptures that we see ornamenting the faade, including the two Madonnas and a bas-relief at the top of the walled up door, were celebrated by Vasari as the work of Andrea Pisano, who did a good job imitating the style of the ancients. The other figures that comprise a group of marble figures on the altar, all in the round with two angels at the sides, have been inserted into a rich wooden frame to form three tabernacles. This is the work of Antonio, called Il Carota, an excellent master who did other works like this in intaglio. We can see inside them, at the base of the altar, pictures of certain little stories painted by Ridolfo Ghirlandaio, the son of Domenico, a famous painter of the age. And now we turn to the temple of S. Giovanni, located like an island in the middle of the Piazza.",

Unfortunately this book can no longer be analyzed here; it includes the best and most exhaustive publication of all documents before 1149. Name Also SS Giovanni e Miniato (1) Building History The Baptistery is still one of the greatest enigmas in the history of architecture. From the high middle ages to today, the Baptistery has served as a favorite subject of historical fascination for serious scholars. It has been dated in the fourth and fifth centuries, in the seventh and eighth, in eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth or even fifteenth centuries, so that its building history fluctuates throughout an entire millennium. During Dantes time, the oldest dating was abandoned. Dante argued that the building was a creation of Roman antiquity, perhaps a temple of Mars (2). In my opinion, the still older dating in the third century of the early-Christian era needs to be abandoned (3). Lastly, the hypothesis of a Lombard-era origin is only contingently correct (4); Those other hypotheses of the foundation in the eleventh or twelfth centuries are also only conditionally plausible (5); the legends of significant (modifications) in the early Renaissance are completely wrong (6). I base my account on documents and the architectural remains, but these conclusions are speculative due to regrettably inconclusive excavations of the last half-century (7). The remains of three older cultural layers are located under the church. First, there are remains of a Roman palace that was probably established in the Augustan time and destroyed within Roman antiquity. Second, nested in the ruins of this palace, late-antique residential buildings and baths remain. At the end of the fourth century, this second layer was also destroyed. Graves of a Germanic cemetery dating to the early-middle ages occupy the most recent layer; one of these graves was partially destroyed with the installation of the left cornerstone of the apse of the Baptistery (8). Access to the digs: in the Apse. In 897, documents first mention a church of S. Giovanni located in the northeast corner of the Roman city wall, thus on high ground (9). It was again mentioned in in 909, 967, 990, and 1040 (10). Perhaps it was initially a Baptistery and Co-cathedral of St. Reparata; at the latest in the middle of the eleventh century, S. Giovanni ceased its original use as a cathedral and served as a baptismal church and as a home of the Cathedral canons. Maybe this shift was associated with the time when radical changes on the building were initiated. In 1059 or 1061 Pope Nicholas II, former bishop of Florence, likely performed a consecration in S. Giovanni, which was probably the cornerstone dedication for a monumental new building (12). The construction seems to have continued for a century. The first floor was largely finished by 1113, since Bishop Ranier, whose long governmental activity was closely linked with the first great progress of the new building (1077-1113), was buried in one of its walls (13). In 1117 the work was apparently still in progress, because the Pisans likely donated to the Florentines two columns, which then were erected in front of the Baptistery (14). In 1128 the ground floor was removed from the building (15). By 1150, and perhaps as early as 1128 (16), the design of the lantern concluded the construction of the dome and, therefore, the entire structure (17). Around this time, the cloth merchants guild began their control of the construction and the builders hut (18). Subsequently a few larger changes were undertaken on the finished church. In 1202 they replaced the half circle form of the Apse with an oblong choir chapel, the so-called Scarsella (19). Around 1207 the marble floor was initiated (20). In the second half of the 13th century the great dome gained its mosaic decoration (21). In the 1280s and 1290s, the Baptistery became the subject of a great architectural project for the last time, in connection with the redesign of the cathedral and cathedral square. In 1285 the city began to repave the square (22), and in 1293 or 1296, after removal of many funerary monuments, that had been embedded on the gray ashlar (Macigno), Arnolfo di Cambio encrusted external corner pillars of octagons with black-green and white marble coating. Through this massive renovation, he presumably wanted to match the Cathedrals new faade with that of the Baptistery; he also apparently replaced the upper section of the foundation of the Baptistery (23). Since then, S. Giovanni has only been restored, though very frequently and drastically. In 1339 Florence cleaned the dirty marble floor and refaced the chief ornamental molding of the cornices (24). In 1341-1346, 1364, and 1389/90 repairs on the marble roof took place (25). In 1444-1471 the tile roof needed to be completely replaced again (26). Leonardo da Vinci wanted to lift the whole building into the air in order to place a base underneath (27). In 1515 a chain was embedded into the brickwork on top of the second cornice for structural reasons (28). In 1548 broad, not accurately defined restorations took place (29). Despite the violent protests of the citizens, in 1577 Buontalenti removed the medieval baptismal font and the accompanying canons chancel out of the church interior in order to create a place for a baptismal scene in honor of Don Filippo, the first-born son of Grand Duke Francesco I (30); this was the most severe mutilation the building ever suffered. In 1722 the canons erected a new choir screen in order to integrate a sacristy into the apse (31). Around 1782 the architect Giuseppe Manetti cleaned the building and rebuilt the base cornice (31). From 1895-1902 the stonework of the lantern, the Tribuna, and the east side of the octagon were dismantled and reassembled (33). At that time, and again in 1912/15, the baroque additions in the apse and on the altars were removed. In 1887 the northwestern half of the Piazza S. Giovanni was dug up, in 1895/97 the southwestern half, and in 1912/15 the various building layers under the western half of the church were uncovered (34). A full clarification of the building history can only be attained through research of the remaining, temporarily untouched site under the Baptistery and the plaza. Reconstruction of Lost Construction Stages The Lombard Construction: 7th and 8th Centuries Likely a rubble-stone octagon in accordance with the current exterior old town walls (35). Several things are unknown about the Lombard Construction: whether an apse with or without a crypt was present, where the apse or apses (perhaps four) would have been located if in existence, whether a cupola or open timber framing covered the room, and where the entrances were located (36). Original Condition of the Current Building The Corner Pillars. As on all the most important frame joints on other buildings of the Florentine incrustation style, the pillars of Macingo (i.e. gray ashlar) on the outside corners of the octagon existed until 1293/96 (37) (S. Miniato, S. Salvatore nell Arcivescovado, Badia Fiesolana). The ashlar cornice under the apse serves as a reminder of this phase today. Figurative reconstruction of the original conditions, the change of base, and other slight changes can be seen in retouched photography by Swoboda, Kunstwissenschaftliche Forschungen, II, 1933, Table 5 (and p. 64f.). The Tombs and Monuments. Until 1296 a circle of monuments existed against the outer wall, which partially consisted of antique sarcophaguses and medieval tombs (Avella) as on S. Maria Novella (38). The Apse. The apse was supported by the semicircular foundations under the current, square choir chapel. Today only the inner approaches in both westerly corners of the polygon are from these foundation walls. For the remaining parts, see the illustrations by Supino (Gli Albori, 1906, Tav. IV) and Galli (Riv. dA. IX, 1916/18, page 82 and Fig. 13). The apse wall appears to have stood in loose association with the adjoining octagon wall inside and perhaps outside (39). A crypt was hardly in existence. It would have been tolerated poorly with the classical structure of the central room (40). The Apse was probably vaulted with a semi-dome and not incrusted (41). Baptismal Font and Choral Space. 1128 Removed in 1577, broken pieces rediscovered in 1905 (42). A uniform and magnificently marble-incrusted installation in the style of the correspondingly (probably copied but simpler) structure in the Pisan Baptistery (43). As the centerpiece, the baptismal font occupied the middle of the church interior, whose octagonal form is echoed in miniature. Its dimensions are indicated by the block-like foundation under the floor. It was adorned with rosette-filled coffers (presumably juxtaposed on each octagonal side as in Pisa). The rest of the ornamental panels are preserved in an Opera del Duomo warehouse, namely the larger coffer plates there. In four corners, small fountain-like chutes were attached, for the use of the baptizing Priest, like in Pisa (44). The actual baptismal font was enclosed by an octagonal gate, whose size is indicated through the undecorated surface in the middle of the Baptistery and also through the foundation walls, whose outline corresponds with it (45). Enclosed within the gates, the choral space was a rectangular, slightly-elevated area, that, in the width of the choir chapel, filled the space between this and the octagonal gates of the baptismal font, with the latter connected through a narrow passage (46). Remains of two sided colorfully-incrusted marble gates decorated with striking antiqued coffering were rediscovered in 1905 and were stored in a warehouse of the Opera del Duomo (47). In 1339 doors were attached on the canon chancel, and in 1341 as well as in 1458 grating was installed (48). The seating inside was renovated in 1466 by Andrea di Antonio di Geri (49). In 1577 Buontalenti planned a baroque chancel annex in the apse, to which the two spiral staircases ought to have led (50). In 1732 Girolamo Ticcaiati established a new, marble choir space in front of the apse. It is from a semicircular form around an elevated platform. Marble balustrade reliefs of the legend of John were installed on this platform (51). The structure was removed in 1912ff.  Floorplan from Abb. page 179 (left). The Stepped Foundation under the Church. It has never existed, as the excavations have proved. Similar to the theory of a Temple of Mars, its existence was bogus. The Circular Light-Opening in the Top of the Dome. Like the stepped foundation, this opening has never existed (53). Unsealed Outside Wall. Nonexistent. See the Building History and Building Description (54) Building Description Construction Records: The best by Milani, Annali dellIngegneria e d Architettura, 1918, 261-70 and by Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 118, 119, 129, 150. Also see Abb. on pg. 179, 186.  A list of older building records by Ferri, Indice, 1885, 38; The recordings are noteworthy from G.B. Nelli (18th Century) and from Giuliano da Sangallo (circa 1500) (55). The imprecise floor plans, cupola projection, usw. by Hbsch (Altchristliche Kirchen, 1862, Pl. XIX, 4), by Durm (Zeitschrift fr Bauwesen, 1887, Taf. II), by Nardini (S. Giovanni, 1902, Fig. 17) and by Supino (Gli Albori, 1906, S. 45); compare to that the critique by Horn (Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 122, Note 8). Before the oldest building records, several painted depictions of the Baptistery emerged already in the 14th and 15th centuries. (56). The Basic Concept As the Florentine counterpart to the Pisan Cathedral and to the Church of St. Mark in Venice, the Baptistery is one of the greatest primary works of medieval architecture. It is essentially a standard creation of the late 11th and early 12th centuries. Its basic motivean octagon with a choir chapelhas likely been copied from the predecessor of the current construction, the Lombard Baptistery. It would appear to be a late echo of the origins of the early Christian baptismal churches (57). The style, in which this motif was implemented, represents this fantastically and surprisingly successful attempt to build around the impoverished art world of the early Middle Ages a new world, that should allow the inherited talent of the Italian race to finally advance after long centuries of abstention. The ingenious architect, who laid the foundation of the Florentine and therefore of the new Italian and European architecture in general here, began as his contemporaries in Pisa and Venice with an appropriation of the achievements of the diverse architectural schools of the early Middle Ages in the Mediterranean region, and of the Byzantine, and created on this foundation an entirely novel design of the character of the High Middle Ages. Thereby he subdued the newly-won exuberance much more decisively than the other architects of the great coastal cities and refined the pomp to symmetry in the way of the roman, western Classic, from which this late antique eastern offshoot had first arisen (58). This development was appropriately named proto-Renaissance. Material  Unity of Construction The structural central wall is composed of ashlar (Macigno), the decorative casing primarily from white Carrara marble and black-green Prato marble. The ashlar core is laid in interlocking layers, according to the changing layering techniques from the middle of the 11th century to 1150 (60). The ashlar core and marble incrustation are interwoven into each other. The central walls arose simultaneously after a unified planning (61). The ashlar can be seen today in the cornices underneath the attic. Originally the corner pillars of the octagon were also executed in ashlar (62). Repurposed columns and capitals that originated from antique buildings were incorporated into the construction (63). Details may be found in the descriptions of individual components. The Construction as a Whole Octagonal central building with an eight-sided, tented, not-very-steep pyramid roof, on whose top an eight-sided lantern rises upward; on the west side there is a horizontal, rectangular choir chapel. Through this chapel, the octagon obtains a line to the west; its central axis lies in the extension of the east-west central axis, formerly situated east from the Baptistery towards Sta Reparata Cathedral. The four that are parallel and right angled to the central axis were treated as main sides, and the four that are diagonally directed are less emphasized. The main sides are distinguished by these three features: they are stretched a little longer, they include the apse and the three portals, and their facades are differentiated from the others through semi-columns, richer tabernacle grouping, and through a richer incrustation motif. Also, the windows of the upper floors, whose somewhat eccentric position in the barrel niches of the gallery initially stand out as a large irregularity, are only shifted to the outside in the two side vaults of each wall in order to be able to fall in the middle of the section on the (longer) exterior of the wall, so in turn they are planned with special sensitivity for organic effect. On the inside, the middle of each of the eight sides differentiates itself from the flanking sides: it is broader and has columns from expensive materials in the biforium of the gallery (64). The main doors (in the East) emerge ahead of the two side doors through the expensive material of the columns that border the main doors. About the very important role that the destroyed baptismal font had played in the structure of the building, see Under Reconstruction. The structural framework and decoration, and the interior structure and exterior structure are so deeply related to each other that it is as if they reciprocally reflect one another. Here we see a composition and form completed by a genius architect that appears as High Medieval, but at the same time totally Florentine: his interest in the antique signals his status as an early Renaissance, or Proto-renaissance, builder (65). Exterior On the walls (with the exception of the choir side) three floors contrast with each other: the bottom floor with doors, the middle with windows, and the upper in the shape of an attic. The two bottom floors exhibit reliefs and are connected through corner pillars; The attic does not extend as far outward and exhibits a more restrained relief (66). Good illustrations may be seen in Swoboda, 1933, and Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz, V, 1938, 99. The Corner Pillars. by Arnolfo di Cambio (?), around 1293/96 On each corner of the octagon, around which these are spaced, a pillar protrudes from the walls; modeled after the Pisan style, they are colorfully structured with layers of white and black-green marble. The woodworking of the bottom floor traverses the corner pillars and merges them with the walls. The Base Profile. from Arnolfo di Cambio (?), around 1293/96 and faithfully restored in 1782. The only things preserved from the original were the cylindrical buffers in front of the corners of the octagon (67). Initially, the cobblestones of the piazza were a little bit deeper so that the base profile came more clearly into effect. The Bottommost Floor. from around 1059-1128 Antique Framework: the corner pillars and the pilasters and wall-columns between them support an entablature that cranks itself across all wall supports with camphor; on the four slanting sides of the octagon, every second pilaster is from green marble. On the three straight, longer sides in the south, east, and north, every two wall-columns  together with a connected woodwork piece  forms a doorframe that monumentally emphasizes the three entrances. [Each of these constructions forms a frame around the doorway through which these entrances are monumentally emphasized] (68). All the walls are covered with white marble. Decorative stripes of green marble (verde di Prato) are inlaid in the white surfaces. On the slated sides these form simple rectangles and, indeed, in each intercolumniation there are two taller ones below and three squatter rectangles above. On the three sides with doors, three are richer themes: near each door on both sides there is a giant powerful rectangle, above which appear two transverse rectangles with a central star filling the rectangle, whose dark stripes break up the white squares on their sides. On the corner pillars of the Eastern, most important, Portal stand two antique columns that were stolen in 1117 from the Arabs in Maiorca (69). All the capitals come from that era (70). The Middle Floor. from 1100 to 1128 It nearly corresponds to the bottom floor, but it is somewhat taller than the bottom floor and has more variation. Over each Pilaster and over each half column, a green marble pilaster rises from each abutment as a halved octagon-column with abutments in each case (71); over each of the two half-columns there is a semicircular, delicately-profiled, blind arch from green marble; on the corners of the octagon, these arches rest on the corner pillars described above. The middle arch on each of the three straight portal sides of the south, east, and north is broader and higher than the other arches. The larger width corresponds to the portal width beneath it. Above the arches is a high, but delicately profiled, ancient decorative frame support from gray ashlar (Macigno). In each wall surface appears a window with delicate framing of green marble: on the four slanted sides, the shorter sides of the octagon, there is a round-arched window between the two gabled tabernacle windows; on the three straight main sides of the south, east, and north a tabernacle window sits between two rounded windows. It is the oldest example of antique tabernacle windows and, similarly, of a rhythmic organization of such windows that existed in Tuscany since the beginning of the antique era. It is the greatest example of a High Renaissance motif of this type. On the cornered tabernacles there are pilasters that act as supports for the gables, and on the colonettes there is spiraled flutinga late antique motif (72). The white marble walls again have a green decorative stripe: under the windows appears an order of the arches of vertical strips and above there are floating rounded arches; under and near the windows there are horizontal stripes; above, in the arches, two sequences of rectangles that disappear above and laterally underneath the arches (73). Above the arches, between these and the encircling entablature, triangular gusset tabs are to be found that replicate the arched, horizontal, and vertical lines of the framing relief partition. These beautiful capitals all date from the construction period (74). The Attic. around 1128 An antique motif and in particular an antique execution. Flatter, lighter, and more delicate than the underneath, somewhat older floors. Particular to this floor, each polygon side of the attic is separated into three fields, and namely through fluted pilaster with especially antique, especially delicate, succulent capitals (75). In each area there is a green banded rectangle, and inside each there are three slim, tall banded rectangles; all bands are from green marble. The wall area and the pilasters are from white marble. On the pilasters rests an antique entablature, that bends downward in a very medieval way onto the eight attic corners and runs along perpendicularly on these corners as far as the base of the attic (76). Above the entablature, there is a wider frieze with magnificently rich, colorfully executed incrustation decoration (77). The Roof. around 1128/1150 Eight-sided, tent-like, flattish, ascending pyramid from white marble (78). At the foot of the approach there is a narrower, delicately incrusted, ornamental band made from a series of gothic pointed quatrefoils; 1339 (79). The Lantern. 1150 (80) A Byzantine motif, implemented here in a structural building, virtually Classical-Antique in decoration, contrasts with the more lavish splendor of the late Romanesque. An octagonal small temple is formed by white marble: eight smooth columns with Composite capitals, with glazing between them; above, an entablature and a robust protruding fillet of marble, both sculpted and encrusted all over in the style of the contemporary Pisan ornamentation (81); Above, a seemingly steep, eight-sided, pyramidal roof from marble is crowned by a bronze cone and a cross. The Choir Chapel. 1202 ff. Named La Scarsella (the pilgrim pouch) because of its form. Horizontal rectangular annex on the west side of the octagon. White marble with decorative elements from green and colored marble. The structure connects to the system of the middle floor of the octagon: on each side wall there is a blind arch, on the rear wall there are two blind arches. Rich incrustation ornamentation of late Pisan character. Above on the corners, there are lion heads and masksmotifs that likewise ultimately originate from the formal style of the Pisan Late-Romantic (82). The four corner pillars and perhaps also the pediment are probably a part of the additions with which Arnolfo di Cambio enriched the Baptistery around 1293/96. Interior This is the actual core of the whole structure. The riches of the room develop from here moving outward. From the structure of the interior, the outer structure is determined (83). The octagonal central room, topped with an eight-sided, peaked, abbey-vaulted cupola. In the west there is a crossed, rectangular choir chapel.  The sketches on page 186 serve as a base illustration of the exact description.  Swoboda took a photo in 1933. See Horn, who was at the Institut in Florence, 1938, 123. The Structural System. Underlying that structural system is the tenant of active resistance. The weight of the cupola is not balanced out (like classical Roman structures) through the thickening of these curtain walls, but rather concentrates in its foundations on specific points and passes all the way into the ring of the foundation. We are dealing with a transversal framework. The walls girdles that are exhibited inside and out are not built into the transversal framework but appear to be mounted and superimposed (84). The principle of active resistance was part of the late-antique Byzantine school and contrasted with the Classical Roman system. The chief architect of the Florentine Baptistery had this idea from Byzantium (probably inspired by S. Vitale in Ravenna!), and he continued to boldly develop the principle so that he was always considered one of the greatest innovators in the area of architectural construction. See the construction schematic on page 186. It shows only the emerging framework, not the walls that span it. The Wall Structure. The foundational framework of the church makes up around the corners of the octagons eight broken powerful pillars. These are the only part of the construction that carry through the whole thickness of the peripheral walls and their full strength is from the base of the cupola area (85). These corner pillars are supported through these in-between walls and spacing, that in the individual floors take on various forms. There, the vertical walls of the polygon support two floors, and both floors each have two layers, an inner and an outer. The outer is comprised from an inner with marble incrusted walls, the outer wall of the octagonal building; It is very thick in the bottom floor, but thinner in the upper floor. The inner layer dissolves into an antique pillar system. Behind two pilasters appear wall pillars, upon which stands each corner of the octagon. An antique entablature and a mosaic frieze lies above and between each of the eight sides between each set of two pillars. Above it arises a light and richly organized upper floor. Each corner pillar, each with two smaller pilasters, has two equal pilasters between them on each polygonal side. Between them on each of the seven sides of the octagon there are three divided openings with semicircular arches (Biforien) which are engaged with the upper floor (freely following S. Vitale in Ravenna); in every opening of the divided, mosaiced balustrade appears a slender dividing center column. Buttresses stretch between the front pillar system and the back wallI think thats how they are arrayed radially around the middle point. In the bottom floor behind each intercolumniation there is a segmented arch; in the upper floor behind each biforium there is a large, barrel vaulted niche, on which black and white fresco painting fakes marble incrustation. Above the gallery, there is an antique structure with a mobile frieze. The Cupola. An eight-parted, gothic-arched, monastery dome. The construction is developed out of these underlying zones. The following buttress system is hiding between the eight triangular, spherically curved, cupola peaks and the eight-sided pyramidal roof (86). In the middle of each of the sixteen walls of the gallery arise sixteen support posts (sproni), that are arranged to look like abutments against the cupola cap. Between every two support posts there is an attached, upward-rising, narrow barrel vault. Every two other support posts are allotted to the eight corners of the buildingthey are so positioned that their outsides are aligned with the edges of the corresponding columns that are underneath the support posts, which creates, so to speak, a forking of the columns (87). Decoration: on the base of the cupola there is a frieze from a rectangular ornamented field, including medieval reproductions of antique coffering techniques. Each ornamented field has a white, entablature-like, prominent marble frame and a green-black framing laid around it, and contains a figured mosaic. Five squares are allotted on each cupola field; Around each corner there is another square. Above the square friezes there runs a final white-green-white marble striping. Over that is the great cupola mosaic in which the architectural outlines of the walls appear and disappear in the form of painted-on fake columns (88). The Developmental History of the Structure. The octagonal floor plan was taken from the older, Lombard Baptisteries of the sixth centuryparticularly from S. Vitale in Ravenna and adds a lantern to the cupola, a gallery (with its biforien) and buttresses in the form of split walls (89). Besides the Byzantine late antique, the architect of the Baptistery was inspired by the classical Roman antique of the early empire through the Pantheon in Rome. The following motifs are inspired by the Pantheon: the structural thinking behind the peripheral wall that is placed against the transversal barrel vault in loadbearing and nonloadbearing zones (90); The expressly horizontal partition of the inner wall by two powerful circumference-running entablature systems and floors; the way the triumphal arches of the choir chapel effectively break up the entablature of the ground floor; the arrangement of pilasters of the upper floor about the arches; the areas, each covered with two columns in the ground floor; and the coffers at the base of the cupola (91). From these Byzantine and Roman principles and motifs that the architect used, he developed something completely new. His invention is probably the octagonal, lancet arched, domical vaults of the cupola (92), and surely his buttressing system is the other invention, with which the functional is merged with the wonderfully beautiful. Essential characteristics of the partitioning system comply with the common European demands of High Medieval Romanesque architecture. Above all, the thing that comes across as Romanesque is the completely un-antique, un-byzantine principle of the structure of frame, inner and outer, that allows the walls to mirror one and the other. The structure of the framework is traceable on the partitioning of the wall space and in this way artistically capitalizes on it (93). The abstract orderliness that comes out of the rigor of the spirit of mathematics appears very un-antique and fully Romanesque. There is not one decorative singular form that is free of this mathematical orderliness; every part of the construction is related to something underneath it or superimposed over it (94). The last thing that really comes across as Romanesque is that the room, along with its masonry shell, is segmented into a series of sectors that radiate from a central axis of the octagon (95); the central structure doesnt have the same effect, like the Classical and Byzantine Antique as an image of concentric, circumferential walls and room sequences, but rather as if it is split into a series of radiating yokes. In other words, the central structure is treated in the spirit of the High Romanesque Lombard nave buildings (96). One thing of course differentiates Florentine building from the High Romanesque construction of Northern Europe and also from its Carolingian-Ottonian predecessors, and it is something very serious: there is an antiqued Classicism of incomparable purity, and this Classicism calls a first Renaissance into lifethe first attempt of a Florentine architect to revive the values of the national Antique, or the ancient Roman architecture, a search that determined the course of Florentine art up until the High Renaissance. Antique is the simple, peaceful unity of space: in my opinion it is thanks to the great example of the Pantheon that the Byzantine ambulatories and galleries come together here in a relief-like, relaxed wall area (97), that the single-celled octagonal central room, as a result, so majestically comes into its own. The tempietto-form of the cupola lantern is Antique, not Byzantine and not Romanesque! Also, without a doubt, another Antique feature is the fact that there are no sculpted figures to ornament the faadea completely unRomanesque quality! And finally, its Antique appearance is certainly not the function of the individual elements of the building (an essential Romanesque quality), but a correlation of form and proportion in a consideration of the whole. The Intercolumniation and Other Individual Things. Regarding the external portion of the building see page 182 and following. In the inside, the pilasters in both floors are fluted, the columns themselves are smooth (with the exception of a single one that stands to the right of the east portal). All ancient capitals each consist of a single block of white marble and are gilded; the pilasters have Corinthian-style capitals. On the large columns in the bottom floor they are of the Corinthian and Composite style, while on the little columns of the gallery-biforium the capitals were sculpted in the Ionic style and carry flat Byzantine imposts. The following parts are antique spoils (from the early classical Roman empire?): the fourteen large columns of the ground floor (twelve out of granite from Elba; one, left of the south door, out of Cipollino; and one, the fluted one to the right of this door, out of white marble) (98); the four capitals of the large columns behind the south and north doors; possibly also one or another of the four footings of those columns (99); all the columns in the gallery in the middle of the biforium of every octagonal side are vertical colonnettes (out of Cipollino and white marble; the remainingnot ancientout of green marble and one out of ashlar) and the three ionic capitals of northwest diagonal, octagonal side immediately to the right of the choir chapel (100). All remaining parts of the columniationby far the mostcome from the High-Medieval building era. The column capitals are a part of one solid block (like the ancients), others are made out of two or more stacked blocks (as was common in Florentine architecture during that period) (101); the large ones in the bottom floor were developed and rounded and, with the exception of two, the small ones on the gallery-biforien are completely front-facing (102). The pilaster capitals, without exception all from the middle ages, are from white marble and each have a frontispiece and two lateral side pieces (103). All high medieval capitals were modeled after the antique and, indeed, are so astoundingly true to that form that you can hardly differentiate them; at best it can said, in the imitation process a little bit of the organic-leafy character of the model pieces can be lost, and therefore it gains a quite hint of medieval systematizing abstraction (104). The consecutive constructive phases were probably brought about by various stone masons and their variations in the way they executed the building. On the ground floor, there are primitive examples with closed contours side by side, with very wide and flat acanthus leaves and with crude singular forms, and also finer examples  the latter are above all on the pilaster on both sides of the choir chapel (105); The later also correspond to the capitals on the first floor of the external part of the building (106). There is a third type that can be found outside on the middle floor of the southeast corner of the octagon (107). From that third type evolved a wonderful, noble type of pilaster capital on the (middle) gallery floor (108). The following can be said about the classicism of the pillar system: Not that they would have been satisfied according to early Christian-Early Medieval custom or according to their own inability to help naively through the plundering of Roman buildings. No, for the first time here in Florence a genius architect dared to try to conjure up a unified antique column system from a very few remains of the golden era, from a few column shafts, capitals, and profiles. On the baptistery the following antique elements of new architecture were added: the Corinthian, Composite, and Ionic system (columns and pilasters); the straight entablature, and the entablature-like arch profile; the imposts; the tabernacle windows; the coffers; the cymatium of various styles and more, indeed in great purity, shines forth out of high medieval European design and also out of contemporary Tuscan design. More important than the inclusion of the classical design was the reinvigoration of the way it is used and the reinvigoration of classical proportions. Very decisively it determines the impression of the building, that columns and pilasters have taken on their original height and strength; that a new strict law of proportionality between the supports and intercolumniation is in place; that the well-proportioned surfaces have again assumed their original level of importance (109). In consideration of all that, the building had to have two main floors designed to adhere to new laws of proportionality; almost every other contemporary builder in the same position would have decorated the walls with a singular overly-slender column system from the ground to the cornice (Medieval Roman!) (110). The approach of the Antique was so convincing that even a century later, the construction was considered a remnant from Roman times, and thus, in the Quattrocento, it came to form the starting point of the Renaissance movement (111). The Incrustation. The Incrustation motif on the walls of the inner rooms are similar to those on the outside, but richer. On the ground floor, the two stories of the rectangular frame reappear on the diagonal sides of the octagon again, and the two floors highlight the faade; but between them a lively connection links their edges, with a row of squares that are turned on their corners, decorated with rosettes, crosses, and other geometric motifs. On the straight, main sides are arches and gables above squares. Between the biforien and the upper gallery geometric forms, understated leafy forms, vases, and lighting unfold in this narrow surrounding strip broken up by the pilasters. In the style of this strip, but freer and lighter, the 13th century mosaic work of the inner gallery is painted (112). The Developmental Historical Meaning of the Incrustation and Decoration (113) The Incrustation motifs originate from the same historical architectural influences as the structure of the building: a few were adopted from the ancient Roman mosaic floors that ran through the foundation of the baptistery; others grew out of the early Christian art of the 4th and 5th centuries; and still others from the Byzantine art of 6th to 11th centuries (114). The luxurious styles of the antique, late antique-early Christian, and Byzantine-early Medieval were just precursors that were translated into the rigor of the High Middle Ages, and indeed likely were connected with the late Byzantine precursors of the middle of the 11th century at S. Marco in Venice (115); the multicolored, joyful expansiveness of the precursors changed to a two-colored abstract rigor (116). The architect defined the template that led to the rich development of the Florentine style all the way up to life and times of Arnolfo di Cambio and Giotto (117). In summary, the following can be said: in the effort to re-enliven the forms of the antique, there was as a last thoroughly defining conclusion: the demand for polychrome, whose amazing fulfillment in the building and primarily of the successive ones like it assured its admiration in future generations. Just as was done with the construction system, the colorful decoration grew from Byzantine roots to neoclassical, Italian, and even to a pronounced Florentine style. This colorful decoration would be foundational through the Gothic and early Renaissance period. In the Byzantine-late antique, the fundamental idea of the composition is probably to turn precious materials into a resplendent whole: we see a connection of black-green and white marble on the walls with reddish Cipollino and gilding on the columns and with mosaic decoration on the cupola, on the architrave and on the gallery balustrades (118). This works in contrast to the attempt to bring these decorations in harmony with the tectonic framework, whose function it is to underline and break up these decoration elements. There, the architect of the Baptistery again went significantly beyond the familiar, standard accomplishments of his contemporaries in Pisa and Venice, and also beyond the Antique itself. Only at the Baptistery and other Florentine buildings done in a similar style are columns, pilasters, entablatures, and arches drawn out through materials of different colors and from the base surface. Only there were the individual parts of these building elements again differentiated, and only there the surface pattern succeeds in filling the outline of the boldly stressed partitioning system. The Flooring Complete with colorful marble Incrustation; the richest example of a medieval marble floor in Florence. The simpler, carpet-like, purely flat patterns probably did not originate from the 12th century. Rather, the more complete and perspective motifs (cubes, zigzags, etc.) originated in the 13th and 14th centuries. All of it is has been abundantly restored. In the southeast quarter of the building, a zodiac and other figural motifs in the style of the 1207 flooring of San Miniato date the floor (119). The Choir Chapel (La Scarsella); 1202 ff. A horizontal rectangular chapel on the west side of the octagon. In the four corners, there are four columns, and above that, a groin vault  a motif that was a precursor in ancient Roman baths. The capitals and the very colorful, easily joined Incrustation decoration come across as crude: they originate from the beginning of the end of the Incrustation style (120). Closing Appraisal No other Florentine construction so comprehensively and so perfectly manifested all that Florentine art valued across all ages: strict spirituality that had been developed since the Middle Ages in the Christian Occident; magnificence of Mediterranean cultures which maintained the legacy of Byzantium; but above all, a near-natural, simple, and yet still wonderful, fine, and beautiful structure built in the spirt of the ancient Roman classics. That is why this Temple of the holy patron saint of Florence, the bel San Giovanni (so named by Dante due to his loving nature), for all times has been considered the symbol of the city of Florence, its spirit, and its self-assurance (121). Baugeschichte S. Giovanni Das Baptisterium ist noch immer eines der groen Rtsel der Architekturgeschichte. Schon seit dem hohen Mittelalter ein Lieblingsgegenstand der historischen Phantasie,wird es bis auf den heutigen Tag von ernsten Gelehrten bald ins vierte und fnfte Jahrhundert, bald ins siebente und achte, bald ins elfte, zwlfte, dreizehnte, oder gar fnfzehnte Jahrhundert datiert, so da seine Ansetzung noch immer um ein volles Jahrtausend schwankt. Allgemein aufgegeben ist nur die lteste, schon im Zeitalter Dantes nachweisbare These, der Bau sei eine Schpfung der rmsichen Antike, etwa ein Marstempel (2). Aufzugeben ist meiner Meinung nach auch die noch ltere, bereits im frhen 13. Jahrhunder nachweisbare Datierung in die frhschristliche Epoche (3). Nur bedingt richtig ist schlielich die Hypothese eines Ursprungs in langobardischer Zeit (4); ebenso bedingt annehmbar nur auch jene andere Hypthese der Grndung im elften oder zwlften Jahrhundert (5); ganz falsch die Legende von wesentlichen Zufgungen der Frhrenaissance (6). Ich grnde meine Darstellung auf die Dokumente und den Baubefund, vor allem aber auf die Ergebnisse der Leider sehr unvollstndigen Ausgrabungen des letzten Halbjahrunderts (7). Unter der Kirche befinden sich Reste von drei lteren Kulturschichten. Erstens Reste eines rmischen Palastes, der wohl in augusteischer Zeit errichtet und noch in rmischer Zeit zerstrt wurde. Zweitens, in den Ruinen dieses Palastes eingenistet, Reste von sptantiken Wohnhusern und Thermen, die ebenfalls zerstrt wurden (aber erst nach dem Ende des 4. Jahrhunderts). Drittens Grber wurde vondem Fundament des linken Eckpfeilers der Baptisteriumsapsishalb zerstrt (8).  Zugang zu den Ausgrabungen: in der Apsis. Eine Johanneskirche im nordstlichen Winkel des rmischen Mauerringes, also an der heutigen Stelle, wird urkundlich erwhnt zuerst 897 (9), und dann 909, 967, 990, und 1040 (10). Mglicherweise war sie ursprnglich Baptisterium und Konkathedrale der hlg. Reparata: sptestens um die Mitte des 11. Jahrhunderts trat sie die Kathedralen wrde aber ganz an die vor ihr liegende Basilika S. Reparata abund diente seither ausschlielich als Taufkirche und Stift der Domkanoniker (11). Vielleicht stand dieser Wechsel in Zusammenhangdamit, da damals einschneidende Vernderungen an dem Bau bewirkt wurden. 1059 oder 1061 nahm Papst Nikolaus II., Exbischof von Florenz, anscheinend eine Weihe in S. Giovanni vor, und zwar wahrscheinlich die Grunsteinweihe fr einen monumentalen Neubau (12). Die Bauttigkeit scheint dann ein volles Jahrhundert angedauert zu haben. 1113 mu das Erdgescho bereits groenteils fertig gewesen sein, da man an einem seiner Wnde den Bischof Rainer beisetzte, dessen lange Regierungsttigkeit (1077-1113) eng mit den ersten groen Fortschritten des Neubaus verbunden gewesen sein mag (13). 1117 waren die Arbeiten offenbar noch im Gang, denn zu ihrer Frderung doch wohl schenkten die Pisaner den Florentinern zwei Sulen, die dann vor dem Gebude aufgestellt wurden (14). 1128 wurde das Erdgeschlo anscheinend in Benutzung genommen (15). 1150 beschlo die Aufsetzung der Laterne den Kuppelbau, der 1128 vielleicht auch schon im wesentlichen fertig gewesen war (16), und damit das ganze Bauunternehmen (17). Schon um diese Zeit scheint die Calimalazunft, die Zunft der Kaufleute, den Bau und die Bauhtte, die weiter bestehen blieb, detreut zu haben (18). Nachttrglich wurden an der fertigen Kirche noch einige nicht unwesentliche Vernderungen vorgenommen. 1202 ersetzte man die halbkreisfrmige Apsis durch eine rechtickige Chorkapelle, die sogenannte Scarsella (19). Um 1207 war der Marmorfuboden in Arbeit (20). In der zweiten Hlfte des 13. Jahrhunderts erhielt die groe Kuppel ihren Mosaikschmuck (21).  In den achtziger und neunziger Jahren endlich wurde das Baptisterium ein letztes Mal zum Gegenstand grerer architecktonischer Projekte, und zwar im Zusammenhang mit der Neugestaltung des Domes und des Domplatzes. 1285 begann man mit der Herstellung eines neuen Pflasters auf dem Platz (22), 1293 oder 1296 inkrustierte Arnolfo di Cambio nach Beseitigung vieler Grabdenkmler die bis dahin aus grauem Haustein (Macigno) bestehenden ueren Eckpfeiler des Oktogons mit schwarzgrnen und weien Marmorschichten; wahrscheinlich wollte er dadurch die Taufkirche seiner neuen, stark mit diesem Mittel wirkenden Domfassade anpassen; er erneuerte anscheinend auch das obere Profil der Basis des Baptisteriums (23). Seither ist S. Giovanni nur mehr restauriert worden, allerdings sehr hufig und ziemlich durchgreifend. 1339 reinigte man den verschmutzten Marmarbelag und erneuerte die oberste Ornamentleiste des Kranzgesimses (24). 1341-46, 1364, 1389/90 fanden Reparaturen am Marmordach statt (25). 1444-1471 mute der Plattenbelag des Daches noch einmal unvollstndig erneuert werden (26). Lionardo da Vinci soll das ganze Gebude mechanisch in die Luft haben heben wollen, um einen Sockel darunter setzen zu knnen (27). 1515 wurde aus statischen Grnden in Hhe des zweiten Gesimses eine Kette in das Mauerwerk eingelassen (28). 1548 fanden weitere, nicht genauer definierte Restaurierungen statt (29). 1577 entfernte Buontalenti trotz heftigster Proteste der Brgerschaft das mittelalterliche Taufecken und den dauzugehrigen Kanonikerchor aus dem Kirchenraum, um Platz fr eine Taufdekoration zu Ehren des Don Filippo, des Erstgeborenen des groherzogs Francesco I., zu schaffen (30); es war die schwerste Verstmmelung, die das Gebude je erlitten hat. 1722 lieen die Kanoniker einen Sakristeiraum in die Apsis einbauen und davor neue Chorschranken errichten (31). Um 1782 reinigte der ARchitekt Giuseppe Manetti das Gebude und erneuerte das Sockelgesims (32). 1895-1902 wurde das Steinwerk der Laterne, der Tribuna und der Ostseite des Oktogons auseinandergenommen und neu zusammengefgt (33). Damals und 1912/15 entfernte man die barocken Zutaten in der Apsis und an den Altren. 1887 wurde die nordwestliche Hlfte der Piazza S. Giovanni ausgegraben, 1895/97 die sdwestliche Hlfte, und 1912/15 wurden die verschiedenen Bauschichten unter der Westhlfte der Kirche freigelegt (34).Eine vllige Klrung der Baugeschichte kann nur durch Erforschung der brigen, einstweilen unberhrten Gelndeteile unter dem Baptisterium und dem Platz erreicht werden. Anmerkungen (1) Dokument von 899: Geschichte von Florenz I, 1896, 73. (2) Die Vorstellung, S. Giovanni sei ursprglich ein Tempel des angeblichen heidnischen Stadtpatrons von Florenz, des Mars, gewesen und sei dann dem jngeren, christlichen Stadtpatron, dem Tufer Johannes, zu Ehren umgeweiht worden, liegt schon einigen Versen Dantes zugrunde (Inferno XIII, 143, 156; XIX, 16; vgl. darber Lumachi, Mem. stor. 1782, 4; Gruyer, Les oeuvres dart de la Renaissance au Temple de St. Jean, 1875, 271). Der Meinung Dantes folgte sein Kommentator Boccaccio (Richa V, 1757, XXVII). Giovanni Villani (lib. I, cap. XLII und LX) gab dieser Legende eine bestimmtere Form, indem er behauptete, das Bauwerk sei zur Zeit des Augustus von stadtrmischen Bauleuten zu Ehren des Mars errichtet und zur Zeit Papst Silvesters und Kaiser Konstantins in eine Kirche des Tufers verwandelt worden; deutlich lt dabei seine Erwhnung der hnlichkeit zwischen S. Giovanni und dem Pantheon den Anla zur Bildung dieser Legende erkennen. Unter den Anhngern dieser These im 14. Jahrhundert werden noch Petrarca und Franco Sacchetti gennant, unter denen des 15. Jahrhunderts Matteo Palmieri und Polizian (Richa V, 1757, VI, und andere), und wir knnen zu den letzteren noch den um 1475 schreibenden Piero Cennini fgen (Riv. dA VI, 1909, 220). Im Cinquecento spricht Albertini von dieser These, und zwar mit einigen Ausschmckungen (Memoriale, 1510, 9); ebenso spielt Vasari darauf an (I, 333, VIII, 425), und auch Poccianti (Vite desette Beati Fiorentini, 1589, 140). Besonders aber verlieh der hochgelehrte Vincenzo Borghini der Marstempeltheorie eine hhere Wirksamkeit, indem er auf Crund des antikiserenden Charackters der Bauformen die Gegenmeinung zu entkrften versuchte, S. Giovanni knne im langobardischer Zeit als Taufkirche gegrndet sein, und indem er eine zeichnerische Rekonstruktion des von ihm vermuteten ursprnglichen Zustands seines Marstempels gab (Discorsi, I, 1584, 145ff., 149f., 153, 154, 156f., 162; siehe auch den Brief vom 23. XI. 1564 bei Gaye, III, 1840, 158). Cinelli suchte auf Grund einer handschriftlichen Chronik in der Laurenziana die Entstehung des Baus auf das Jahr 35 nach Chrsiti Geburt festzulegen (Bocchi-Cinelli, 1677, 25). Zuletzt nahm noch Richa an, wenigstens die uere Mauerschale knne von einem Marstempel brig geblieben sein (V, 1757, XII, XIII).  Die Marstempelthese wurde dann im 17. und 18. Jahrhundert durch die Beobachtung erschttert, da die achteckige Form von S. Giovanni nicht aus dem heidnischen, wohl aber aus dem christlichen Kult erklrt werden knne, und da in dem Bau vielfach Spoilien aus zerstrten rmischen Bauten verwendet worden sind, da er also aus mittelalterlicher Zeit stammen msse (Del Migliore, 1684, 82, 84; Lami Lezioni, I, 135; und andere). Im 19. Jahrhundert wurde diese Beweisfhrung, fortgesetzt und vertieft (vgl. vor allem Hbsch, Die altchristlichen Kirchen etc., 1862, Spalte 41 ff. und Nardini, S. Giovanni, 1902, 7, 8).  Endgltig widerlegt wurde die Marstempel-These erst durch die Ausgrabungen des 19. und 20. Jahrhunderts, die unter den Grundmauern des Baptisteriums zu oberst einen Friedhof aus der Vlkerwanderungszeit, dann Gebudereste aus sptrmischer Epoche und zu unterst Reste eines Palastes aus frhkaiserlicher Zeit zutage frderten (1. Jahrh. nach Christi Geburt?). Vgl. unten Anm. 8 und Swoboda, Kunstwissenschaftliche Forschungen II, 1933, 64.  Ich gebe als Anhang noch einen berblick, wie die genannten Autoren sich den hypothetischen Marstempel vorstellen. Vorbild der rekonstruierenden Phantasie war zugegebenermaen das Pantheon. So vermutete Giovanni Villani, das Gebude habe in heidnischer Zeit keine Apsis gehabt und keine Laterne, sondern eine unbedeckte Kreisffnung im Scheitel der Kuppel (lib. I, cap. LX). Schon frh gesellte sich zu diesen antikischen Zgen noch der aus Vitruv als typisch bekannte Stufensockel, das Podium (Piero Cennini, 1475; vgl. Riv. dA. VI, 1909, 221), und der ebenfalls durch die inzwischen vertieften archologischen Kenntnisse erforderte Porticus im Westen (Vincenzo Borghini, Discorsi I, 1584, 163, 164). In diesem Stadium wurde die Theorie durch die Holzschnitte Borghinis veranschaulicht. Abhngig von Borghini vor allem Bocchi-Cinelli (1677, 26) und Del Migliore (1684, 88f., 97), der aber doch schon einige Kritik bt. Eine neue und letzte, mehr an den rmischen Amphitheatern orientierte Holzschnitt-Rekonstruktion gab Richa (V, 1757, XII, XIII). Foll.-Rastr. erwhnen noch eine gemalte Rekonstruktion (III, 1791, 11). Vgl. auch Lumachi, Mem. stor. 1782. 13f. (3) Die These der Entstehung des Baptisteriums in frhchristlicher Zeit ist noch etwas lter als die Marstempel-These. Schon im frhen 13. Jahrh. besagte die Chronica de origine civitatis, S. Giovanni sei nach der Zerstrung der Stadt durch Totila von rmischen Meistern erbaut worden, und zwar in Nachahmung von S. Giovanni in Laterano (siehe Swoboda, Baptisterium, 1918, 64). Hundert Jahre spter verbesserte Ricordano Malespini Giovanni Villanis These dahin, da der Bau zur Zeit des Todes Christi zu Ehren des Johannes erbaut worden sei (Istoria fiorentina, ed. Livorno, 1830, I, cap. 38, 82). Im 16. Jahrhundert vertrat Girolamo Mei dieselbe Meinung gegenber Vincenzo Borghini (vgl. darber Manni, Principii della religione cristiana, 1764, 73/74). Damals vertiefte Del Migliore noch diese These durch Erneuerung des uralten Hinweises auf die hnlichkeit des Baus mit anderen Baptisterien wie S. Giovanni in Laterano, Pisa, Pistoria, Parma etc. (vgl. auch Richa V, 1757, VI). Fr das 18. Jahrhundert vgl. Gori (Lumachi, Mem. stor. 1782, 6 ff.) und Manni, der die Theorie von der Grndung zu Baptisteriumszwecken noch durch einen Hinweis auf die fr diesen Zweck typische Lage vor der Fassade der Kathedrale betonte (Principii della Religione cristiana, 1764 S. 73/74; Gegengrnde bei del Rosso, Ricerche, 1820, 28f.). Im 19. Jahhundert glaubte G. Cordero den Bau wegen seiner Verwandtschaft mit den antikisierend-byzantinischen Schpfungen Theoderichs und Justinians ins 6. Jahrhundert setzen zu sollen (DellItaliana Architettura durante la dominazione longobarda, Bescia, 1829, 203f.). Ebenso dachten Rumohr und Fergusson an die Mglichkeit eines frhchristlichen Ursprungs (Ital. Forsch. III, 1831, 178, 180; A history of architecture, 1874, I, 437). Mit hchster Energie verfochten wurde diese Meinung aber von Hbsch und Nardini. Hbsch setzte den Kernbau ins 4. oder 5. Jahrhundert, die Bioforien der inneren Empore aber ins 13. Jahrhundert (Detucsches Kunstblatt, 1855, 184ff.; Die altchristlichen Kirchen etc. 1862, Spalte 41 ff.; Gegengrnde bei Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, 61). Nardini baute seine temperamentvoll vorgetragene Hypothese auf historischen Erwgungen auf (Erwhnung des Baptisteriums schon im 8. Jahrhundert. Unwahrscheinlichkeit der Grndung in der rmlichen langobardischen Epoche) und suchte sie durch stilistische Vergleiche mit anderen, hnlichen, frhchristlichen Bauten zu sichern (hnlichkeit mit S. Lorenzo in Mailand und S. Vitale in Ravenna, Absetzung gegen die sicheren Bauten des 11. und 12. Jahrhunderts wie S. Miniato etc); vgl. A. e st. VII, 1888, 129ff., 132 ff. und S. Giovanni,1902, 4ff., 16ff., 39ff., 46/47ff., 76, 78, 79-81, 87, 100 etc. Wie Nardini urteilte auch Reymond (La sculpture florentine II, 1898, 79/80). Gegen ihn argumentierten berzeugend Davidsohn, der die Haltlosigkeit der historischen Grundlagen Nardinis nachwies (Forschungen z. G. Florenz IV, 1908, 461) und Supino (Gli Albori, 1906, 26-34, 47). In denselben Jahren ergaben die Ausgrabungen das rmische Wohnungen standen und da sich in der folgenden Vlkerwanderungszeit dort ein Friedhof entwickelte, dessen Datierung zwischen dem 6. und 8. Jahrhundert strittig ist (vgl. unten Anm. 8). Damit ist der frhchristlichen These endgltig der Boden entzogen. Doch hat sie noch immer Anhnger, wie Venturi (Storia I, 1901, 103), Toesca (Storia III, 1927, 105ff. und 648ff.), Rupp, Inkrustationsstil, 1912, 24, 58 ff., und Anthony, Art Stud. V, 1927, 107. (4) Fr einen langobardischen Ursprung des Baptisteriums erklrte sich zuerst G. B. Nelli, indem er auf den Johanneskult der Langobarden hinwies (Piante ed alzati di S. Maria del Fiore IV, 34, 37; Exzerpte bei Richa V, 1755, VIIf. und Rupp, Inkrustationsstil, 1912, 23, 24). Lami przisierte diese Theorie dahin, da die Knigin Theolinde den Tufer zum Schutzpatron des Reichs erwhlt habe und da die Florentiner diesem Regierungsakt zuliebe ihren Johannesdom gegrndet htten (Mon. II, 1758, 937ff.; Lezioni dantichit cristiane, 1766, I, 59/60; abgedruckt bei Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, 53f.). Lamis Theorie grndet sich wohl auf eine Stelle ber den Johanneskult der Langobarden bei Paulus Diakonus (Bald. I, 76 ff.). Der Meinung Lamis folgten: Paciaudi, De cultu S. Jo. Baptistae, 1755, 14; Lastri, Oss. 1777, II, 51: Lumachi, Mem. stor. 1782, 7ff.; Foll.-Rastr. III, 1791, 11; dAgincourt, Historie de lart par les monumens I, ARchitecture 1811-23, 119; M. I. Isabelle, Les difices circulaires et les dmes, 1855, 105; Prezzolini, Storia politico-religiosa del popolo fiorentino I, 1865, 93; I. Fergusson, A history of architecture I, 1874, 437; Hartwig, Quellen zur Geschichte von Florenz I, 1875, 82; G. B. Befani, Mem. stor. 1884, 15; R. Cattaneo, Larchitettura in Italia dal secolo VI al mille, 1888, 46f.; A e st. XVI, 1897, 100.- Energisch besttigt wurde diese Meinung  unter Heranziehung von Urkunden aus langobardischer Zeit, die das Florentiner Baptisterium erwhnen!  von Davidsohn und Frey, und zwar noch einmal besttigt in dem (irrigen) Sinne, da das heutige Gebude mit Ausnahme der Inkrustation langobardisch sei (Geschichte von Florenz I, 1896, 41, 72; Forschungen z. G. Florenz I, 1896 146; Loggia deLanzi, 1885, 62; Vasari I, 1911, 576f.) So auch Behne, Inkrustationsstil in Toscana, 1912, 90/91 und Milani, Annali dIngegneria e Architettura, 1918.  Die Gegengrnde gegen die langobardische These hat G. Cordero zusammengestellt (Dellitaliana architettura durante la dominazione longobarda, Bescia, 1829, 203f.) Vgl. auch Schnaase, Geschichte der bildenden Knste im Mittelalter I, 1871, 442 und vor allem Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, 46 sowie Swoboda, Baptisterium, 1918, 60. Der Stil der Konstruktion und der Dekoration des jetzigen Baus verbietet eine Ansetzung vor dem 11. Jahrhundert (vgl. unten). Doch bliebt als brauchbarer Gewinn dieser These, da das Vorhandensein eines lteren langobardischen Baus an dieser Stelle dokumentarisch bewiesen worden ist (vgl. auch unten). (5) Kugler meinte, die 1117 erfolgte Schenkung von zwei Sulen an die Florentiner durch die Pisaner msse als ein Beitrag Zum Bau des Baptisteriums aufgefat werden; der Baubeginn knne also um 1117 angesetzt werden, der Abschlu des Baus um 1150 (Villani: Aufsetzungetnug der Laterne); vgl. Geschichte der Baukunst II, 1858, 58f. (Polemik daran anschlieen: Hbsch, im Deutschen Kunstblatt, 1855, l84ff.; Kugler ebenda, S. 228; wie Hbsch auch Forschungen z. G. Florenz I, 1896, 24). Der Meinung von Kugler schlossen sich folgende Autoren an: Burckhardt (Cicerone I, 1860, 110: mit Herabrckung ins Ende des 12. Jahrhunderts); Lbke in den Mitteilungen der k. k. Zentral-Kommission V, 1860, 169 (mit Zurckdatierung ins 11. Jahrhundert); Schnaase (Mitteilungen der k. k. Zentralkommission, 1860, V, 169; Geschichte der Baukunst IV, 1871, 442: mit Zurckdatierung ins 11. Jahrhundert), Dehio-v. Bezold (Kirchliche Baukunst des Abendlandes, I, 1892, 544).  Diese Meinung litt an dem Fehler, da die Dokumente aus der Zeit vor dem II. Jahrhundert nicht bercksichtigt wurden (auer von Schanaase), die das Vorhandensein eines lteren Baus bewiesen. Andererseits brachten sie berzeugende und dokumentarisch besttige Beweisgrnde fr die Datierung des heutigen Baus bei. Beide Argumentgruppen bercksichtigte dann zuerst Supino, dessen Beweisfhrung ich weiter zu entwickeln versuche. (6) Rupp, Inkrustationsstil, 1912 (S. 80 und an vielen anderen Stellen). Diese These knnte fr sich in Anspruch nehmen, da ein Wappen des frhen 15. Jahrhunderts im Hof des Bargello das Baptisterium ohne die Attika zeigt. Doch beweisen die Fresken des 14. Jahrhunderts im Bigallo und im Hof von S. Croce, sowie die Truhe aus dem frhen 15. Jahrhundert im Bargello eindeutig, da die Attika damals schon vorhanden war. Die Dokumente des Trecento beweisen ferner, da Attika und Dach damals bereits erneuerungsbedrftig, also schon sehr alt waren.  Rupps Beweisfhrung verdient keine ernstliche Widerlegung. Ihr folgte  unbegreiflicherweise!  Frankl (Handbuch fr Kunstwissenschaft, Die frhmittelalterliche und romanische Baukunst, 1926, 225). (7) Mein Ausgangspunkt ist die auf synthetische Untersuchungen gesttzte, alle frheren Argumente zusammenfassende These Supinos, da das Baptisterium in langobardischer Zeit gegrndet, im 11. und 12. Jahrhundert aber von Grund auf erneuert worden sei. Fr den Ursprung des Gebudes wies Supino auf die Dokumente hin, fr die Erneuerung auf den stilistischen Charakter des Baus, dessen Verwandtschaft mit datierten Bauten des 11. Jahrhunderts (Empoli usw.) und dessen entwickelte Formen eine solche Ansetzung erforden (Gli Albori, 1906, 18 ff., 26ff., 53f., 56f., 58.; nicht stichhaltige Gegengrnde bei Frey-Vasari I, 1911, 580 und Anthony, ARt Stud. V, 1927, 108). Vgl. auch Testi e Rodolico, Le arti figurative nella storia dItalia, 1907, 322. Swoboda suchte mit vllig verfehlten stilkritischen Darlegungen die von Supino gegebenen Daten dahin zu variieren, da der beschlu zum Neubau 1050 gefat worden sei (Baptisterium, 1918, 74ff.); gegen ihn sprechen die Dokumente und er Stil, vgl. unten. Wie Swoboda urteilte auch Frankl, Die frhmittelalterliche Baukunst, 1926, 224. Beenken rckte den Bau in die zweite Hlfte des 10. und in die erste Hlfte des 11. Jahrhunderts (Z.f.b. K. LX, 1926/27, 250ff.). Salmi setzte ihn meines Erachtens viel richtiger in die zweite Hlfte des 11. Jahrhunderts (Arch. rom. 9). Meine Darstellung sicht die Datierung Supinos und Salmis durch Bercksichtigung neuer Anhaltspunke zu erhrten. (8) Wegen der Bedeutung dieser Reste sollen die im Haupttext gemachten kurzen Andeutung hier noch genauer erlutert werden. ber dem Gelnde des Baptisteriums und des heute verschwundenen Ostflgels des bischflichen Palastes ist in frhkaiserlicher Zeit ein groer, mosaikgeschmckter Palast erbaut worden der von den Archologen hypothetisch als Prtorium angesprochen wird, d. h. als Amtssitz des Kommandanten der rmischen Militrkolonie Florenz. Dieser Palast mu dann zerstrt worden sein und seine Trmmer den Einflssen der Witterung lange dargeboten haben. In spt-antiker Zeit wurden seine berreste zur Errichtung rmlicher Wohnungen und Thermen verwendet, die nach Magabe von Mnzfunden noch im 5. Jahrhundert nach Christi Geburt in Benutzung waren: Mnze des Kaisers Honorius (Regierungszeit 395423). Spter mssen auch sie zerstrt worden sein (wohl von den Goten). In dem allmhlich ber ihren Resten sich ansammelnden Erdreich wurde schlielich von Germanen (Goten oder Langobarden: charakteristische Grabfunde!) ein Friedhof angelegt, der das ganze oben abgegrenzte Areal berdeckte. Die Zeit, in der das geschah, ist strittig. Nach Gallis Meinung, die sich auf den Typus der Grber und auf den Stil ihrer Beigaben sttzt, kme das 6./7. Jahrhundert in Frage; nach Toesca dagegen bereits das spte 5. Jahrhundert (vgl. die Polemik Galli-Tarchiani-Toeaca in Marzocco, 1917). Htte Toesca recht, so knnte das Baptisterium, das auf diesem Friedhof errichtet wurde und ihn z. T. zerstrte, bereits im 6. Jahrhundert gegrndet worden sein (vgl. auch Toesca, Storia, 1927, lO5ff.). Doch scheint mir Toescas Frhdatierung der Grber milungen (so auch Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 101). Wie Horn richtig fordert, mte die Datierung der Grber noch einmal von frhgeschichtlicher Seite her sachkundig untersucht und genauer geklrt werden.

Jahrhundert vgl. Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 110, Anm. 2. Die Entstehungszeit dieses ltesten Baptisteriums kann nach oben, gegen die Sptantike hin, abgegrenzt werden durch das Datum des germanische Friedhofs; diese Datum lieglt schwerlich vor dem 6. Jahrhundert und vielleicht erst im 7. Jahrhundert (vgl. vorige Anm.). Dies bliebt bestehen, auch wenn es nicht die Mauern des Grndungsbaus waren, die eines der Germanengrber zerstrten (so urteilte Galli), sondern die Fundamente des Erneuerungsbaus aus dem 11. Jahrhundert (wie es meines Erachtens der Augenschein lehrt): denn die Grber nehmen offenbar noch keine Rcksicht auf einen Kirchenbau, unter dem und um den herum sie an sich mglicherweise angelegt sein knnten. Die Ausgrabungen besttigen also die Theorie des langobardischen Ursprungs der Kirche und schlieen eine Entstehung vor dem spten 5. Jahrhundert aus. So jetzt auch Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 100.  Ob die jetzigen Fundamente des Baptisteriums langobardisch sind oder ob sie aus dem 11./12. Jahrhundert stammen, bzw. ob in dem jetzigen, offensichtlich groenteils aus dem 11./12. Jahrhundert herrhrenden Fundament-Oktogon ein lteres, langobardisches stekt (was sehr wahrscheinlich sein drfte), ist bei der vgl. darber unter Rekonstruktion Anm. 35.  Die langobardische Johanneskirche lag in einem Winkel des Mauerrings, hnlich wie der Pisaner Dombezirk, nicht aber auerhalb der Mauern, wie manchmal behauptet worden ist (vgl. darber Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, 55f. und den Plan bei Rupp, Inkrustationsstil, 1912, 44).

Auszuscheiden ist Richas Nachricht (V, 1755, XXV), der Astrologe Strozzo Strozzi habe 1048 den Zodiakus im Fuboden von S. Giovanni anlegen lassen; der Zodiakus kann aus stilistischen Grnden erst um 1207 (Fuboden von S. Miniato) entstanden sein. (11) Fr die Kathedraltheorie sprechen die Dokumente, die bis zur Mitte des 11. Jahrhunderts das Florentiner Bistum nach Johannes dem Tufer benennen, dann eine Zeitlang nach Johannes und nach der hlg. Reparata, und erst seit dem 12. Jahrhundert ausschlielich nach der letzteren. Gegen diese Theorie spricht die achteckige Form, die S. Giovanni von Anfang an zur Taufkirche bestimmt erscheinen lt, und die Tatsache, da die Basilika der hlg. Reparata genau in der Lage und Gestalt gegrndet wurde, die ein Dom im Verhltnis zu seiner Taufkirche in dieser Zeit gewhnlich hatte. Vgl. ber diese Frage unter S. Maria del Fiore und S. Reparata; siehe auch vor allem folgende Literatur: Del Migliore, 1684, 87; Lami, Mon. II, 1758, 937f.; Lumachi, Mem. stor. 1782, 15ff. Cianforgni, S. Lorenzo, 50ff.; Del Rosso, Richerche, 1820, 28ff.; Frey, Loggia deLanzi, 1885, 62, 63; Geschichte von Florenz I, 1896, 72, 73, 337; Nardini, 1902, 68ff.; 75ff.; Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, 27ff., 49, 57/58; Frey-Vasari I, 1911, 578f.; Rupp, Inkrustationsstil, 1912, 28ff., Swoboda, 1918, 59, 62 (ganz irrig); C. W. Anthony, Art Stud. V, 1927, 103, 105.  Galli hielt irrtmlich die Fundamente des Taufbeckens des 12. Jahrhunderts fr langobardisch (Riv. dA. IX, 1916/18, 182). (12) ber dieses Datum vgl. neuerdings Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 112. Seine Darlegung sei hier wiedergegeben, da sie alle einschlgigen Probleme vorbildlich klarlegt. Das Dokument der Weihe ist verloren oder hat niemals existiert. Davidsohn (Geschichte von Florenz 1, 1896, 218, Anm. 3) hat in der Sakristei des Baptisteriums ein von ,, ,,einer Hand des 17. oder 18. Jahrhunderts geschriebenes  Verzeichnis der Feste von S. Giovanni gesehen, in dem unter dem 6. November 1059 die Dedikation der Kirche durch Nikolaus II. angefhrt war (Verbleib unbekannt). Die Weihe ist schon erwhnt bei Del Migliore, 1684, 111, nur wird dort als Datum statt des 6. November 1059 der 6. November 1061 angegeben. Nach Del Migliore, der sich auf Ughelli beruft (Italia sacra III, wo ich eine entsprechende Erwhnung nicht finden kann), stammt diese Nachricht von dem Senatore Carlo Strozzi, ,, ,,che fra le scritture del monastero di S. Felicit ve ne trovasse una, che mostrava essersi stata fatta tale funzione, per mano dun papa che fu Niccol II (quelli che era stato vescovo di Firenze sotto il nome di Gherardo di Borgogne) nel anno secondo del suo pontificato, che cade nel 1061. Der 6. November ist  Hinweis Davidsohns  als Weihtag von S. Giovanni schon in den am Ende des 12. Jahrhundersts. geschriebenen Rubricae ecclesiasticae, Cod. Riccard. 3005 (3138), f. 96a angefhrt, dort aber ohne Jahrsangabe, und weiterhin  aber auch hier ohne Jahresangabe  in den wahrscheinlich zwischen 1228 und 1332 geschreibenen Mores et Consuetudines canonicae florentinae (vgl. dazu acuh Nardini, S. Giovanni, 1902, und Supino, Gli albori, 1906, 61f.).  Die berlieferung behlt, da der Zusammenhang von Tages- und Jahresdatum nicht gesichert ist, doch immerhin etwas Zweifelhaftes, trotz des Alteres der Tagesfeier und trotz dem Hinweis Del Migliores auf eine angeblich von dem Senatore Strozzi unter den Schriften von S. Felicit gefundes Dokument mit jenem Datum. - Frey kannte den hier dargelegten Sachverhalt, hielt ihn aber merkwrdigerweise fr vllig unverbindlich, da ihm die Vornahme einer so wichtigen Weihe an einem Sonnabend (statt Sonntag) unwahrscheinlich vorkam (Vasari I, 1911, 577). Auch Davidsohn und Swoboda (Baptisterium, 1918, 63) zweifelten an der Zuverlssigkeit des Datums. Ihnen und Frey widersprach mit berzeugenden Grnden Salmi (Arch. rom. S. 37). Er meinte jedoch (S. 35), der Neubau knne bei der Weihe von 1059 noch nicht gut vollendet gewesen sein. Ich gehe in dieser Richtung noch weiter, indem ich die Weihe als eine Anfangsweihe, nicht aber als eine Schluweihe deute, und werde dazu durch die Tatsache angeregt, da noch bis 1150 fortdauernd Bauarbeiten in Gang waren (vgl. unten). Diese Tatsache ist auch ein Hauptgrund gegen die stilistisch ebenfalls unhaltbare Datierung Beenkens (10. Jahrh. 1. Hlfte 11. Jahrh.: Z. f. b. K. LX, 1926/27, 250f. - Damit wende ich mich auch gegen Swobodas Berichtigung seiner lteren These, die darauf hinausluft, das Datum 1059 sei zuverlssig, bezeichne aber die Vollendung des langobardischen Baus, nicht die Begrndung der jetzigen Kirche (Kunstwissensch. Forschungen II, 1933, 74). - Horn (a. a. O., 1938, 112/113) legte die berlieferung des Datums in der oben wiedergebenen Weise klar und kam zu dem Schlu, das Datum sei immerhin zweideutig und zweifelhaft, und es bliebe noch zu klren, ob es philologisch zu REcht als Termin einer Grndungsweihe gedeutet werden knne. Dennoch stimmte Horn meiner Annahme zu, das heutige Baptisterium msse um 1059/61 begonnen sein (a. a. O., 1938, 113/114). Seine Grnde sind folgende: Erstens die Verwandtschaft des jetzigen Baus mit S. Miniato, bzw. mit den Teilen dieser Kirche, die im zweiten Drittel des 11. Jahrhunderts entstanden. Zweitens die Tatsache, da die Baptisteriumskapitelle etwas jnger wirken als die Kapitelle der romanischen Kirche S. Felicit, die ebenfalls von Papst Nikolaus II. eingeweht wurde, und zwar einen Tag nach der angeblichen Grundsteinweihe von S. Giovanni  am 7. November 1059. Dritten mu der Bau, wie die zusammenhngende, zsurenlose Entwicklungsfolge seiner Kapitelltypen beweist, in einer einzigen zusammenhngenden und nicht allzu langen Baufhrung errichtet worden sein, und das heit, da er schwerlich vor der Mitte des 11. Jahrhunderts begonnen sein kann, da seine Kuppel 1128 anhernd vollendet und 1150 ganz fertig war (vgl. unten)j. Viertens sprechen allgemeine Grnde geschichtlicher und kirchengeschichtlicher Art dafr, da das Baptisterium zur Zeit Papst Nikolaus II. entstand. Diese von Horn angedeutete Auffassung, ber die er weitere Aufstze ankndigt, habe ich 1935 in einem noch unverffentlichten Aufsatz entwickelt und diesen Aufsatz seinerzeit Horn zu Verfgung gestellt. Sie wird jetzt in dem Mitt. Inst. Florenz verffentlicht (Jahrgang 1940). (13) Die Regierungsdaten Rainers sind dessen Grabschrift entnommen (abgedruckt bei Swoboda, Baptisterium, 1918, 4). Dieses Grabmal und das verwandte, 1096 datierbare Grabmal des Grafen Wilhelm Bulgarus, der Cilla und des Uguccione in der Badia a Settimo, sowie die 1093 datierte Fassade der Collegiata in Empoli,  diese ganze sicher datierte Denkmlergruppe aus den neunziger Jahren des 11. Jahrhunderts ist der wichtigste HInweis daruf, da das hnlich inkrustierte Baptisterium im spten 11. und frhen 12. Jahrhundert entstanden sein mu. Swoboda hat freilich versucht, einen stilistischen Unterschied zwischen dieser Gruppe und dem Baptisterium zu konstruieren und dadurch das letztere fr eine Schpfung der zweiten Hlfte des 12. Jahrhundert zu erklren. Seine Beweisfhrung lt sich aber durch die einfache Beobachtung widerlegen, da das Grabmal Rainers 1113 vor die bereits fertige Wand gesetzt wurde, und da die Inkrustationen seines Sockels auf die Basen der angrenzenden Sulen Rcksicht nehmen, da die Architektur des Erdgeschosses von S. Giovanni, damals also bereits vorhanden war. Das Quadratmuster des Sockels ist auf eine Ausdehnung berechnet, die kleiner ist als die Ausdehnung des Sarkophags. Das umgekehrte wre natrlich. Die Unregelmigkeit lt sich nur dadurch erklren, da man von vornherein auf die Sule Rcksicht nahm, deren Basis den Platz in der Sockelzone beengte. Vgl. dazu jetzt auch Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 111. (14) Diese Sulen wurden 1117 von den Pisanern aus Maiorca mitgebracht und den Florentinern geschenkt, zum Dank dafr da sie bei dieser Unternehmung gegen die Araber den Schutz der Stadt Pisa bernommen hatten (Giovanni Villani V, cap. XXXI: es standen auch Bronzetren zur Wahl; Del Migliore, 1684, S. 87). Kugler zuerst vermutete, diese Schenkung sei wohl als Beitrag zur Frderung einer damals in Gang befindlichen, auch in Pisa bekannten Florentiner Bauunternehmung, eben des Baptisteriums, gedacht gewesen (Geschichte der Baukunst II, 58). Diese Deutung bleibt wahrscheinlich, auch wenn die Sulen, wie es geschah, dann nicht eingebaut wurden, was brigens auch darauf schlieen lt, da damals das Erdgescho, wo sie ihrer Gre nach allein hingepat htten, bereits fertig war (Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 111/112). Sie standen bis 1424 auf dem Platz vor dem Baptisterium (abgebildet auf einer Truhe im Museuo Nazionale), wurden dann von einer berschwemmung umgeworften, zerbrachen dabei und wurden links und rechts von der eben von Ghiberti neu dekorierten Ostr aufgestellt. Dort sind sie noch heute zu sehen. Vgl. Del Migliore, 1684, 91f.; Rupp, Inkrustationsstil, 1912 8; Swoboda, Baptisterium, 1918, 70; Salmii, Arch. rom., 37. (l5) Dei Migliore (1684., 87) udd Richa (VI, 8) berichten, um 1128 sei das Kathedralrecht von S. Giovanni auf S. Reparata bertragen und S. Giovanni zur Taufkirche gemacht worden. Lumachi (Mem. stor. 1782, 19, 20) machte auf die vermutliche Quelle dieser lteren Autoren aufmerksam: der Senator Strozzi habe in den Bchern der Calimala-Zunft, der Patronin von S. Giovanni, gelesen, da im Jahre 1128 das Taufbecken vom Dom nach S. Giovanni bertragen worden sei. Diese Nachricht erklrt sich, wie U. Middedorf nachgewiesen hat (unverffentlichte Festschrift zum 60. Geburtstag von Arthur Haseloff, 1933) weniger im Zusammenhang mit dem Wechsel der Kathedralrechte als im Zusammenhang mit den Bauvorgngen. Offenbar war der Neubau des Baptisteriums 1128 weit genug gefrdert, um den zeitweilig in S. Reparata ausgebten Taufdienst wieder bernehmen zu knnen. Vgl. dazu neuerdings auch die eingehende Untersuchung bei Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 109/110.  ber die Glaubwrdigkeit der Auszge Strozzis aus den Akten der Calimala-Zunft vgl. die bernchste Anmerkung. (16) Vgl. Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 110. (17) Giovanni Villani berichtet, da die Laterne 1150 durch die Vorsteher der Calimala-Zunft auf das Gebude aufgesetzt worden sei (lib. I, cap. LX). Diese Nachricht ist ohne Zweifel zuverlssig. Auch Carlo Strozzi notierte sich in seinen Auszgen aus den seither verlorenen Bchern der Calimala-Zunft dasselbe (Frey-Vasari I, 1911, 328). Vgl. auch Borghini, Discorsi I, 1584, 159, 160, 162, 164 mit falschen Folgerungen; Kommentar bei Richa V, 1757, XI); Del Migliore, 1684, 114 (mit falscher Kritik), Lami, Mon. II, 1758, 943f.; Cavallucci, A. e st. VII, 1888, 9; Nardini, S. Giovanni, 1902, 105; Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, 48; Rupp, Inkrustationsstil, 1912, 80 (mit falschen Ergebnissen); Swoboda, Baptisterium, 1918, 65, 66 (mit zu scharfer Kritik); Beenken, Z. f. b. K., LX., 1926/27, 250f.; Anthony, ARt stud. V, 1927, 105. Genauere bersicht ber alle diese Meinungen jetzt bei Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 104. An der Laterne befindet sich eine Inschrift hagiogaphischen Inhalts, deren Schriftcharakter eindeutig auf eine Entstehung in der Mitte des 12. Jahrhunderts weist (Genaueres be Horn, a. a. O. 104-106). Mit der Laterne wird auch die Inkrustation vollendet worden sein, denn sie wirkt merklich lter als die 1203 datierbare Inkrustation der Apsis (genaue stilkritische Untersuchung jetzt bei Horn, a. a. O., 1938, 108) durch die Tatsache, da im Jahre 1205, gelegentlich der bertragung einer Reliquie des Apostels Philippus nach S. Giovanni, der Marmorschmuck des Gebudes als dessen Hauptruhm bezeichnet wird (Geschichte von Florenz I, 1896, 737; Forschungen z. G. Florenz I, 1896, 146, 461f.; Swoboda, Baptisterium, 1918, 1). Davidsohn und nach ihm Frey (Vasari I, 1911, 580) haben die Worte des Textes von 1205 willkrlich nur auf die Inkrustation des Inneren Bezogen, anstatt auf den ganzen Bau. Da dieser in seiner heutigen Gestalt wirklich schon um 1150 fertig dastand, besttig uns auch die Meinung der Chronica de origina civitatis, die bereits im frhen 13. Jahrhundert S. Giovanni als eine Schpfung aus altchristlichen, also lngst vergangenen Zeiten behandelte (Swoboda, 1918, 64).  Die Kuppelkonstruktion scheint sich whrend des Baus oder blad nach seiner Vollendung als unsicher erwiesen zu haben. Man mauerte deshalb angeblich die Belastungssporen hher udn schwerer auf und verdeckte diese Zufgung mit einem Attikagescho. So vermutete jedenfalls Supino, ausgehend von der Beobachtung technischer Unterschide an den Sporen, und Salmi stimmte ihm zu (Gli Albori, 1906, 44ff.; Arch. rom. 37) Mir bleibt etwas unklar, wie man sich dann den ursprglichen Bauplan fr das Dach zu denken hat. Infolge der starken Vorwlbung der inneren Kuppelschale wrde ein tiefer als heute ansetzendes Pyramidendach seine Spitze betrchtlich oberhalb der heutigen Laterne gehabt hahben mssen, wrde also bersteil ausgefallen sein, oder aber die Kuppel wrde, wie in Pisa, hindurchgewachsen sein. Beides scheint mir schlecht zu dem strengen Klassizismus des Florentiner Baus zu stimmen. Vielleicht war die Attika also doch von Anfang an geplant und Supinos Beobachtungen mssen anders gedeutet werden. Stilistisch mute die Inkrustation der Attika ja so wieso am meisten entwickelt ausfallen, da sie am sptesten entstand. Die obere Randlieste ist eine Zufgung des 14. Jahrhunderts (vgl. unten). Seitdem ich diese Zeilen 1934 niederschrieb, hat Horn die Hypothese eines lteren Daches bndig widerlegt (Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 148ff.). (18) Vgl. darber Wackernagel, Lebensraum, 1938, 24, 200, 218, 220, 221. - Nheres siehe Anm. 19, Schlu. (19) Die ltere Literatur nahm an, der Bau habe als Marstempel ein einziges Portal gehabt, das Westportal, und dieses sei dann samt seiner Vorhalle der Verwandlung in einen christlichen Tempel zum Opfer gefallen; damals sei im Westen die Apsis angefgt worden und damals htte man die drei Portale im Sden, Osten und Norden eingebrochen (Giovanni Villani, lib. I cap. LV; Vasari I, 334; Borghini, Discorsi I, 1584, 159; Hbsch, Die altchristlichen Kirchen etc. 1862, Spalte 42; Geschichte von Florenz, I, 1896, 737; Forschungen z. G. Florenz, IV, 1908, 461). Borghini, setzte diese Vernderungen als erster in sptere Zeit, und zwar ins Jahr 1150, offenbar unter Mideutung der Villani-Nachricht vom Bau der Laterne. (Bocchi-) Cinelli datierte den Vorgang um das Jahr 1200 (1677, 26) und Richa rckte ihn ins Jahr 1202, unter Hinweis auf eine entsprchende, vom Senator strozzi kopierte Eintragung in den Bchern der Calimala-Zunft (V, 1757, XVIII, XXXIII, mit genauem Wortlaut). Vielleicht beruht schon Cinellis Datum auf Kenntnis dieser Ricordanz; vgl. ferner Forschungen z. G. Florenz I, 1896, 146. Die Echtheit der Strozzi-Nachricht ist mehrfach bezweifelt worden. Nardini focht sie aus irrigen stilkritischen Grnden an (S. Giovanni, 1902, 80, 81ff., 84ff., 86, 87, 90, 96, 97; A. e st. VII, 1888, 133). Frey wies darauf hin, da die Bcher der Calimala-Zunft erst 1207 begonnen wren, und da Strozzi an anderer Stelle eine nachweislich flasche, dem Vasari nachgeschiebene Behauptungaus derselben, also zweifelhaften, Quelle entnommen haben wolle (Loggia deLanzi, 1885, 64; Vasari I, 1911, 328, 329, 578). Ich halte Freys Einwendungen nicht fr stichhaltig. Auch wenn die Bcher der Calimala-Zunft erst 1207 begonnen wurden, mag man in sie Erinnerungen an kurz vorher vorgefallene Ereignisse eingetragen haben; und Strozzi kann sehr wohl die knappen Angaben der Baubcher durch Tatsachen illustriert haben, die ihm aus Vasari gelufig waren; erst er , nicht seine Vorlage, hat offenbar die irrige Kompilation vorgenommen. Sttzen kann man das Datum 1202 auch von anderer Seite her; ein Jahr spter wurde dem Baptisteriumeine hochbedeutende Reliquie geschenkt, der Arm des Apostels Philippus (Lumachi, Mem. stor. 1782, 45ff.); sollte der Umbau der Apsis schon damis in Zusammenahng gestanden haben? - Ich halte also das Datum 1202 fr zuverlssig und finde es auch durch den Stil der Inkrustation und der Bauskulpturen an der Scarsella, sowie durch das Angansdatum der Mosaiken, 1225, besttigt (vgl. auch Swarzenki, Rep. f. Kw. XXIX, 1906, 521; und Swoboda, BAptisterium, 1918, 21). Die Apsis ist 1202 freilich nicht entstanden, sondern sie wurde verndert. Sie hatte bis dahin einen halbkreisfrmigen Grundri, wie die Ausgrabungen erwiesen haben (vgl. den Bericht bei Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, 52, 53, 62, tavola IV); durch die Auffindung dieser Fundamente wird Hbschs Vermutung, die Scarsella sei keine sptere Zufgung, zum Teil besttigt (Die altchristlichen Kichen etc. 1862, Spalte 42). Supino nimmt irrtmlichan, die halbrunde Apsis gehre zum ersten, langobardischen Bau, die Scarsella aber zum Bau des 11. Jahrhunderts. Das wird widerlegt von der durch denselben Autor gemachten Beobachtung, da die runde Apsis in Verband mit dem inneren, erst dem 11. Jahrhundert angehrenden Mauerring der Fundamente steht.  Richtige Datierung bei Poggi (Riv. dA. VII, 1910, 77). Swoboda nahm einleuchtend an, man habe die runde Apsis ins Eck bertragen, weil man gewlbte Flchen schwer habe inkrustieren knnen (BAptisterium, 1918, 69); vgl. auch die irrigen Hypthesen Rupps (INkrustationsstil, 1912, 52, 53) und Salmis (Arch, rom. 35).  Von der Erbauung der Scarsella ist die von den lteren Autoren damis verknpfte angebliche Einbrechung der drei Portale abzutrennen. Eine solche Manahme hat nie stattgefunden. die Portale gehren dem ursprglichen Bauplan an (vgl. Baubeschreibung und Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 142/43; vgl. auch Anm. 61).  Davidsohn entnahm willkrlich aus Dokumenten des 14. und 15. Jahrhunderts, da man bei ERbauung der Scarsella im Osten ein neues Atrium angelegt habe; der Wortlaut der von ihm angefhrten Stellen beweist, da es sich um den Domplatz handelte (Forschungen z. G. Florenz IV, 1908, 461). - In der Zeit der Erbauung der Scarsella ist das Vorhandensein der Opera di S. Giovanni unter Leitung eines Operaio Arduinus bezeugt; anscheinend hatte die Calimala-Zunft diese Opera schon 1157 sptestens unter ihren Schutz genommen; mglicherweise handelte es sich dabei um eine Manahme der Regierung zur Sicherung der Erhaltung des gerade von ihr fertiggestellen Bauwerks; vgl. ber diese Fragen: Frey, Loggia deLanzi, 1885, 133; Geschichte von Florenz I, 1896, 737; Forschungen z. G. Glorenz I, 1896, 145, 146; Cocchi, Chiese, 1903, 40; Poggi, Riv. dA. VII, 1910, 78, 83ff.; Frey-Vasari I, 1911, 328; Salmi, Arte XVII, 1914, 275; Lami, Mon, II, 1758, 1449. (20) 1207 ist der Fuboden von S. Miniato datiert, der &amp;amp;118 derselben Zeit und Werkstatt stammen mu wie der Zodiakus und zugehrige Teile im Fuboden von S. Giovanni; vgl. Swoboda, Baptisterium, 1918, 16f.  Richa bemerkt flschlich, um 1200 sei am Fuboden gearbeitet worden; damals habe man den Zodiakus umgelegt, der vor 1048 entstanden sei (V, 1757, XXIVf.). Vgl. auch Lumachi, Mem. stor. 1782, 26f. (21) Genaueres unter Ausstattung. Ober die Opera und ihre Leiter in dieaer Epoche vgl. Frey, Loggia deLanzi, 1885, 64, 65. -Im Jahre 128 sollen die Ghibellinen beabsichtigt haben, das Baptisterium b6awillig su sent6ffD; vgl. Giovanni Villani, lib.

Abbildung des ausgegrabenen Pflasters bei Galli, Riv. dA. IX, 1916/18, 90. (23) Giovanni Villani berichtet im Buch III, Kapitel 3 seiner Chronik ber diese Manahme folgendernmaen: nel detto tempo si feciono intorno a S. Giovanni i pilastri dei gheroni del marmo per larte di Calimala, che prima erano di macigno. Gheroni (= Sporen) sind die dreieckigen Felder des Pyramidendaches, wie Nardini gezeigt hat und wie es der Wortgebrauch der Dokummente ber die Dachrestaurierungen des 14. und 15. Jahrhunderts unwiderleglich besttigt (vgl. Nardini, A e st. VII, 1888, 131 132; vgl. Baugeschichte weiter unten). I pilastri dei gheroni sind also die Pfeiler an den Ecken, die die Dachdreiecke sttzen. Alle anderen Deutungen sind falsch (vgl. etwa Bocchi-Cinelli, 1677, 27). Vasari deutete den Wortlaut Villanis irrtmlich dahin, da damals die gesamten Auenwnde inkrustiert worden seien, und diese Meinung wirkt bis auf unsere Tag nach (Vasari I, 285f.; Dei Migliore, 1684, 65, 89; Foll.-Rastr. III, 1794, 9; Del Rosso, Ricerche, 1820, 50; Hbsch, Die altchristlichen Kirchen etc. 1862, Spalte 42; Gruyer, Les oeuvres dart de la Renaissance italienne au Temple de St. Jean, 1875, 25, 26; Geschichte von Florenz I, 1896, 737.  Dagegen vgl. Fantozzi, Guida, 1842, 356; Cavallucci, A. e st. VII, 1888, 9/10; Nardini, S. Giovanni, 1902, 26 ff., 30 ff.; Frey-Vasari I, 1911, 580, etc. etc.). Vasari schrieb die Inkrustierungsarbeiten dem Arnolfo di Cambio zu, und diese Attribution wird durch die Tatsache gesttzt, da Arnolfo in den strittigen Jahren Dombaumeister war, also wohl auch die Opera des dem Domkapitel gehrenden Baptisteriums leitete (Fey, Loggia, 1885, 69; Frey-Vasari I, 1911, 575; anscheinend dem widersprechend die uerung in Thieme-Becker II, 1908, 138). Fr Arnolfos Urherberschaft spricht auch der pisanische Schichtencharackter der Inkrustation, der dann fr die Pfeiler der arnolfianischen Domfassade charakteristisch werden sollte (dagegen uerte sich Nardini, Il Campanile die S. Maria del Fiore, 52f.).  Unsicher ist die Zeitstellung dieser Arbeiten. Villani nennt das Jahr 1293. Aber Frey weist berzeugund darauf hin, da man die Pfeiler kaum vor der Beseitigung der Grber in Angriff genommen haben knne, d. h. nicht vor 1296 (Vasari I, 1911, 575). ber die Beseitigung der Grabmonumente vgl. Verlorene Ausstattung.  Sicher falsch ist die lange geglaubte Vermutung, Arnolfo habe einen ursprglich vorhandenen, dann versunkenen Stufensockel unter dem Gebude durch ein einfaches Profil erstzt (Del Migliore, 1684, 89). Die Ausgrabungen haben klar erwiesen, da ein solcher Stufensockel nie vorhanden war. Vgl. die Tafel IV bei Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, und Rekonstruktion. Das Sockelgesims scheint aber von Arnolfo erneuert worden zu sein. (24) Giovanni Villani, lib. XII, cap. XLVI. Spogli Strozziani aus den Baurechnungen der Calimala-Zunft: Nardini, A. e st.

II, 1903, 189 Name Misericordia Vecchia (1). Oratorio della Misericordia Vecchia e Capitani del Bigallo (2) Oratorio del Bigallo; commonly, Bigallo (3). See note under Building History (around 1425). Building History Oratorio of the Bigallo (Corner of Via dei Calzaiuoli and Piazza di San Giovanni) (4). The company of the Misericordia, a confraternity, acquired the building in 1321 (5). After they acquired the property through a donation of the adjoining plots in 1351, (6) they began construction of the building in 1352, which contained a loggia, an oratory, meeting hall, and a living room for the brothers of the confraternity (7). By 1358 the building process was completed (8). The design can be, in all likelihood, attributed to the architect Alberto Arnoldi, who also provided the most important three-dimensional fixtures (9). In 1425, under the oversight of Cosimo deMedici, the brotherhood of the Compagnia della Misericordia united with the original long-time resident of the building, the brotherhood of Santa Maria del Bigallo, jointly receiving the residence of the latter through a co-ownership agreement (10). Constructional changes were apparently not undertaken at that time. A fire in 1442 damaged the upper floor of the building (11). In 1452 the Sala dellUdienza was expanded through the inclusion of a new room (12). Since the 1700s multiple disfiguring changes to the building were undertaken. In 1698 the arcade of the loggia and the window in the upper floor were walled up (13). After termination of the Bigallos management in 1776, the building was given as the site of the administration for the state orphanage and was altered significantly from its original configuration during the restoration (14). Walls were removed from the arcade of the loggia in 1865 and the interior of the oratory was restored then (15). In 1882 the walled-up windows on the upper floors were re-opened (16), and a final restoration took pace in 1904 (17). Building Description Old Descriptions.  The fresco of Niccol di Pietro Gerini, Restitution of Children, Sala de Consiglio  The predella of Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio, high altar. In the Bigallo itself (see building facilities)  Codex of Macro di Bartolommeo Rustici, mid 15th-century (Photo under the authority [soprintendenza] 7646)  Cityscape by Stefano Bonsignori, 1584  Illustrations by Mori-Boffito, Piante e Vedute di Firenze, 1926  Drawing by E. Burci (before 1865)  Exterior view of now walled-up loggia and the same windows  Illustrations in Rivista dArte II, 1904, p. 244 Building Images.  Elevation engraving from D. Callesi in Rohault de Fleury, Le Toscane au Moyenage, 1876 Exterior The building abuts the neighboring houses to the south and west. Its northern faade included three niches, with one on the eastern wall. These and the eastern niche of the northern area were designed as a square loggia, which served as exhibition space for foundlings. The two round-arched openings of the porch were framed through two-story pilaster pairs and a cornice; a corresponding system of two-story pilasters and rounded arches were superimposed on two remaining bays in the north wall (18). Each of the bays was articulated with a pointed arch with broad architraves and striated frames; the last bay contained an arched window (19). Above the ground floor pilasters articulate a mezzanine floor, in which naturalistic and picturesque decorations appear. Also, the floor above is articulated by pilasters: on the north wall appear three boxes, one on the east wall; every one of these boxes contains a round arch combined with a bifurcated window. On the pilasters, the springing level of the windows are connected by a shelf and sit carved with volutes furnished by girders which protrude out and are supported by rafters. The Loggia By Alberto Arnoldi (see building history). A highlight of the lavish decorative style, Andrea Orcagnas famous tabernacle in Orsanmichele would have been well known. Alberto Arnoldi, like Orcagna a sculptor-architect, had incorporated Orcagnas style during the buildings development. The pillars stand on plinths made of marble slabs, which contain vivid, grooved quatrefoils; in each of the arcades openings stands another square marble slab with a rose window of individual work. The outer pilaster pairs are also adorned with quatrefoils; on the inner pillars and the arches the quatrefoils are somewhat bigger and contain half-length figures (see facilities). In the embrasures of the arcade are rotated, ornamental foliate pillars, which continue in the archivolt as a rotated bead molding. The flat pilasters against the arches are ornamented with molding strips; on their starting points appear flat corbels with leaf work (20). The interior of the logger is simpler. The numerous bases run along the thin shelf, where there are also continuous pilasters. Between these are located wide niches, in which are lintels with decorated, screened pointed arches and quatrefoils. The niches are closed with rounded arches; between these arches and the pointed arched ribbed vaults emerge spandrels from each ornamental circle. Interior The oratory belonged to a rare type of large, arched, gothic churches, among them San Jacopo in Campo Corbolini, San Martino della Scala, and San Carlo Borromeo I. There were two pointed, overlaid, ribbed arches, supported by broad and flat, splayed corner panels that compose pilasters. The rose windows in the north wall were extended in 1865 at the same time that the arcade of the loggia had windows installed inside it. Facilities Exterior The entrance hall contains the three-dimensional decorations that were designed by the architect Alberto Arnoldi, who was also a sculptor. These are presented as preserved gems of gothic building decoration, a rarity in Trecento Florence. The execution is often rough, as there were obviously assistants involved in their production. The end products were clearly based on an antiquated taste that derived from gothic prototypes, but were also independent of those traditional forms. Entrance Hall In the quatrefoil of the inner pilaster pairs and the arches of the half-figures; eight prophets appear on the east side. In the vortex of the arcade we see the Man of Sorrows; on the north side are eight angels and the Savior. In the gusset of the arcade appear the four Cardinal Virtues, with Justice and Prudence placed on the north side and Wisdom and Temperance on the east side (21). Assistants produced four pairs of masks with attached leaves that were placed in the niches and the embrasures on the interior of the loggia, close over the cornices. Upper Floors on the North Side Over the loggia stand half life-sized figures produced by a Florentine sculptor in the second half of the 14th century: These stone sculptures represent the Madonna with Child, Saint Peter Martyr and Saint Lucy; (22). The three baldicchini from 1413 have been attributed to Filippo di Cristofano (23). Between these canopies appear frescoes of worshipping angels, probably produced around 1425 (25). In the middle bay sits a bust of the Madonna with Child by Alberto Arnoldi from 1361. Over the blind arcade on either side of the bays appear frescoes depicting Peter Martyr Presenting Banners to Twelve Followers of the Company of the Misericordia and The Miracles by the Preaching of Peter Martyr painted by Ventura di Moro and Russell di Jacopo Franchi in 1445/6; these were very badly destroyed during Gaetano Bianchis restoration in 1882 (26). The remaining paint  including the ornaments and the figures in quatrefoils  all came from the restoration of the 19th century. Interior Oratory High altar: A carved tabernacle bears three niches, with the middle ornamentally flanked with two pillars and crowned by a spread architrave and round gables designed and executed by Nofero dAntonio Noferi (1515) and gilded by Bernardo di Jacopo and Zanobi di Lorenzo (27). The three marble statues by Alberto Arnoldi feature the Madonna with Child and two candlestickholding angels, all produced between 1359 and 1364 (28). The painted predella by Rodolfo del Ghirlandaio from 1515 contains five pictures: the Death of Saint Peter Martyr, the Birth of Christ, the Cloaked Misericordia, the Flight into Egypt, and the Burial of Tobit (Two Men Carrying a Body, with the Bigallo depicted in the background); (29). In the stained glass in the rose windows of the north wall appears the figure of Caritas, or Charity, from around 1865 (30). Sala del Consiglio (entrance at 1 Piazza di San Giovanni) Wooden door.

On further lost equipment, materials, and facilities, which are no longer in the established locations today, see the documents by Poggi, Rivista dArte II, 1904. Notes (1) As the building was named, before the Company of the Bigallo received joint ownership in 1425. (2) Del Migliore, 1684 (3) Richa VII, 1785, 251. The name Bigallo is alleged to have derived from a hospital of this name by Ruballa (spedale di S. Maria a Fonteviva, named del Bigallo), that the Compagnia Maggiora della Vergine knew and then transferred from their residence; see Richa VII, 1758; research on G. Florenze IV, 1908, 426 and History of Florence II, 1908. (4) The History of the Compagnia della Misericordia is often falsely described, where they are confused with the Compagnia del Bigallo, which existed separately until 1425. The Compagnia della Misericordia was first mentioned in documents around 1321 (see the following notes). According to the Liber Chronicorum by Saint Anthony (ed. Giunti 1486, Vol III, Part III, Chapter VII, p. 233) this confraternity would have arisen out of the 1292 founding of the Laudese Brotherhood from Orsanmichele; see Passerini, Stab., 1853, 446f., but this is an erroneous assumption, as the company was first mentioned in 1329. Other legendary founding stories are mentioned in the Illustrated Florence, 1847, 49ff. and by Passerini, Stab., 1853, 440 ff.. (5) Poggi, Riv. dA. II, 1904, 194 note, after the Spogli Strozzi. Richa VII, 1758, 268 dated the donation of property by the early Baldinuccio Adimari, describing the houses from around 1340. (6) Document from 9.16.1351 by Poggi, Riv. dA. II, 1904, 225/6; see also Passerini, Notes., 1853, 448. (7) Document from 1.28.1352 (building beginning) by Poggi, Riv. dA. II, 1904, 226; unknown by Passerini, Note., 1853, 449/450. (8) By this year, the grids of the loggia had already been manufactured; Document by Poggi, Riv. dA. II, 1904, 226. (9) Vasari I, 302 named Nicola Pisano as the architect; he followed Landini, Bigallo, 1779, XIII. In contrast, Passerini (1853, 449-450) referred to chronological contradictions and argued that Andrea Orcagna was the architect. Burckhardt, Cicerone, 1860, 145 ascribed it to followers of Orcagna. Frey, Loggia deLanzi, 1885, 105 argued against the possibility that Orcagna would have been an influence to the architect of the Bigallo (Tabernacle in Orsanmichele). Frey also thought older components from the building could have been withdrawn; the structures of both western arcades and pilasters reminded him of the similar building styles seen in Santa Maria Novella and Santa Croce, and so he came to the conclusion that the rest of the old oratorio could have been constructed by Arnolfo di Cambio, the architect responsible for Santa Croce (Frey, ibid., 86, 105). In Contrast, Poggi, Riv. dA. II, 1904, 193/4 believed that the Brotherhood may well have resided in this location as early as 1321 (see Note 5) and that furthermore the construction planning allowed for no elimination of older parts. However, Poggi supported the first of Freys opinions, that Alberto Arnoldi had been the builder. Venturi, Storia IV, 1906, 684 attributed the building to Arnoldi, under the influence of Orcagna; Thieme-Becker I, 1907, 218 concurred that Arnoldi was the architect of the Bigallos loggia, as did L. Beccherucci, Arte XXX 1927, 214. (10) Del Migliore, 1684, 78; Richa VII, 1758, 267/268 after a writing for the 1700s; Illustrated Florence IV, 1839, 32; Passerini, Stab., 1853, 797; Poggi, Riv. dA II, 1904, 192, 195. Further research in G. Florenz IV, 1908, 427 wrongly dated to 1452. (11) Poggi, Riv. dA. II, 1904, 197. (12) Documents by Poggi, Riv. DA. II, 296. (13) Poggi, Riv. dA. II, 1904, 201 after a contemporary diary. This condition is described by Landini, Bigallo, 1779, XIV and reproduced in a drawing of E. Burci, illustrated by Poggi, ibid., 244. (14) Poggi, Riv. dA II, 1904, 202. (15) Passerini, cur. stor. art. 91; Poggi, Riv. dA. II, 1904, 202; the works were managed by Mariano Falcini. (16) Poggi, Riv. dA. II, 1904, 202. (17) Poggi, Riv. dA. II, 1904, 202; A. e. st. XXIII, 1904, 155. (18) As a precursor to these systems see San Giovannino dei Cavalieri. (19) The windows were expanded in 1865; see Poggi, Riv. dA II, 1904, 196. (20) It is uncertain if the figures should stand there. (21) The three dimensional decoration were attributed first by Frey, Loggia deLanzi, 1885, 105 to Alberto Aroldi; Poggi, Riv. dA II, 1904, 193, presumed  with justification  that assistants also participated. See also M. Raymond, Gaz. B. A. II, 1893, 322 and Le sculpture florentine, 1897, I, 170f; Venturi, Storia IV, 1906, 684; Thieme-Becker I, 1907, 218. (22) The three statues originate from the old oratory of the Brotherhood of the Bigallo (see Bigallo II) and were transferred there in 1425. They were painted by Ambrogio di Baldese in 1392, see Poggi, Riv. dA II, 1904, 230/231 (Documents) and 192/193  the attribution to Nicola Pisano stems from Vasari I, 302 and Landini, Bigallo, 1779, XIII: Milanesi-Vasari I, 302 corrected mistakes about the statues by producing documentation that mentioned them as the works of Filippo di Cristofano (1413); see also Swarzenski, Kunstgeschichte Anz.

IX, 1839, 45 read the date as 1352, so one must assume, this date was probably distorted through a restoration; see Passerini, Stab., 1853, 450ff. and Poggi, Riv. DA. II, 1904, 203ff.

The representation of the Bigallo on the fresco of Niccol di Pietro Gerini and Ambrogio di Baldese (now in the Sala del Consiglio) and on the Predella of the high altar by Rid. Del Ghirlandaio unanimously reproduce the grid as a simple network of crossed iron rods. It was cut into rectangular doors; in the arches, the network rested on a crossbeam. (37) Document by Poggi, Riv. dA. II, 1904, 229. (38) The position of this fresco is not determined exactly; Del Migliore 1684, 80 saw it, sopra al portone del Ricetto, Richa VII, 1758, 293 simply says sopra al portone; most likely one could expect it on the now-free side that faces them campanile. Admittedly Poggi assumed (see the next note) the lost third Peter Martyr fresco, the origins of which we can not necessarily be certain, was also constructed there. Further literature in Note 32. (39) Outside of the two preserved frescos of this painter (see under Facilities) a third is named in a document (see Poggi, Riv. dA. II, 1904, 241); Poggi speculates that the lost fresco was located over the arcade on the east side. The document continues further, though not necessarily reliably, that this third fresco was completed. (40) Document, payment to Pietro Chellini 1443/44, by Rumohr, Ital. Forsch.

Baugeschichte Die Compagnia della Misericordia, eine mildttige Bruderschaft (4), erwarb 1321 ein Haus an der Sdseite der Piazza del Duomo, dem Portal des Baptisteriums gegenber (5). Nachdem ihr Besitz durch die Schenkung des angrenzenden Grundstckes (an der Ecke der Via deCalzaiuoli) im Jahre 1351 vergrert worden war (6), begann man 1352 mit der Errichtung eines Baues, der eine Loggia, ein Oratorium, Versammlungs- und Wohnrume fr die Mitglieder der Bruderschaft enthalten sollte (7). 1358 war der Bau bereits vollendet (8). Als Architekt kann mit groer Wahrscheinlichkeit Alberto Arnoldi bezeichnet werden, der auch die wichtigsten Teile der plastischen Ausstattung lieferte (9). Im Jahre 1425 wurde auf Veranlassung Cosimos de Medici die ursprnglich an anderer Stelle ansssige Bruderschaft von S. Maria del Bigallo mit der Compagnia della Misericordia vereinigt, indem sie zugleich die Residenz der letzteren zum Mitbesitz erhielt (10). Bauliche Vernderungen wurden damals offenbar nicht vorgenommen. - Ein Brand im Jahre 1442 beschdigte nur das obere Stockwerk des Gebudes (11). 1452 wurde die Udienza durch Einbeziehung eines neuen Raumes erweitert (12). Seit dem 17. Jahrhundert wurden mehrfach entstellende Vernderungen am Bau vorgenommen. 1698 wurden die Arkaden der Loggia und die Fenster im Obergescho vermauert (13). Nach der Auflsung der Bigallo-Behrde im Jahre 1776 diente das Gebude als Sitz der Verwaltung eines staatlichen Waisenhauses und wurde aus diesem Anla verstndnislos restauriert (14). 1865 entfernte man die Mauern aus den Arkaden der Loggia und restaurierte das Innere des Oratoriums (15). 1882 wurden dann auch die vermauerten Fenster des Obergeschosses wieder geffnet (16) ; eine letzte Restaurierung fand 1904 statt (17). Baubeschreibung Alte Darstellungen: auf dem Fresko des Niccol di Pietro Gerini, Rckgabe verlorener Kinder, Sala del Consiglio; auf der Predella des Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio, Hochaltar; beides im Bigallo selbst (vgl. unter Ausstattung). - Kodex des Marco di Bartolommeo Rustichi, Mitte 15.

Cellesi in Rohault de Fleury, La Toscane au Moyenage, 1876. Auen Das Gebude lehnt sich nach Sden und Westen an die Nachbarhuser an. Seine Nordfassade umfat drei Wandfelder, die stliche eines. Dieses und das stliche Feld der Nordseite sind zu einer quadratischen Loggia ausgestaltet, die als Ausstellungsraum fr Findelkinder diente. Die zwei rundbogigen ffnungen dieser Vorhalle werden durch zweigeschossige Pilasterpaare und ein Gesims gerahmt; ein entsprchendes System, zweigeschossige Pilaster und Rundbgen, ist den zwei restlichen Jochen der Nordwand vorgeblendet (18). Von diesen beiden Jochen enthlt das an die Loggia anschlieende ein Spitzbogenportal mit breitem Architrav und gequaderter Rahmung; das letzte Joch enthlt ein Rundbogenfenster (19). ber dem Erdgescho folgt ein nur von Pilastern gegliedertes Zwischengescho, das dem plastischen und malerischen Schmuck vorbehalten blieb. Auch das Obergescho ist durch Pilaster gegliedert: an der Nordwand hat es drei Felder, an der Ostwand eines; jedes dieser Felder enthlt en durch einen Rundbogen zusammengefates Biforienfenster. Auf den Pilastern, die in Kmpferhhe der Fenster durch ein Gesims verbunden sind, sitzen reich geschnitzte, mit Voluten versehene Tragbalken auf, die das weitvorstehende Sparrendach sttzen, Die Loggia. Von Alberto Arnoldi (vgl. unter Baugeschichte). Ein Glanzstck des ppigen dekorativen Stils, den Andrea Orcagna an seinem berhmten Tabernakel in Or San Michele ausgebildet hatte. Alberto Arnoldi, gleich Orcagna ein Bildhauer-Baumeister, hat Orcagnas Stil noch whrend dessen Entstehung aufgenommen.  Die Pfeiler erheben sich auf einer Sockelbank, deren Marmorplatten lebhaft profilierte Vierpsse enthalten; in den Arkadenffnung folgt noch je eine etwa quadratische Marmorplatte mit einer Rosette in durchbrochener Arbeit. Mit Vierpssen sind auch die ueren Pilasterpaare geschmckt; an den inneren Pilastern und den Bgen sind die Vierpsse etwa grer und enthalten Halbfiguren (vgl. Ausstattung).  in der Laibung der Arkaden stehen gedrehte, mit Laubwerk ornamentierte Sulen, die sich in der Archivolte als gedrehter Rundstab fortsetzen.  Die flachen Pilaster neben den Bgen sind mit Profilbndern ornamentiert; an ihren Ansatzpunkten befinden sich flache Konsolen mit Laubwerk (20). Das Innere der Loggia ist schlichter; in Hhe der Sockelbank verluft ein feines Gesims, das sich auch ber die Wandpfeiler hinzieht. Zwischen diesen befinden sich breite Nischen, deren Laibungen mit Spitzbogenblenden geschlossen; der zwischen diesen Bgen und dem spitzbogigen Kreuzrippengewlbe entstehende Zwickel ist mit je einem ornamentalen Kreit gefllt. Innen. Das Oratorium gehrt zum seltenen Typus der gewlbten gotischen Saalkirchen; vgl. S. Jacopo in Campo Corboloni (1311 ff.), S. Martino della Scala (1317 ff.) und S. Carlo Borromeo I (1342ff.). Es wird von zwei spitzbogigen Kreuzrippengewlben berdeckt, die auf breiten und flachen, von abgekanteten Ecksulen begleiteten Pilastern auflagern. Das Rundfenster in der Nordwand wurde 1865 erweitert; gleichzeitig wure die Arkade zur Loggia hin verglast. Ausstattung Auen Allgemeines. Die plastiche Dekoratin konzentriert sich auf die Vorhalle, die von dem Baumesiter Alberto Arnoldi, selbst einem Bildhauer, zu einem wahren Glanzstck gotischer Baudekoration ausgestaltet wurde, wie es im florentinischen Trecento nicht viele gibt (1352-58, vgl. Baugeschichte). Die Ausfhrung ist oft etwas derb, gewi waren Gehilfenhnde beteiligt. Die sehr bedeutende Erfindung aber beruht auf einem im Grunde antikischen Geschmack der aus einem gotischen Programm und berkommenen gotischen Formen etwas Selbstndiges zu gestalten wute. Vorhalle. In den Vierpssen der inneren Pilasterpaare und der Bgen Halbfiguren; an der Ostseite acht Propheten, im Scheitel der Arkade der Schmerzensmann; an der Nordseite acht Engel und der Salvator. - In den Zwickeln der Arkaden: die vier Kardinaltugenden; an der Nordseite Gerechtigkeit und Tapferkeit, an der Ostseite Klugheit und Migung (21). Im Innern der Loggia sind an den Laibungen der Nischen, dicht ber dem Gesims, vier Paare von Masken mit Blattwerk angebracht, offenbar von anderer Hand als die brige Bauplastik. Obergescho an der Nordseite. ber der Loggia halblebensgroe Steinfiguren, Madonna mit Kind, die Hlg. Petrus Martyr und Lucia; florentinisch, 2. Hlfte 14. Jahrhundert (22). Die drei Baldachine 1413 von Filippo di Cristofano hinzugefgt (23). - Zwischen den Baldachinen Fresken, anbetende Engel, um 1425 {24). - Im mittleren Joch Halbfigur der Madonna mit Kind von Alberto Arnoldi, 1361 (25). - ber den Blendarkaden der beiden westlichen Joche Fresken, Petrus Martyr berreicht Standarten an zwlf Mitglieder der Compagnia della Misericordia; Wunder bei der Predigt des Petrus Martyr; von Ventura di Moro und Rossello di Jacopo Franchi, 1445/46; sehr zerstrt und 1882 von Gaetano Bianchi restauriert (26).

(3) Richa VII, 1758, 251. - Der Name Bigallo ist angeblich von einem Hospital dieses Namens bei Ruballa (spedale di S. Maria a Fonteviva, genannt del Bigallo), das der Compagnia Maggiore della Vergine gehrte, zunchst auf diese und dann auf ihre Residenz bertragen worden; vgl. Richa VII, 1758, 255; Forschungen z. G. Florenz IV, 1908, 426ff. und Geschichte von Florenz II, 1908, 294ff. (4) Die Geschichte der Compagnia della Misericordia ist oft falsch dargestellt worden, da man sie mit der - bis 1425 gesondert existierenden - Compagnia del Bigallo verwechselte. Die Compagnia della Misericordia wird erst 1321 urkundlich erwhnt (vgl. die folgende Anm.). Nach dem Liber Chronicorum des hlg. Antonin (ed. Giunti 1586, T. III, Parte III, Cap. VII, P 233) wre sie aus der 1292 gegrndeten Laudesi-Bruderschaft von Or San Michele hervorgegangen; vgl. Passerini, Stab., 1853, 446f., der irrtmlich annahm, die Compagnia werde erst 1329 zuerst erwhnt. - Andere, legendre Grndungsgeschichten im Ill. fior. 1847, 49 ff. und bei Passerini, Stab., 1853, 440ff. erwhnt.

(9) Vasari I, 302 nennt als Erbauer Niccol Pisano; ihm folgte Landini, Bigallo, 1779, XIII. Dagegen wandte sich Passerini, Stab., 1853, 449-450 mit dem Hinweis auf den chronologischen Widerspruch; er glaubte, Andrea Orcagna sei der Architekt. Burckhardt, Cicerone, 1860, 145 dachte an einen Nachfolger des Orcagna. Frey, Loggia deLanzi, 1885, 105 erwog umgekehrt die Mlglichkeit, da Orcagna von der Architektur des Bigallo beeinflut worden sei (Tabernakel in Or San Michele). Frey glaubte auch, ltere Bestandteile aus dem Bau ausscheiden zu knnen; die Gliederung der beiden westlichen Arkaden und Pilaster erinnerte ihn an hnliche Bauteile in S. Maria Novella und S. Croce, und so kam er zu der Vermutung, dies seien Reste eines alten Oratoriums, das vielleicht von Arnolfo di Cambio erbaut worden sei (Frey a. a. 0. 86, 105). Dagegen wandte Poggi, Riv. dA. II, 1904, 193/194 mit Recht ein, da die Bruderschaft sich erst 1321 an dieser Stelle niedergelassen habe (vgl. Anm. 5), und da auerdem der Baufund keine Ausscheidung lterer Teile zulasse. Auch Poggi vertritt die zuerst von Frey vorgetragene Ansicht, da Alberto Arnoldi der Erbauer sei. - Venturi, Storia IV, 1906, 684: von Arnoldi unter dem Einflu Orcagnas; Thieme-Becker I, 1907, 218: ebenso.

Presumably it is a popular variation of the name of the previously located church, Saint Michael in Orto, of which it is said, that this church lay in gardens; this name was officially recorded in 1239 (1) . Another meaning can be found in the accompanying word Or, a reference to the granary (Latin horreum), that replaced the older church (2), yet this conjecture is refuted by the appearance of the word Orto in 1239, so before the foundation of the granary. Building History A small convent with a church named S. Michaelis in Orto was situated on the site of Orsanmichele; it was designated in 895 as a long-standing endowment of Abbot Peter of S. Silvestro in Nonantola (3) and was established perhaps soon after the foundation of the mother monastery (752), as it was consecrated with the cult of the Lombard national saint (4). The convent remained in the possession of the famous northern Italian Abbot as long as it existed (5). It appears to have had a certain significance in Florentine cultural life during the 9th century (6). In 1046 S. Michele in Orto operated under the administration of a provost (7); The convent possibly no longer existed. In the year 1239 the church was apparently destroyed in a family feud, namely through the fault of Mundaldus Ranutius and other Florentine citizens (8). The city administration seized the new space in the middle of the city in order to renovate a public square (9). A few decades later, in February 1285, they allowed, in that very space, an open hall for the grain market to be put on (10). This building is supposed to have been constructed by Arnolfo di Cambio (11) and was already in use (12). On one of its columns, a Madonna image had been mounted. In 1292 this began to heal a plague in a miraculous way; since then the hall became one of the most important places of worship/cult sites of the city and the seat of a powerful confraternity, that organized regular hymns in honor of the portrait of mercy, and therefore was named Laudesi (13). Still, the hall also served through its original secular purpose for a few more decades. In the year 1304, it fell victim, with its whole district, to fire which Ser Neri Abati hat created in the course of a family feud (14). In 1307 they began the construction of the replacement (15). Still unfinished in 1308, this second hall appeared to be not very solidly advised (16). Already in 1321 it threatened to collapse and needed to be repaired (17). The same repeated once again in 1332 (18). Potentially the flood of 1333, during which the water stood two cubits high in the hall (19), accelerated the deterioration of the building once again. In any case, in 1336 the government found in due form, that the hall, because of its small size, could not preserve the volume of stored grain well, and furthermore the hall downright constituted an eyesore in the cityscape; it probably should, as they determined, develop a new hall in its place, and a more proper palace to be sure, big enough to store the grain better and to provide the cult of the miraculous Madonna image a worthy setting, beautiful enough to do honor to the city; at once a commission was started in order to put the new building into operation (20). On July 29th of the following year ceremonial laying of the foundation stone took place in the presence of all of the public authorities; it was determined at once, that over the yet to be created mercy-painting Oratorium, two floors with arched ceilings would be built as granaries, and two years later, that the guilds (as contributors to the city government) would have put up their patron saints on the new palace, in such a way that each column of the hall would be adorned with a saint (21). That magnificent landmark of the Florentine community, that arose here in the decades of work after that and always is admired as one of the most perfect monuments of Florentine Gothic and Renaissance, had already been planned with full awareness of its complete scope. Who provided the design for the new building and thereby initiated a new age in the development of the Florentine Gothic, is unknown. The painter Taddeo Gaddi, to whom Vasari attributes this merit, comes into consideration (22), not Andrea Orcagna (23). Futhermore, Neri di Fioravanti, Benci di Cione, and before all Francesco Talenti, whose later buildings and school of buildings, the cathedral and the Loggia deLanzi, yield a logical development of style from Orsanmichele, come into question (24). The building owner was as representative of the city government guild of the silk weavers (25). The structure must have been funded rather quickly in the first year. Already beginning in 1339, parts of more than ten columns stood, and the rest should have followed immediately (26).  In the fall of that year and in the year 1342, the government allocated additional funds for the building (27). In 1343 it founded a St. Anne Cult dedicated to Orsanmichele in order to hold the day of the eviction of the Duke of Athens in solemn memory. At the time one apparently decided, to whom to give the begun market hall floor of the new structure the character of a church to the greatest extent (28). Soon after, the work appears to have become gradually slower and finally came to a halt during the plague of 1348. The columns stand finished, adorned with their frescos, the scaffolding for the vault was constructed, and if the money to complete the building isnt approved, all that has been completed will of necessity deteriorate, told vividly and imploringly by the silk guild on 19. April 1350 as they sought the support of the city government (29). It must have really stimulated the operation again. Shortly thereafter, the order of an expensive tabernacle for the miracle-working Madonna image was made; it indicates, that they surely reckoned with an early completion of the church, and already in April 1357 the vault appeared to be finished (30). Around the same time (1361), the government transferred the grain market away from the Piazza di Orsanmichele, in order to ensure a dignified surrounding for the nearly finished Tabernacle (31). In doing so, a broader, more significant step in the gradual conquest of the building for the cult was done. The complete obliteration of all traces of the originally intended, secular purpose was decided in 1366, while the construction of the upper, also to the grain-storage-intended rooms under the direction of Benci di Cione proceeded slowly (32). At that time the superintendents agreed to lattice the arcade of the bottom floor through tracery and therefore to transform the open hall into a closed church (33). In the same year, the care of the altar service was taken from the monastic order, who dealt with it in a predetermined, regular cycle, and appointed a specially assigned a sacristan to carry out this task (34). On 2. April 1367 (after the others on 11. April 1366) two traceries were begun, and they appointed Simone di Francesco Talenti to complete these test pieces he had begun, but then was ordered to await further instructions from the building authority (35). Any talk of a continuation of work came again only in 1378 and 1380. Simone di Francesco Talenti pops up again as the senior architect; Antonio di Francesco, Giovanni di Buonafede, Leonardo Masi, Matteo di Cione, and Lorenzo di Filippo were named as executive, and apparently clumsy stone masons who were repeatedly forced to provide compensation for botched work (36). In 1380 the insertion of the tracery in the arcade was finally able to arrive, because in this year the talk is of the relocation of the windows (37).  At that time/then it was decided thus probably even already, to close the gothic tracery in the arcade with walls (38). Still, the middle opening remained open in the middle arcade of the two long sides and preserved in this  until the year 1770 (39). In 1380 the completion of the construction of the upper floors of the palace was approaching. At that time marble was acquired, probably for the State windows (40), and worked into the roof (41). The acceleration of work shortly before 1380 would like to related to, that in 1379 the Laudesi-Brotherhod delegated the construction management role to the silk guild (42). Around 1380, the church was therefore essentially as it is preserved today, but there remained some detail work to complete. In 1384 a tenth of the revenue of the brotherhood was specified for the continuation of construction; 1397 new donations (43). In 1404 the cornice of the palace was drafted (44). In 1408 and 1410, Niccol di Piero Lamberti completed the perhaps already earlier begun work on the two main doors; his stake is no only clearly defined (45). In 1415 a collegiate church was established in the church (46). Around 1480 it was temporarily secularized (47). It never suffered any serious changes. In 1569 the upper floor of the palace was configured as a state archive (48) and was connected with the opposite administrative building of the wool weavers guild through an overpass over the street, allegedly by Bernardo Bountalenti. In 1628 the right, southern main door of the faade was bricked over (49). In 1770 they were bricked over in the mean time in the lower part of the central openings in the middle arcades of both sides; Concurrently, a sacristy was installed in the left, northern, choir (50). In 1821 the tympanum under the connecting arch was removed, and in 1858 again restored (51). In 1852 ff. the decorative parts of the arcade were replaced to a large extent (52). In 1901 a new Restoration took place (53). In 1931 ff. the flooring in the two front bays of the Oratorium, that later had been raised to a higher level than the last (choir) bay, was changed back into its original condition, and the sacristy addition was removed. Reconstruction of Lost Building Elements Church and Cloister of S. Michaelis in Orto. About the Carolingian cloister building of the 8th or 9th century it is only known, that it included a workshop for wool weavers (54). The church had become small, since the convent consisted of only a few nuns (In 885 there were 6 sisters). The First Granary; 1285, by Arnolfo di Cambio (?). More delicate natural stone building with ten columns (55).  The column with the famous miraculous image (see under page 499 The Miraculous Image and Its Tabernacle) was housed in a small wooden structure already in 1294, so that the devout viewers could shelter (it) against the evening air (56). Whether a remnant of this column still exists (in the current miraculous image tabernacle) remains to be seen; to that end, see page 499 f. The Second Granary; 1308 ff. It was significantly smaller than the modern building (57) and had thin, poorly engineered brick piers (58). The miraculous image [hung] on one of the columns; whether a remnant of this column was preserved (in the current miraculous image tabernacle) remains to be seen; to this end, see page 499 f. Building Description The Basic Concept Building Record Drawings from Giorgio Vasari JD, Uffizien, Nr. 4784 und 6158-71.  Floorplan, vertical plan, cutaway drawings, details, etc. by Rohault de Fleury, La Toscane au moyenge, I, 1870, and by Mazzanti-Del Lungo, Raccolta delle migliori fabbriche etc. 1876, LXXXVI ff. (59). Type The building concept of Orsanmichele is a rarity; in it the architectural types of the market hall, the granary, and the confraternity oratory are combined into one entity, which could come about only through the concurrence of entirely special, historical circumstances (60). The ground floor  begun as a market hall  is a vaulted colonnade; it was originally open and after a change in plans was converted into a closed church interior through the walling-up of the outer arcades (61). Above rises two high upper floors erected as granaries (62). The originally intended dichotomy between the open colonnade and the above ambitious tower-house-like apartment building of the storage floors must have appeared very strange. Mechanics The whole building is from gray-yellow sandstone (Macigno); only the colonettes of the windows of the upper floors are of white marble. The mechanics of the ashlar rectangular building matured here into a technical achievement that remained unrivaled in Florence during the gothic era (63). Among other things, the stone masons, with visible pleasure at the performing mastery of their ability here, have invented ingenious mechanisms like for example that chute in the northwestern corner pier, though which the grain of the storage facility above could be poured into the market hall below very easily (63a). Exterior Only the part of the building that the church comprises  the ground floor  is described here. Floor Plan Rectangular, facing from West to East.  Structure. Its parts emerged in four different building periods based on four different plans: The Structural Framework originates from the first building phase, that wanted to propose an open market hall (1337-57). It stems from a round-arched column balustrade of massive weight (See Note 71). On the four corners stand four corner piers, between them six intermediate piers, and on the narrow sides of the building (on the west and east) each on the long side, each two. The intermediate piers are rectangular, their edges beveled. The corner piers consist of two half-columns, rectangular, slightly-longer, correspondingly formed half-columns; the two west ones are longer than the two east ones. The rounded arches over the piers have beveled edges (See Note 71). Stonework; around 1366-80 and subsequently applied in the column balustrade; principle work of Simone di Francesco Talenti  the richest stonework composition of the Florentine Trecento, opulently late gothic (64). Each single arcade is organized in the following way. In them rise two narrow pillars out of bundled together colonettes, and on the flat side of the bordering piers there are corresponding half posts. Through which three openings are divided; the middle served as the entrance originally, and the two outside ones were obstructed, and embellished through thin stone barriers with shallow relief, decorated band work (65). Above the strikingly naturalistic post-capitals, that are decorated with leaves and rose-like blossoms, the original tracery arises as filling of the large rounded arch of the arcade. From each capital to the next spans a half-circle arch; these arches cross one and other and create pointed arches through them, for each, one or the other, of the above described three openings; in each pointed arch a rounded arch, in each rounded arch, a multifoil arch. In the six spandrels, that are there, bigger and smaller rosettes are used and framed with branch work and foliage. The Fillings. Light brick walls close the three openings in each large arcade between the tracery of Simone Talenti. The two side openings have been closed since 1380, the middle since 1770 (66). The Door. The filling of the two arcades on the west side of the church is built to correspond to the filling of the other arcades (see above), probably also done according to the plan of Simone di Francesco Talenti. Yet the (somewhat broad) space contains in each here, between the two posts, a stately late-gothic ashlar entrance, seemingly designed by Niccolo di Piero Lamberti (1408/10). Above the door opening there is an architrave, and above that there is an arch, and above that the gothic ornamental gable of complicated flamboyant-late gothic form (67). System. A column hall of two aisles and three bays, bordered on the outside by the above described round colonnade and filling wall (68). In the central axis exists two free piers, square with polygonal corner elements. Corresponding with them  constructed analogously  as copies of the doublewide outer piers are four quarter-piers in the four corners, two half-piers on each long side, and one half-pier on each small side of the hall. The bays are nearly square. Above each spans a cross ribbed vault; the transverse arches are as wide as the pier sides, and flat and smooth, the ribbings of the column pilasters are correspondingly polygonal; the transverse builds semicircular arches, that the ribbings segment. Between the otherwise elongated corner piers of the entrance wall, in which there are spiral stairs which lead to the upper level, and behind the door there two niches with barrel vaults. Meaning Orsanmichele is one of the more perfect creations of the Florentine Trecento architecture and evolutionarily highly important: in this school of architecture the most important efforts of the first Gothic century of Florentine architecture were summarized and interpreted with ingenious creativity, that from the old ideas grew a new idea of beauty. The interior design was the last fulfillment of these efforts toward hall-like expanse and calm, which was triggered by the architecture school of S. Maria Novella (69). Here the purest form of the hall form was reached. The hall was almost as wide as it was long (70). The two naves were very wide and not very tall. The well-proportioned quadrangle is the base form of every single bay. From this finely tuned harmony of all these motives, there is a harmony of space. This harmony is even more apparent, in that the construction form and elements with creative fantasy that matched the bays. Apparently with well calculated intentions, in the place of the gothic pointed arch, what appears is a rounded arch, and with it, in place of a form that points beyond itself, the form remains enclosed within itself (71). Above all however, the newly built pier-type for Orsanmichele serves as the new beauty ideal. Its form can be interpreted two ways: either as rectangular with service on the beveled corners. (see above) or as cross form with corner pilasters in the corners between atrophied cross arms; in this very clear dualism there is the possibility of interpreting them as a gothic as well as a pre-gothic schemata. In any case, this possibility unites in a highly perfect and convincing way, the gothic logic of the bunded limb piers of S. Maria Novella with the Italian simplicity of the square pillars of the Arnolfini Badia (72). The pier of Orsanmichele has at the same time a clear structure that exemplifies the pier of S. Trinita, that means a high, clearly-placed base and a high capital, whose rich acanthus band rings it, also connected to the corner pier. In the surfaces of these piers, gothic arch panel and hexagons are etched, very shallow and delicately (on each of the four sides of each panel and above them a hexagon); like on the building of Arnolfo and Giotto (73). These flat ornamental shapes emphasized subtly the harmony of well-proportioned flat surfaces, that emerged from the structure here. Despite all of this refinement, with all of its piers and arches and really all the forms in Orsanmichele, they still have a splendid gravity. Their impact unites with the calm harmony of the room into the overall effect of high monumentality and a very special tone. Decor Like the building concept, the dcor of Orsanmichele is as important as the building concept. Outside and inside there is a series of masterworks of sculpture from the 14th to 16th centuries, among which are the best-preserved series of monumental statues in Florence. Inside there is also a fresco cycle and a series of stained glass  both from the era of about 1400. Exterior The Dcor of the Arcade The tracery from Simone di Francesco Talenti (c. 1366-80) is described above (p 487). Statues On each of the above described tracery posts are two figurines, one inside, one outside, so that the structure is surrounded by a wide row of statues of apostles, prophets, and saints. Almost all were replaced around the middle of the 19th century; the few preserved originals were kept in the Museo Nazionale (Bargello) (74). They have a very idiosyncratic, tense, emotional style. It is possible that around 1366-80 they were chiseled by Simone di Francesco Talenti himself. Reliefs In the wall filling of the arcade there are fifteen reliefs which were embedded later. Each represents a half figurethe twelve apostles, two evangelists (Luke and Mark) and a virtue (Veritas). They were initially intended for another purpose. They are ascribed to the Pisan Giovanni Balducci and his workshop and dated around 1336/38. Together with that, a relief of a prophet is embedded right from the group of the Quattro Coronati on the north wall, perhaps an early work of Nanni di Banco, in the beginning of the 15th century (76). The Niche Statues As a Whole. Soon after the beginning of the new building (1339), the silk guild suggested that the foremost guilds to the honor of the Madonna image, should decorate the pillars to the honor of their patron saint and should establish a ritual to these statues (77). The first guilds that decorated their posts with tabernacles and statues were the wool weavers, the silk weavers (1339/40), and the cloth dealers (end of 1340) (78). After a long period (1399), the guild of artists and apothecaries followed first with a Madonna (79). In 1401 the guild of judges and notaries decided to have their patron sculpted in stone (80). They delayed, but the execution, like the entire undertaking, they progressed slowly. In the following year (1402) the Laudesi-Brotherhood sped up the pace of things and they provided the promised honoring to their Madonna image. They had a niche made at their own expense, and having done that, a guild wanted to put there statue inside (81). Also, in 1402, the new congress of guilds developed new regulations for the decorating of niches with guild coats of arms and reliefs (81a). In 1403 the Judges and Notaries commissioned their patron saint (81). But the plan could only be carried out, with a new stronger admoniton of the implementation order. The government had to administer the old plan; on April 22, 1406 they determined, within ten years every guild will have to exhibit their patron saint, if they do not want to give up their niche (83). Finally, the work flowed. In the course of the net twenty years, all of the missing niches were decorated with statues and two of the existing older statues were replaced with more modern statues. The 1406 regulation manifested itself in Renaissance art for the first time wonderfully and programmatically at the hands of the first sculptors of Florence. The single remaining Trecento figure in that place had to be replaced by a modern statue in the early Cinquecento. Even the oldest figure in the new series was replaced in the late Cinquecento, so that there was no gothic tone to disturb the Renaissance harmony. One of the most beautiful Donatello statues (St. Ludwig) fell victim to politics and was replaced by a masterpiece by Verrocchio (83a). Niches In summary, building records of the interesting niches by Mazzanti-Del Lungo, Raccolta delle fabbriche migliori etc. di Firenze, 1876, LXXXXI ff. (84). West Faade Northern Corner Pier. In the marble niche of banking guild there is a bronze statue of the Apostle Matthew, dated to 1420. Niche and figure were produced by Lorenzo Ghiberti with the help of Michelozzo and the stone masons Jacopo di Corso and Giovanni di Niccol (85). The niche is an interesting example of the transitional style (86). The statue is the most important figure from the hand of Ghiberti. On the Tabernacle, there are two marble statues, Mary and the angel of the Annunciation, in the style of Michelozzo or of Piero di Niccol Lamberti, around 1420/30; the head of Mary is presumably new (87). Middle Pier Between the doors. Marble niche of the guild of weavers, around 1339/40 (88). Inside there is a bronze statue of St. Stephan by Lorenzo Ghiberti, 1427/28 (89). Southern Corner Pier.

East Faade Southern Corner Pier. Marble niche of the Cloth Guild, produced by the stone mason Albizzo di Pietro, the painter-architect Giuliano dArrigo named Pesello (Mosaic) and the glass worker Bernardo di Stefano based on a design by an unknown artist, 1412-14 (100). Inside, a bronze statue of John the Baptist by Lorenzo Ghiberti; signed and dated 1414 (101). Middle Pier. Marble niche, one of the oldest monuments of Renaissance architecture, made for the Guelf Party by Donatello, perhaps with the help of Michelozzo (?), 1418-1425 (102); The shell niche is framed by two spiraling fluted ionic columns and an arch enclosed in a tabernacle with to pilasters and a triangular pediment. In the pediment there is a three headed symbol of the trinity (or Prudentia ?), the emblem of the Guelf party (102a); on the architrave there are angel heads and a garland; in the spandrel, naked figures; on the pediment corners, two masks, between which the antique motif of two putti, that carry a wreath. Under this, there is a double frieze, possibly added by Verrocchio after 1463. In the niche, a bronze group shows doubting Thomas touching the side wound of Christ, the masterpiece of Andrea del Verrocchio, made for the merchants guild, that applied for the niche in 1463; 1465-1483 (103). Above it a tondo of glazed Terracotta with a lily, which is the coat of arms of the court, by Luca della Robbia, 1463 (104). North Faade Eastern Corner Pier.

Interior Statues in the arcade-tracery, in the style of Simone di Francesco Talenti, around 1366-80; see above page 491 and note 74. The Paintings History. Even before the vaults were brought in, a few frescos could be seen on the piers (115). But just after the end of the construction, it appeared that the painting began to be energetically continued. In 1387 a fresco arose on the door frame. In 1397 the government empowered the Laudesi-Brotherhood, and in the following three years, they slid certain sums of money to them for the decoration of the vaults and the walls (116). In 1403 the painters were working on this (117). The work appeared to stretch into 1408 (118). This oldest fresco cycle was not, as Vasari suggested, by Jacopo del Casentino (119), but rather by several masters of the traditional style, among which Niccol die Pietro Gerini and Ambrogio di Baldese were named in the first incomplete but published documents (120). The Decoration, like the statue series on the faade in the 15th and 16th centuries, had to be adjusted in line with High Renaissance taste. A few of the most important parts were covered with paintings and wood paneling (see under Lost Construction). In 1770 they painted over the vault and a part of the piers (121). In 1864 one of the first vault surfaces was uncovered by Gaetano Bianchi (122); In 1893-95 Dario Chini completed that work (123). Since then, for the most part one can see the frescos, all be it a bit of an overpainted condition. Many are very damaged or entirely disappeared. In 1934/35 they got rid of the paintings that were carried out on the wood panels on the columns and on the sacristy-construction in the north east and they uncovered several places of more frescos. System. A unified program underlies the decoration. The vault-caps, the transverse arch intrados, the flat decorative niches in the piers, and the wall space in the arcades held decorative figures, all of the other surfaces, especially the ribs and the front of the piers, were supposed to be enlivened with ornaments. The long, narrow pointed arch niches on the piers enticed them to affix standing holy figures; on the six-sided surfaces above them are recorded scenes from the legends of the these holy figures, because they did not want these under the feet of the figures in the predella way. Because of the import of the objects must there must be an exhaustive description here; indeed at least the greatest figures on the vaults and the piers have to be listed. We begin with the vault, follow with the wall piers from the main entrance going from the right and end with the free piers in the middle of the oratory. Each letter (a, b, c, d) marks a different pier side. Vault. In each cap, there is an existing frame of blue, gold stared background: patriarchs, ancestors of Jewish heritage, prophets, male and female saints. On the transverses arch over the portal, on every third row of standing and sitting figures, on each of the transverse arches over the arcade of the outer wall, each a row of enthroned saints, and on the rounded arches in the inside half figures in quatrefoils; the artist who carried this out, was closely affiliated with the circle of Spinelllo Artino, but also had a close connection to the painters associated with Giovanni dal Ponte und Bicci di Lorenzo. The cycle was built from 1397 to 1401 (124). Wall Piers and Wall Filling The frescoes, when otherwise not noted, are by unknown painters around 1400. Northwestern Corner Pier: without frescos; former door to the upper floor.  Wall piers between the doors: a) holy bishop b) St. Stephen c) St. Michael, dated 1387 (?), d) John the Baptists (?).

Above these saints in a six-sides field: glorification of St. Mary Magdalene, by Andrea del Sarto, beginning of the 16th century (131). The relevant fields on the other side were also painted with scenes (no longer distinguishable). Eastern Pier: a) St. Bartholomew, under his torture, above his glorification; around 1400? B) St. Lawrence, under his torture, above field indistinguishable; around 1400? C) the good theif on the cross; with inscription (132). D) St. Mary Magdalene; attributed to Giovanni dal Ponte, beginning of the 15th century (133). The Stained Glass History. Together with the frescos, a series of stained glass was carried out, that was intended to decorate above the arch field above the painted wall filling and above the doors of the wall arcade. Already in 1380 were payments were made for the leading (134). From 1394 to 1401 the heads of the brotherhood payed money toward the decorating of the frescoes and the stained glass. The stained glass panels were put up in the following ten years. They are among the most beautiful in Florence. Possibly, Agnolo Gaddi, Niccoll di Pietro Gerini and Ambrogio Baldesi, who were the creators of parts of the frescos that were being worked on at the same time, were involved with providing designs for the stained glass. Besides these artists, also L. Monaco and perhaps Ghiberti (135). Program. Scenes from Marias life and the miracles of the Madonna, especially the miracle-working Madonna, whose attribution is not really possible (136), are represented in irregular form. In the two anterior bays in each wall-arcade, only the middle tracery-arch field is furnished with stained glass; in the third, backmost bay, that served as the choir for both main altars, each wall arcade has arch area tracery with stained glass. The smaller tracery fields above the already described large tracery arches, contain in every arcade a stained glass painting, and namely heads and ornaments. West Side (Entrance Side). First (Northern) Arcade: Angel (very much destroyed), before 1400. Second Arcade: Angel, around 1860. South Side First Arcade Offerings in the temple; in the style of Agnolo Gaddi, around 1385 (?) (137). Second Arcade: Assumption of the Virgin, by Agnolo Gaddi (?) around 1385 (?) (137). Third Arcade: Three wonders of the Madonna Orsanmichele (right on the inside of this, is the miracle-working Madonna, on the left the gallows scene, and on the left the tabernacle with the miracle-working Madonna and pilgrims); maybe after the design of Agnolo Gaddi, around 1390 (?) (138). East Side First Arcade: Two miracles of the Madonna (Salvation of the soul of a pious man and snow wonder of S. Maria Maggiore in Rome) and Rest on the Flight to Egypt; especially beautily work; the Rest on the Flight perhaps after the design of Agnolo Gaddi or of a related artist (139), the salvation of the soul perhaps after the design of Lorenzo Monaco; all three windows from around 1400/1410 (14). Second Arcade: three miracles of the Madonna (the right and the middle scenes very destroyed and partially restored, left healing of the sick); the left scene perhaps after the design of Lorenzo Monaco, executed by Niccol della Magna (?), around 1400/10 (141). North Side First Arcade Three miracles of the Madonna (ship miracle, Bishops miracle, and Grotto miracle); the right and the middle scenes probably done by a miniature painter; beginning of the 15th Century (142). Second Arcade: A proclamation of Joachim; especially beautiful work, perhaps from the concept of Lorenzo Monaco, maybe from the circle that created the Ghiberti window in the cathedral (done by Niccol della Magna?) around 1410/15 (143). Third arcade: Presentation of Mary, perhaps after a concept of a painter from the circle of Agnolo Gaddi, around 1375/80 (?) (144). The Miracle-Working Madonna and its Tabernacle In the southeastern (right rear) corner bay of the interior. History. On a pier of the granary from 1285 there was a Madonna image; whether it was a fresco or a panel is uncertain (145). Varsari named its creator as Ugolino da Siena (146). In honor of the Madonna image, a confraternity was founded on August 10, 1292, that created itself after the example of the Laudesi-Brotherood in S. Maria Novella especially in the fact that they made it their mission to sing artistic hymns (147). Shortly before their founding, on July 3, 1292, the Marian image miraculously began to heal the sick (148). Therefore, the brotherhood of the them grew conveniently, although the Dominicans and the Franciscans, in the best interest of their own brotherhoods, made life difficult for the brotherhood (149). Regarding a small wooden structure on which the pier with the Madonna image was secured in 1294, see page 485 and Note 56. Whether it survived the fire of 1304, or whether it was replaced at that time with a copy, or whether Ugolinio of Sienna just then delivered the Madonna image, is unknown (150). Copies of these two (?) oldest paintings are not verifiable (151). While these points are still controversial, the opinion that was popularized in the 17th century prevails today, that the current miracle-working Madonna was neither the work of Ugolino nor the hypothetical panel of 1304, but rather a creation from the middle of the 14th century (152). One party considered it a creation of Orcagna (153), the other, the side that finally won out, consider it a work of Bernardo Daddi, who in 1347 verifiably painted a Madonna image for the brotherhood of Orsanmichele (154). The Miracle-Working Image. Large panel: enthroned Madonna and child, adored by eight angels; by Bernardo Daddi; Masterpiece from his late period, 1347; restored 1938/40; well preserved (154). The Tabernacle. Masterpiece of Andrea Orcagna, inscribed and dated 1359 (155). For the Madonna of Daddi, a sumptuous tabernacle was planned, as soon as the brotherhood overcame the legacy of the 1348 plague and had more means at their disposal (156). In 1349 the contract was granted to Orcagna (157). The work was apparently begun in 1352 (158). In 1360 the composition of the complicated structure was apparently still underway (159). The Architecture (160). The square ciborium is made of white marble. Above a stepped-foundation (161) arises a quite high base floor, on each of the four corners there is a correspondingly high pier base; on the four walls there are large octagonal and small hexagonal decorative fields (alternating with each other), that are filled with reliefs. Above that is the main floor, an open structure with four corner piers, four of these carried round arches and a cross ribbed vault; it is sealed from behind through quite thick wall filling, on whose front side there is a miracle image and on whose backside there is a large relief; whether in the inner part of this wall filling is a remains of the original miraculous image has to be further investigated, that is the remains of the specific pier from the first and second granary; Above the arch apex of the main floor there is a horizontal frieze. Above that, there arises the crowning: on each corner there is a pinnacle, on each side a gable in the form of a nearly isosceles triangle, in the middle a high, thin, pointed, melon dome with finials on the edges. Gothic tendencies become clear only in these crowing forms. The main part of structure has the peaceful, powerful relationship of the surrounding church room. The appearance of the rounded arch and the high pier step on it reveals that Orcagna borrowed his architectural thoughts from it. The pier framework of the tabernacle  square with three twisted columns before the beveled outer corners and the same column pairs are in the openings under the arches  enhances the corresponding motif of the surrounding monumental building in the celebratory way, that the specific purpose of the tabernacle requires. For the same reasons, the enclosure is most luxuriously decorated. All the sides that are related to the enclosure are decorated with marble reliefs, encrusted with red and black marble ornaments and inlaid with red, blue, and gold glass. The capitals were marked with ionic blossoms and volutes, for which there were no precursors in the monumental structures of the past. Also, gilding is richly used. With the expense of all previously known means of art and with creative fantasy, Orcagna has created a wonder of trecento decorative art in Florence. The Sculptures. Extraordinarily rich program in the style of the cycles on the pulpits of Niccol and Giovanni Pisano and on the ciboria of Arnolfo di Cambio, however one of the goals of the miraculous image tabernacle is to correspond with the glorification of Mary. Base. Marys life is told on the four walls in eight octagonal reliefs; in the north (left) Marys birth and Marys presentation, in the west, the wedding and the proclamation, in the south, the birth of Christ and the worship of the kings, in the east the presentation of Christ in the temple and the death proclamation to Mary. In this Mary-cycle, an episode of the presentation of the virtues is engaged; Between every two of the mentioned octagonal reliefs, there is a on the north, west, and south side, there is a heptagon with a relief figures of each virtue (Fides, Spes, Caritas); on the backside there is a half figure of a manly saint. (perhaps a prophet?). The virtue series continues with the half figure reliefs on the pier base. On the middle corner field of each base there is each cardinal virtue (together four), on the lateral field next to it, two other virtues (all together eight), and on the once again protruding lateral corner field of each pier base, there are two manly half figures, probably prophets or ancestors of Mary (together eight). Main floor. Above the capitals of the colonettes on the corner pier there are twelve apostle statues; in the spandrel of the arches on the front side and on the flanks there are angel heads; on the frieze half figures of angels and saints. Around the miraculous image there is a marble curtain that is pulled back by angels. Behind it, the backside of the tabernacle is filled by a many-figured relief: the death of Mary and above the handing down of the belt to the apostle Thomas; under the figures on the deathbed of Mary there is a self-portrait of Orcagna (Man with a cowl, to the right), the oldest still existing, reliably identified realistic art self-portrait in western Christian art (162). Crowning. On the top of each ornamental gable and on the dome, each an angel statuette.  The Question of Masters. The sculptures can only be attributed in small part to Orcagna. Ghiberti reports, the master singlehandedly carried out the narrated representations (163). Vasari thinks, that all the figural representations can be traced to Organa and his brother, which the ornamental can be attributed to help from many different lands (164),. K. Steinweg assumed that most of the reliefs were designs of Orcagna and the participation of various help, and the death of Mary and the wedding and the proclamation take them completely out of the realm of having been done alone (165). Meaning. The reliefs of the tabernacle are the most important monument of Florentine sculpture between Andrea Pisano and Donatello. They combine the style of the oldest baptistery door with the spatial construction and the feel for human bodies of Giotto-esque painting and laid the ground for the Renaissance development in decisive ways (166). The ornamentation is largely without precursor. Capitals like the flower-decorated fluted capitals of the corner columns do not exist in Florentine gothic anymore than does the splendid foliage and the shell ornamentation of the pier filling. The boldness of these forms is emphasized even more livelier by the lightening colors of the glass ground. Gates. Above the tabernacle around lies a finely worked marble gate with bronze latticing; carried out in 1366 by the goldsmith Pietro del Migliore; The angel statuettes, who stand on the four columns on their corners, stem from the workshop of Orcagna (167). Floor. From colored marble; by Daniele di Bartolo and Francesco Teri, 1380 (168). The St. Anne Altar In the northeastern (left behind) bay of the interior History. On the St. Anne day of the 1343 the Duke of Athens was driven out of Florence. In memory of this event, the city government made St. Anne the patron of the city and errected an altar in Orsanmichele (169). This construction was done in all haste made of wood and was already in use in January 1344 (170). On the altar, a wood statue of St. Anne Selbdritt. In 1349 the government considered a church for the St. Anne cult across from Orsanmichele (171). When it was completed a few decades later, they left the St. Anne altar in its old place and dedicated the new church to St. Michael. Above the old altar a new St. Anne statue was placed in 1526. In 1575 the heads of the brotherhood of Orsanmichele asked the grand duke Francesco I, if he would grant them the means to replace the 14th century wood altar with a marble one (172). The altar that was built as a result of this request is dated to 1586. In 1770 it was covered over with a Baroque decoration and in 1909 brought back to its original condition (173).

Date of the cornerstone ceremony according to Del Migliore, 1684, 530 July 29th from the Diary of Rocco di Domenico Spinelli and Gaye I, 50 July 18th; see Mazzanti-Del Lungo, Raccolta etc., 1876, 31.  According to Del Migliore the foundation occured in the name of the then-prevailing Guelf Party.  Richa I, 1754, 15/16 dates the described events based on a document, that he publishes, erroneously in 1309. (22) Vasari I, 576. See also Kugler, Gesch. D. Baukunst, III, 1859, 553. Although no single construction is attested to Taddeo through documents as of yet, this painter, Giottos favorite student, in my opinion comes into question for the design of Or S. Michele, because the building concept is very close to Giottos cathedral Campanile. (23) As a first step, Gelli attributed  around the mid-sixteenth century  Orsanmichele to Orcagna (see Steinweg, Orcagna, 1929, 10, 44). Del Migliore takes parts of the building for Orcagnas work (1684, 531; Seinweg, 44). The opinion of Vasari: Arnolfo built the first hall of Orsanmichele, but Taddeo Gaddi the second, Richa looks to reconcile with Del Migliores opinion, in which he wrote, Arnolfo, Taddeo and Orcagna worked on Orsanmichele one after another. Gaye looked for a confirmation of acceptance, Orcagna had a share in the construction of Orsanmichele, in which he proved, that the master was named as Capomaestro of the Oratoriums of Orsanmichele between February 13, 1355 and March 29, 1357 (I, 1839, 52), whereby the fact also holds true, that Orcagna named himself as Oratorii archimagister in the 1359 inscription on the Tabernacle of Orsanmichele. Nevertheless, other writers of the 19th century say, only a part of the structure could be attributed to the master, and in particular the padding of the great arcades: Fantozzi, Guida, 1842, 309; Perkins, Tuscan Sculptors, I, 1864, 79; also similar Burkhardt, Cicerone, 1855, 576; Kugler, Gesch. D. Baukunst, III, 1869, 353; Schnaase, Geschichte der Bildenden Knste im Mittelalter, v, 1876, 183. But Passerini authenticated, that these traceries originated with Simone di Francesco Talenti (Steinweg, Orcagna, 1929, 45). Frey concluded that, Orcanga had nothing to do with the structure himself in his capacity as Capomaestro, but rather only with its decoration, such as the likewise the mentioned stone mason Giovanni di Fetto at the Cathedral (Loggia dei Lanzi, 1885, 104). I add on still: perhaps not the church, but rather the tabernacle of the image of mercy was intended with Oratorium? The hall itself was indeed in Orcangas time not yet an Oratorium, but rather a grain market. At any rate, Klara had Steinweg correct, when she rejected on grounds of stylistic critique, an involvement of Orcagna at the structure (ibid. 45). For this rejection, Tosi, Boll. dA. XXVII, 1934, 514 ff. has since produced a concise argument (24) Neri di Fioravanti and Francesco Talenti were considered first by Franceschini (Or S. Michele, 1892, 25). Neri di Fioranvanti had connections to the Bauhtte of Orsanmichele twelve years after the start of construction; that is proved documentarily; In 1349/51 he managed the new construction of S. Michele Vecchio with Benci di Cione (S. Carlo Borromeo I; see Band II, 418, Note 5), and this new construction was subordinate to the heads of the Laudesi-Brotherhood of Orsanmichele, indeed this new construction was most likely taken care of by the same builders guild; Benci managed also around 1366 the construction of the upper parts of Orsanmichele (see below). Neri also, and Benci certainly later, probably belonged to the Bauhtte of Orsanmichele. Still the components that the two masters carried out in the great room of the Bargello-Palace in 1340-46 (Paatz, Mitt. Inst. Florenz, III, 1931, 311-14) differ considerably from the motifs of Orsanmichele; the coarse forms of the pilasters and the windows in the room have nothing at all in common with them [the motifs from Orsanmichele], and the arch construction technique also made use of the rounded arch (for the diagonal ribbing) and the pointed arch (for the vaulting). In this situation of things, I would like to consider the possibility, that Neri and Benchi worked for Orsanmichele (like for example demonstrably for the cathedral and its Campanile) also at most as stonemasons or at best as foremen, but not as progenitors of the project. A certain choice however will first be allowed to be made, when the building style of both masters, which became for now still not individually tangible, becomes better understood.  About a relationship, that links Orsanmichele with a part of the Bargello-Palace established by Tone di Giovannis, see below Note 71 (end). Francesco Talenti is not mentioned in the documents in connection with Orsanmichele; yet he comes into consideration as creator of the architectural concept of Orsanmichele. Because he made the columns and spatial conditions of the nave of S. Maria del Fiore (see Band III, S. 330/31 and S. 445 f. Notes 66 and 67), and he assumed the corresponding motives of Orsanmichele; this conviction has been broadly popular since Franceschini. Siebenhner actually ventured to attribute Orsanmichele to Francesco Talenti (Thieme-Becker XXXII, 1938, 415). Whether this opinion answers the question definitively must be awaited. Against [this], it could be argued, that when comparing between Orsanmichele and the cathedral nave, outside of the similarities, significant differences exist: in the cathedral itself, instead of the rounded arch, that is predominant in Orsanmichele, one finds again the pointed arch; also the proportions of the cathedral columns are less balanced; the cathedral comes across less harmonically and therefore more dynamically, more austerely, and more sparsely. These differences can be explained by the different eras in which the two structures were built; Talentis cathedral nave first developed in 1357 and following, therefore a full twenty years after the start date of Orsanmichele; one could also try to make it comprehensible through the evidence, that Talenti verifiably at times during the cathedral construction had taken into account the wishes of other artists and critics (see Band III, page 449, Note 67, conclusion). The question, whether the aforementioned difference seriously carries weight against the attribution of Orsanmichele to Talenti or not, can be only reliably answered if the research should succeed in more clearly defining Talentis character and the outlines of his art. Jacopo Talenti whom Franceschini also considers (Or S. Michele 1892, 25), in my opinion, is eliminated, because his architectural concepts (see under S. Maria Novella) have common general tendencies with Orsanmichele, but also no more. Andrea Pisano comes into consideration just a little: his part at the Campanile of S. Maria del Fiore has nothing at all to do with Orsanmichele stylistically. (25) Document in Gaye I, 1839, 46 f. (26) Document in Gaye I, 1839, 46 f. In the year 1340 two columns with tabernacles and statues were furnished, and a third was supposed to be attained for the exact same decorative purpose? (Document by Frey-Vasari I, 1911, 379).

That on that occasion a conclusion was reached, emerges clearly from a document from November 14, 1358: at that time, the confraternity of Orsanmichele turned their income to other aims, because their own building was finished (Guasti, S. Maria del Fiore, 1887, 132 f.); It will presumably involve the church, not the mercy-image tabernacle, because this was still in progress in 1359/60 (See under Facilities).

O. 36) begrndete diese Ansetzung mit dem Stil der Reliefs, die in diesen Backsteinwnden enthalten sind; diese Reliefs wurden jedoch schon vorher fr eine andere Verwendung geschaffen (vgl. unter Ausstattung, S. 491). Da eines von ihnen gelegentlich der Einmauerung zur Vervollstndigung des Zyklus nachtrglich zugefgt wurde und als ein Jugendwerk des Nanni di Banco gilt, knnte man sich versucht fhlen, die Schlieung der Arkaden erst um 1400 anzusetzen. Doch scheint mir die Einsetzung von Fenstern, die 1380 erfolgte (vgl. oben), die Schlieung der Arkaden bereits vorauszusetzen. (38) Franceschini (ibid. 36) justified this approach with the style of the reliefs, that are included in this brick wall; these Reliefs were created in the first place for another use (See under Ausstattung, pg. 491). Because one of them was subsequently attributed to the masonry work for the completion of the series and applies as an early work of Nanni di Banco, one could feel himself tempted to position the closing of the arcade first around 1400. It seems to me the installation of windows, that took place in 1380 (see oben) already assumed the closure of the arcade. (39) See Foll.-Rastr. VI, 1795, 170 f.; See also Note 50.

(62) It can be discussed only hintingly in this book.  Description. In each floor lancet windows (Biforien) open as the most important partition arrangement. The upper closing of the upper floor and thereby of the whole building forms a considerably protruding cornice, that is built from small calm arches of corbels. The described building elements have a most excellent place in the history of Florentine palace construction. Through the striking size of their windows, through the release of rustication of the exterior walls and through the subtlety of their profile, they take an advance above the Palazzo Vecchio and xxx the xx, that Brunelleschi xx I the upper floor of the Palace of the Guelf Party.  The Type of the tower-like city granary appears in France; the could be sole known medieval example in Pierrelatte (Drme) in the absence of distinct style, unfortunately cannot be exactly dated; the example in Ardes (Pas de Calais) seemingly originates from the 16th or 17th century. See C. Enlart, Manuel darchologie franaise, II, 1904, 198. (63) A precursor, which largely compares to Orsanmichele, is the Arnolfian Bath. (63a) Such grain chute distribution appliances also appear in French storage facilities, which are not dated clearly, but likely after Orsanmichele was established: C. Enlart, Mauel darchologie franaise, II, 1904, 198. (64) See M. Reymond, La sculpture Florentine I 1897, 203/04 and Venturi, Storia IV, 1906, 706 f. A few of the statues are now replaced by copies; the originals are located in the Bargello, a few maybe also in the great cloister of S. Marco (Sinibaldi, Il museuo di S. Marco, 1936, 38).  Construction documentations (very summarized!) by Mazzanti-Del Lungo, Raccolta, 1876, LXXXVI, LXXXVII and by Rohault de Fleury, 1, 1870.  In my opinion, the motifs stem from the magnificent tracery-motifs, that the father of Simone Talenti, Francesco, established in the upper floor of the Campanile of S. Maria del Fiore.  About the account of the installation of the tracery, see the Building History. After its installation, the tracery must have seemed very similar to that in the Camposanto in Pisa (likewise subsequently configured). (65) The peculiar cross and crenellated patterns of these barriers originate from the decorative forms of the cathedral faade. They could appear on the base step of the main door and on the base step of the northern corner posts (from the sketch from 1486: Figure 99 by Paatz, Werden und Wesen der Tecentoarchitektur, 1937) and could have been created by Arnolfo di Cambio , but also by Francesco Talenti, who verifiably had taken part in the main door (see Band III, pg. 443, note 65). Simone Talenti probably adopted this motif from the decorative forms of his father. (66) About the purpose of this filling wall, see the Building History. (67) About this Wimperg-Type see Reymond, Riv. dA. I, 1904, 245ff.  For the doors also see note 45. (68) See Exterior.  The building type of the column hall has been adopted clearly from the two older, previously existing, on this site granaries (See under Reconstruction). According to Patzak, they were brought together with granaries in French cloisters. (Die Renaissance- und Barockvilla in Italien, I, 1912, 88.) Nevertheless, C. Enlart, who describes such systems, names nothing of the sort (Manuel darchologie franaise, II, 1904, 197/98). Perhaps it has given a few more preliminary stages in Byzantium. Hence, I would like to conclude, that it is preserved in the Constantinople secular buildings of a related type from the time of Emperor Justinian; there are storage halls, whose vaults rest on columns (Cistern of Philoxenos from 519; Cistern of Jere-batan-Serai Bodrum, also called Basilika, from 520), or on piers (Cistern of Eschwefije-Sokagh; post-Justinian); see. O. Wulff, Altchristliche und byzantinische Kunst, 1914, 404 (with Note); there is yet another Italian early-Renaissance structure, that corresponds to this Byzantine type, the Santa Maria in Portico a Fontegiusta in Siena. Perhaps in Byzantium, in the city with the richest medieval secular architecture, there are also market halls of according appearance, and perhaps the two older Orsanmichele halls were inspired from such models. (69) The fulfillment of this effort was supported through the fact, that here a planned (market)hall was to be built. The building master had a favorable site, but with more sure mastery. That informs the subsequently described design of the individual forms. (70) Width : Length = 2 : 3 (71) As early as Del Migliore, 1684, 532.  The gothic arch had dominated the Florentine ecclesiastical monumental architecture since the beginning of the new construction of S. Maria Novella (around 1246) until Arnolfo and Giotto. - The Round Arch. On monumental secular structures this older arch form survived occasionally during this era. For example in the Loggia in the court of the Bargello Palace (around 1280/85: see Paatz, Mitt. Inst. Florenz III, 1931, 302ff.) and in the windows of the Palazzo Vecchio (ibid. Figures. Page 313)  both instances presumably in the Arnolfian framework. In church architecture, the round arch was tolerated only outside the circle of the monumental building; on side structures like the portico of S. Jacopo in Campo Corbolini (see Band II, pg. 402 and pg. 408 note 22) and the Chiostro delle Oblate at S. Maria Nuova (1289ff. see Band IV, pg. 12) or on small churches like S. Giovannino dei Cavalieri (1329-36; see Band II. pg. 307; this church for example belongs in the typical style of Arnolfo di Cambio). Orsanmichele (1337ff), the first monumental church, on which the rounded arch appeared again, was conceived as a secular building. Round-arched vault construction The connection of half-circle formed transverse arches and segmented diagonal ribs that you can see on Orsanmichele has been verified on Florentine gothic building since this connection was applied around 1280/85 in the recessed court balcony of the Bargello palace (Mitt. Inst. Florenz, III, 1931, 302 ff.: with note). The forms in Orsanmichele are especially similar to the upper court balconies of the same palace built by Tonne di Giovanni 1320ff. because in them there are not only the same arch forms that are combined but also the diagonal edges of the abutting semi-circular arch, exactly like the outer arcade of Orsanmichele (see Building History, Exterior); and also above the Loggia of Tone di Giovanni see Mitt. Inst. Florenz III, 1931, 308-09 and the notes on pages 305, 310. (72) Nardini found the evolutionary meaning of the post form, indeed without specifying (Il Duomo di S. Giovanni, 1902, 173). Clearly the characteristic connection of gothic logic and Italian simplicity is clearly recognizable. (73) The Gothic arch panels probably come from the Arnolfian decorative wall elements on the outer flanks of S. Maria del Fiore (see Band III, pg. 348, 350). The hexagon that is on the peak is obviously from Giottos faade on the Campanile of S. Maria del Fiore. Paatz, Rm, Jb. V, 1941, 204. (74) Museo Nazionale Nr. 22, 26, 61, 64, 66, 75, 77, 81.

Wahrscheinlich ist er eine volkstmliche Abwandlung des Namens der vorher dort befindlichen Kirche ,,S. Michaelis in Orto, der besagt, da diese Kirche in Grten lag; dieser Name ist 1239 urkundlich bezeugt (1). - Eine andere Deutung sieht in dem Beiwort Or eine Anspielung auf den Getreidespeicher (lateinisch horreum), der die ltere Kirche ersetzte (2), doch wird diese Annahme durch das Vorkommen des Wortes Orto im Jahre 1239, also vor der Grndung des Kornspeichers, wiederlegt. Baugeschichte An der Stelle von Or San Michele befand sich ursprnglich ein kleines Nonnenkloster mit einer Kirche namens S. Michaelis in Orto; es wurde 895 als eine bereits seit langem bestehende Stiftung des Abtes Peter von S. Silvestro in Nonantola bezeichnet (3) und ist vielleicht bald nach der Grndung des Mutterklosters (752) eingerichtet worden, da es noch dem Kult des langobardischen Nationalheiligen geweiht wurde (4). Das Kloster blieb im Besitz der berhmten oberitalienischen Abtei, so lange es bestand (5). Es scheint im Florentiner Kulturleben als eine der ersten Pflegsttten der Webekunst schon whrend des 9. Jahrhunderts eine gewisse Bedeutung gehabt zu haben (6). 1046 stand S. Michele in Orto unter der Verwaltung eines Propstes (7); das Nonnenkloster existierte also mglicherweise nicht mehr. Im Jahre 1239 wurde die Kirche anscheinend in einer Geschlechterfehde zerstrt, und zwar durch Schuld des Munaldus Ranutius und anderer Florentiner Brger (8). Des neugewonnenen Raumes im Zentrum der Stadt bemchtigte sich die Stadtverwaltung, um einen ffentlichen Platz herzurichten (9). Einige Jahrzehnte spter, im Februar 1285, lie sie eben dort eine offene Halle fr den Kornmarkt auffhren (10). Dieser Bau soll von Arnolfo di Cambio errichtet worden sein (11) und war 1290 bereits in Gebrauch (12). An einem seiner Pfeiler war ein Madonnenbild angebracht worden. Dieses begann im Jahre 1292 auf wunderbare Weise Kranke zu heilen; seitdem wurde die Halle eine der wichtigsten Kultsttten der Stadt und der Sitz einer mchtigen Bruderschaft, die regelmig Lobgesnge zu Ehren des Gnadenbildes veranstaltete und deshalb ,,Laudesi genannt wurde (13). Immerhin diente die Halle noch einige weitere Jahrzehnte hindurch auch ihrem ursprnglichen profanen Zweck.Im Jahre 1304 fiel sie mit ihrem ganzen Stadtviertel dem Brande zum Opfer, den Ser Neri Abati im Verlauf eines Geschlechterkampfes angelegt hatte (14). 1307 begann man mit der Errichtung des Ersatzbaus (15). Diese zweite, 1308 noch unvollendete Halle scheint nicht sehr solide geraten zu sein (16). Schon 1321 drohte sie zusammenzustrzen und mute repariert werden (17). Dasselbe wiederholte sich dann noch einmal im Jahre 1332 (18). Mglicherweise hat die berschwemmung von 1333, whrend der das Wasser in der Halle zwei Ellen hoch stand (19), den Verfall des Gebudes von neuem beschleunigt. Jedenfalls stellte die Regierung 1336 in aller Form fest, da die Halle wegen ihrer geringen Gre die Menge des aufgespeicherten Getreides nicht gengend schtzen knne und auerdem geradezu einen Schandfleck im Stadtbild darstelle; es solle, so beschlo sie, an ihrer Stelle eine neue Halle entstehen, und zwar ein richtiger Palast, gro genug, um das Korn besser aufzubewahren und dem Kult des wunderttigen Madonnenbildes einen wrdigen Rahmen zu bieten, schn genug, um dem Staat Ehre zu machen; zugleich wurde eine Kommission eingesetzt, um den Neubau in Gang zu bringen (20). Am 29. Juli des folgenden Jahres erfolgte die feierliche Grundsteinlegung in Gegenwart aller Behrden; zugleich wurde festgesetzt, da ber dem neu zu bauenden Gnadenbild-,,Oratorium zwei gewlbte Geschosse als Kornspeicher zu errichten wren, und zwei Jahre spter, da die Znfte (als Mittrger der Stadtregierung) an dem neuen Palast ihre Schutzpatrone aufzustellen htten, derart, da jeder Pfeiler der Halle mit einem Heiligen geschmckt wrde (21). Das groartige Wahrzeichen des florentinischen Gemeinwesens, das dann in jahrzehntelanger Arbeit hier erwuchs und von jeher als eines der vollkommensten Denkmler fiorentinischer Gotik und Renaissance bewundert wird, ist also schon damals mit vollem Bewutsein und in seinem ganzen Umfang geplant worden. Wer den Entwurf fr den Neubau geliefert und damit eine neue Epoche in der Entwicklung der Florentiner Gotik eingeleitet hat, ist ungewi. Der Maler Taddeo Gaddi, dem Vasari dieses Verdienst zu schreibt, kommt in Betracht (22), Andrea Orcagna nicht (23). Auerdem kommen dafr in Frage Neri di Fioravanti, Benci di Cione und vor allem Francesco Talenti, deren sptere Bauten und Schulbauten, der Dom und die Loggia deLanzi, eine folgerichtige Entfaltung des Stils von Or San Michele brachten (24). Bauherrin war als Vertreterin der Stadtregierung die Zunft der Seidenweber (25). Der Bau mu in den ersten Jahren ziemlich schnell gefrdert worden sein. Anfang 1339 standen schon Teile von mehreren der zehn Pfeiler, und der Rest sollte unmittelbar folgen (26). - Im Herbst desselben Jahres und im Jahre 1342 stellte die Regierung weitere Mittel fr den Bau bereit (27). 1343 stiftete sie einen St. Annenkult in Or San Michele, um den Tag der Vertreibung des Herzogs von Athen in feierlicher Erinnerung zu halten. Damals entschlo man sich anscheinend, dem begonnenen Markthallengescho des Neuhaus in hherem Grade den Charakter einer Kirche zu geben (28). Bald danach scheinen die Arbeiten allmhlich langsamer geworden und schlielich durch die Pest von 1348 gnzlich ins Stocken geraten zu sein. Die Pfeiler stehen fertig, mit ihren Fresken geschmckt, die Lehrgerste fr die Gewlbe sind errichtet, und wenn nicht bald Mittel zur Weiterfhrung des Baues bewilligt werden, so mu das alles verderben, berichtet die Seidenzunft am 19. April 1350 anschaulich und Hilfe flehend an die Stadtverwaltung (29). Wirklich mu sie dadurch das Unternehmen wieder in Gang gebracht haben. Wenig spter erfolgt die Bestellung eines kostbaren Tabernakels fr das wunderttige Madonnenbild; das lt vermuten, da man sicher auf eine baldige Vollendung der Kirche rechnete, und im April des Jahres 1357 scheinen deren Gewlbe bereits fertig gewesen zu sein (30). Um dieselbe Zeit (1361) verlegte die Regierung den Getreidemarkt von der Piazza di Or San Michele weg, um dem nahezu fertigen Tabernakel eine wrdige Umgebung zu sichern (31). Damit war ein weiterer, entscheidener Schritt in der allmhlichen Eroberung des Gebudes durch den Kult getan. Die vollstndige Verwischung aller Spuren der ursprnglichen, profanen Zweckbestimmung wurde 1366 beschlossen, whrend die Errichtung der oberen, auch weiterhin zur Kornspeicherung bestimmten Rume unter Leitung von Benci di Cione langsam voranschritt (32). Damals wurden sich die Vorsteher einig, die Arkaden des Erdgeschosses durch Mawerk zu vergittern und die offene Halle dadurch in eine geschlossene Kirche zu verwandeln (33). Im selben Jahre wurde die Besorgung des Altardienstes den Mnchsorden genommen, die sie in einem bestimmten Turnus erledigt hatten, und einem eigens dafr angestellten Sakristan bertragen (34). Am 2. April 1367 (nach anderen am 11. April 1366) waren zwei Bogenfllungen bereits begonnen, und man bedeutete dem Simone di Francesco Talenti, er solle diese von ihm geschaffenen Probestcke vollenden, dann aber weitere Weisungen der Baubehrde abwarten (35). Von einer Fortfhrung der Arbeit ist erst wieder 1378 und 1380 die Rede. Als leitender Baumeister erscheint von neuem Simone di Francesco Talenti; als ausfhrende, anscheinend recht ungeschickte Krfte werden die Steinmetzen Antonio di Francesco, Giovanni di Buonafede, Leonardo Masi, Matteo di Cione, Lorenzo di Filippo genannt, die man verschiedentlich zwang, fr verpfuschte Arbeit Ersatz zu leisten (36). 1380 drfte die Einfgung des Mawerks in die Arkaden zum Abschlu gekommen sein, denn in diesem Jahre ist von der Versetzung von Fenstern die Rede (37). - Damals hatte man sich also wohl auch bereits entschlossen, das Stabwerk in den Arkaden mit Mauern zu verschlieen (38). Doch blieben die mittleren ffnungen in den mittleren Arkaden der beiden Langseiten offen und erhielten sich in diesem Zustand bis zum Jahre 1770 (39). 1380 scheint sich auch der Bau der oberen Stockwerke des Palastes dem Abschlu genhert zu hahen. Damals wurde Marmor besorgt, wohl fr die Prunkfenster (40), und am Dach gearbeitet (41). Die Beschleunigung der Arbeiten kurz vor 1380 mag damit zusammenhngen, da 1376 die Laudesi-Bruderschaft die Bauleitung an Stelle der Seidenzunft bertragen bekam (42). Um 1380 stand die Kirche also im wesentlichen so da, wie sie heute erhalten ist Doch blieb noch einige Kleinarbeit zu leisten. 1384 wurde ein Zehntel der Einknfte der Bruderschaft fr die Weiterfhrung des Baus bestimmt; 1397 neue Zahlungen (43). 1404 wurde das Kranz-Gesims des Palastes aufgesetzt (44). 1408 und 1410 fhrte Niccol di Piero Lamberti die vielleicht schon frher begonnen Arbeiten an den beiden Hauptportalen zu Ende; sein Anteil ist heute nicht mehr sicher abzugrenzen (45). 1415 richtete man ein Kollegiatstift in der Kirche ein (46). Um 1480 wurde sie vorbergehend profaniert (47). Sie erlitt aer niemals ernstliche Vernderungen. 1569 wurde das Obergescho des Palastes als Staatsarchiv eingerichtet (48) und mit dem gegenberliegenden Amtsgebude der Wollweberzunft ber die Strae hinweg durch eine berfhrung verbunden, und zwar angeblich durch Bernardo Buontalenti. 1628 vermauerte man das rechte, sdliche Hauptportal der Fassade (49). 1770 wurden die bis dahin im unteren Teil offengebliebenen mittleren ffnungen in den mittleren Arkaden der Flanken vermauert; gleichzeitig baute man im linken, nrdlichen Chorjoch eine Sakristei ein (50). 1821 wurde das Bogenfeld unter dem Verbindungsbogen des Buontalenti entfernt, 1858 wieder erneuert (51). 1852 ff. wurden die dekorativen Teile der Arkaden zum groen Teil ausgewechselt (52). 1901 fand eine neue Restaurierung statt (53). 1931 ff. wurde der Fuboden in den beiden vorderen Jochen des Oratoriums, der nachtrglich auf das etwas hhere Niveau des letzten (Chor-)Joches gebracht worden war, wieder in den ursprnglichen Zustand versetzt und der Sakristei-Einbau entfernt. Rekonstruktion der Verlorener Bauzustnde Kirche und Kloster S. Michaelis in Orto. ber den karolingischen Klosterbau des 8. oder 9. Jahrhunderts ist nur bekannt, da er eine Werkstatt fr Wollweberei enthielt (54). Die Kirche wird ganz klein gewesen sein, da der Konvent nur aus wenigen Nonnen bestand (885 waren es 6 Schwestern). Die erste Kornhalle; 1285, von Arnolfo di Cambio (?). Zierlicher Hausteinbau mit zehn Pfeilern (55). - Der Pfeiler mit dem berhmten Gnadenhild (vgl. unten S. 499) war schon 1294 mit einem hlzernen Httchen umbaut, das die Andchtigen gegen die Ahendluft schtzen sollte (56). Ob von diesem Pfeiler noch ein berrest vorhanden ist (im jetzigen Gnadenbild-Tabernakel), wre zu klren; vgl. dazu S. 499 f. Die zweite Kornhalle; 1308 ff. Sie war wesentlich kleiner als der heutige Bau (57) und hatte dnne, schlecht fundamentierte Backsteinpfeiler (58). An einem der Pfeiler das Gnadenbild; ob sich ein berrest dieses Pfeilers erhalten hat (im jetzigen Gnadenbild-Tabernakel), wre noch zu klren; vgl. dazu S. 499 f. Baubeschreibung Allgemeines.

Der Baugedanke von Or San Michele ist ein Unikum: in ihm verbinden sich die architektonischen Typen der Markthalle, des Speicherhauses und des Bruderschafts-Oratoriums zu einer Einheit, die nur durch das Zusammentreffen ganz besonderer geschichtlicher Umstnde zustande kommen konnte (60). Das Erdgescho  als Markthalle begonnen  ist eine gewlbte Pfeilerhalle; es war ursprnglich offen und wurde erst nach einem Planwechsel durch Vermauerung der ueren Arkaden in einen geschlossenen Kirchenraum verwandelt (61). Darber erheben sich zwei hohe, als Kornspeicher errichtete Obergeschosse (62). Der ursprnglich beabsichtigte Gegensatz zwischen der offenen Pfeilerhalle und dem darber aufstrebenden turmhausartigen Block der Speichergeschosse mu sehr eigenartig gewirkt haben.

Kritische Bemerkungen bei Schnaase, Geschichte der Bildenden Knste im Mittelalter, V, 1876, 183; doch knnte Arnolfo die Halle wirklich erbaut haben, da diese ein Bau der Regierung war und da er um 1300 nachweislich der Florentiner Regierungsbaumeister war.

Nach Del Migliore geschah die Grndung im Namen der damals herrschenden Welfen-Partei.  Richa I, 1754, 15/16 datiert die beschriebenen Vorgnge auf Grund einer Urkunde, die er abdruckt, versehentlich ins Jahr 1309. (22) Vasari I, 576. Vgl. auch Kugler, Gesch. D. Baukunst, III, 1859, 553. Obwohl fr Taddeo bisher kein einziges Bauwerk urkundlich bezeugt ist, kommt dieser Maler, Giottos Lieblingschler, m. E. fr den Entwurf von Or S. Michele in Betracht, weil der Baugedanke dem Dom-Campanile Giottos ganz nahe steht. (23) Als erster schreib Gelli  um die Mitte des 16. Jahrhunderts  Or San Michele dem Orcagna zu (vgl. Steinweg, Orcagna, 1929, 10, 44). Teile des Baues hielt auch Del Migliore fr Orcagnas Werk (1684, 531; Seinweg, 44). Die Meinung Vasaris, Arnolfo habe die erste Halle von Or San Michele gebaut, Taddeo Gaddi aber die zweite, suchte Richa mit Del Migliores Meinung zu vershnen, indem er schrieb, Arnolfo, Taddeo und Orcagna htten nacheinander an Or San Michele gearbeitet. Gaye versuchte eine Besttigung der Annahme, Orcagna habe einen Anteil am Bau von Or San Michele genannt wird (I, 1839, 52), wozu auch die Tatsache stimmt, da Orcagna sich selbst in der 1359 datierten Inschrift am Tabernakel von Or San Michele Oratorii archimagister nannte. Doch meinten andere Schriftsteller des 19. Jahrhunderts, dem Meister knne nur ein Teil des Bauwerkes zugeschrieben werden, und zwar vor allem das Fllwerk der groen Arkaden: Fantozzi, Guida, 1842, 309; Perkins, Tuscan Sculptors, I, 1863, 79; hnlich auch Burckhardt, Cicerone, 1855, 576; Kugler, Gesch. d. Baukunst, III, 1859, 353; Schnaase, Geschichte der Bildenden Knste im Mittelalter, V, 1876, 183. Doch wies Passerini dann urkundlich nach, da diese Fllungen von Simone di Francesco Talenti stammten (Seinweg, Orcagna, 1929, 45). Frey folgerte daraus, Orcagna habe in seiner Eigenschaft als Capomaestro nichts mit dem Bau selbst zu tun gehabt, sondern nur mit dessen Dekoration, wie etwa der gleichfalls Capomaestro gennante Steinmetz Giovanni di Fetto am Dom (Loggia Die Lanzi, 1885, 104). Ich fge noch hinzu: vielleicht war mit Oratorium nicht die Kirche, sondern nur das Tabernakel des Gnadenbildes gemeint? Die Halle selbst war ja zu Orcagnas Zeiten noch nicht Oratorium, sondern Getreidenmarkt. Jedenfallas hat Klara Steinweg recht, wenn sie aus stilkritischen Grnden eine Beteiligung Orcagnas am Bau ablehnt (a. a. O. 45). Fr diese Ablehnung hat Tosi, Boll. dA. XXVII, 1934, 514 ff. inzwischen einen bndigen Beweis erbracht. (24) Neri di Fioravanti und Francesco Talenti wurden zuerst von Franceschini in Betracht gezogen (Or S. Michele, 1892, 25). Neri di Fioravanti hatte zwlf Jahre nach dem Baubeginn Beziehungen zur Bauhtte von Or San Michele; das lt sich urkundlich belegen: 1349/51 leitete er zusammen mit Benci di Cione den Neubau von S. Michele Vecchio (S. Carlo Borromeo I; vgl. Band II, 418, Anm. 5), und dieser Neubau unterstand den Vorstehern der Laudesi-Bruderschaft von Or San Michele, ja er wurde hchstwahrscheinlich von deren eigener Bauhtte nebenher mit besorgt; Benci leitete auerdem um 1366 die Errichtung der oberen Teile von Or San Michele (vgl. unten). Neri hat also wahrscheinlich und Benci sicher spter der Bauhtte von Or San Michele angehrt. Doch unterscheiden sich die Bauteile, die die beiden Meister 1340-46 im Groen Saal des BargelloPalastes ausfhrten (Paatz, Mitt. Inst. Florenz, III, 1931, 311-14), ziemlich von den Motiven von Or San Michele; die derben Formen der Wandpfeiler und des Fensters im Saal haben gar nichts mit ihnen gemeinsam, und die Gewlbekonstruktion verwendet im Saal zwar auch den Rundbogen (fr die Diagonalrippen), aber daneben noch den Spitzbogen (fr die Schildbgen). Bei dieser Lage der Dinge mchte ich die Mglichkeit in Betracht ziehen, da Neri und Benci fr Or San Michele {wie z. B. auch nachweislich fr den Dom und seinen Campanile) allenfalls als Steinmetzen oder hchstens als Baufhrer gearbeitet haben, nicht aber als Schpfer des Entwurfs. Eine sichere Entscheidung wird sich freilich erst treffen lassen, wenn der Baustil der beiden Meister, der z. Z. noch nicht individuell fabar geworden ist, besser bekannt sein wird. - ber eine Beziehung, die Or San Michele mit einem von Tone di Giovanni errichteten Teil des Bargello-Palastes verbindet, vgl. unten Anm. 71 (Schlu). Francesco Talenti wird zwar von den Urkunden nicht im Zusammenhang mit Or San Michele erwhnt; dennoch kommt er als Schpfer des Baugedankens von Or San Michele mit in Betracht. Denn er schuf die Pfeiler und Raumverhltnisse des Langhauses von S. Maria del Fiore (vgl. Band III, S. 330/31 und S. 445 f. Anm. 66 und 67), und er ging dabei von den entsprechenden Motiven von Or San Michele aus; diese berzeugung ist seit Franceschini allgemein verbreitet. Siebenhner hat es deshalb sogar gewagt, Or San Michele dem Francesco Talenti zuzuschreiben (Thieme-Becker XXXII, 1938, 415). Ob diese Meinung die Frage endgltig beantwortet, mu abgewartet werden. Gegen sie liee sich anfhren, da sich bei einem Vergleich zwischen Or San Michele und dem Dom-Langhaus auer den bereinstimmungen auch wesentliche Unterschiede ergeben: im Dom findet sich statt des Rundbogens, der in Or San Michele vorherrscht, wieder der Spitzbogen; auch sind die Proportionen der Dom-Pfeiler weniger ausgeglichen; der Dom wirkt berhaupt in jeder Beziehung weniger harmonisch und dafr dynamischer, herber und karger. Man mag diese Unterschiede aus dem zeitlichen Abstand zwischen den beiden Bauten erklren; Talentis Dom-Langhaus entstand erst seit 1357 ff., also volle zwanzig Jahre nach dem Baubeginn von Or San Michele; man knnte auch versuchen, sie durch den Hinweis begreiflich zu machen, da Talenti beim Dombau zuweilen nachweislich die Wnsche anderer Knstler und Kunstrichter zu bercksichtigen hatte (vgl. Band III, S. 449, Anm. 67, Schlu). Die Frage, ob die besagten Unterschiede ernstlich gegen die Zuschreibung von Or San Michele an Talenti ins Gewicht fallen oder nicht, wird zuverlssig erst beantwortet werden knnen, wenn es der Forschung gelingen sollte, die Persnlichkeit Talentis und die Umrisse seiner Kunst klarer herauszuarbeiten. Jacopo Talenti, den Franceschini auch in Betracht zieht (Or S. Michele 1892, 25), scheidet meines Erachtens aus, weil seine Baugedanken (vgl. unter S. Maria Novella) mit Or San Michele zwar die Grundrichtung gemeinsam haben, aber auch nicht mehr. Andrea Pisano kommt ebensowenig in Betracht: sein Anteil am Campanile von S. Maria del Fiore hat stilistisch gar nichts mit Or San Michele zu tun. (25) Urkunde bei Gaye I, 1839, 46 f. (26) Urkunde bei Gaye I, 1839, 46/47 f. - Im Jahre 1340 waren bereits zwei Pfeiler mit Tabernakeln und Statuen versehen, und ein dritter sollte gerade denselben Schmuck erhalten (Urkunde bei Frey-Vasari I, 1911, 379).

(30) Urkunde bei Gaye I, 1839, 52. - Da damal ein Ahschlu erreicht wurde, geht deutlich aus einer Urkunde vom 14. November 1358 hervor: damals wandte die Bruderschaft von Or San Michele ihre Einknfte anderen Zwecken zu, da ihr eigener Bau vollendet war (Guasti, S. Maria del Fiore, 1887, 132 f.); es wird sich dabei vermutlich um die Kirche handeln, nicht um das Gnadenbild-Tabernakel, denn dieses war 1359/60 noch in Arbeit (vgl. unter Ausstattung).

Da eines von ihnen gelegentlich der Einmauerung zur Vervollstndigung des Zyklus nachtrglich zugefgt wurde und als ein Jugendwerk des Nanni di Banco gilt, knnte man sich versucht fhlen, die Schlieung der Arkaden erst um 1400 anzusetzen. Doch scheint mir die Einsetzung von Fenstern, die 1380 erfolgte (vgl. oben), die Schlieung der Arkaden bereits vorauszusetzen. (39) Vgl. Foll.-Rastr. VI, 1795, 170 f.; vgl. auch Anm. 50.

Maria Novella SPECIAL LITERATURE Giuseppe Maria Mecatti, Notizie storiche riguardanti il capitolo esistente nel Convento dei Padri Domenicani di S. Maria Novella della citt di Firenze. Firenze 1737. P. Vincenzo Fineschi. NAME S. Maria Novella: so named in opposition to older Marian churches. S. Maria della Vigna: so named on the occasion of 1221 - apparently because of the location in the vineyards. BUILDING HISTORY S. Maria Novella is the head/main office of the Dominicans [in rel. to the Dominican Order] in Florence. Church A chapel named S. Maria Novella was first mentioned in 983 [CE], in front of the city walls in the vineyards. In the last thirty years of the 11th century, a parish church was constructed nearby with the same name and was consecrated by Bishop Rainer on October 30th, 1094 [CE] with the participation of the Cathedral chapter. Since then, the church and chapel of S. Maria Novella existed side by side. In its neighborhood a bell tower and Monastery for the Dominican Order were probably erected. These, originally the patrons, were gradually deprived of their rights in the following decades by the flourishing parish community. Barely a century after the victory of the citizens, on November 9, 1221, their parish priest had to give up in favor of the Dominicans from S. Maria Novella. The [Dominican] Order had already gained a foothold in Florence three years earlier. From Badia a Ripoli he had first moved to the Hospital of S. Pancrazio and then had made attempts to obtain the churches of S. Paolo or S. Pancrazio - in vain, since the secular clergy objected. As a result, the leader of the monks, John of Salerno, had proposed S. Maria Novella and enforced his proposal (7). The solemn investiture took place on November 8, 9 and 12, 1221, by the actual author of the change of possession, the Cardinal Legate Ugolino (7), who had obviously recognized the importance of the young order for papal politics and promoted the establishment also in other ways such as by having monastery rooms prepared. However, the church remained unchanged for the time being. Soon (1244) it was no longer sufficient to meet the needs [of the monks], as the pious began to flock to the heretical sermons of the monks, especially Peter of Verona (later Saint Peter Martyr) (8). Probably at the instigation of the newly elected, 27-year-old, highly talented Prior Aldobrandino Cavalcanti (9), the plan for a comprehensive new building was then made. In April 1246, as can be seen from a letter of indulgence issued by Pope Innocent IV, the construction was already in full swing (10). In 1250 the pope renewed the indulgence (11). At that time, the transept with the choir chapels were built, as the first main part of the womens church, which was planned in its basic features according to todays [middle 20th century CE] construction methods. It was the first monumental building in the gothic style in Florence and became the high school for the numerous places of worship that grew up in the second half of the 13th century and gave the city a completely new face. As per tradition, it is unknown who directed the construction. The findings suggest that the builders came from Cistercian circles and from the earliest Tuscan and Umbrian mendicant architects (14). The construction was carried out in the following stages: 1. Construction of the first floor of the transepts and the choir chapels, progressing from west to east; 2. Construction of the upper walls of the transept and the main choir chapels (in the eastern arm the founder, Aldobrandino Cavalcanti, found his last resting place in 1279); 3. The main choir chapel and the transept were vaulted, the entrance arcades of the country house were built, the Strozzi chapel was added; around this time the Romanesque church was demolished, which had been left for the time being for worship south of the newly rising walls (15). In all probability, this decisive step forward took place in 1279, when the Cardinal Legate Latino Frangipani, Bishop of Ostia, laid the foundation stone of the new church of the preaching monks with great solemnity in eternal memory of the reconciliation he had brought about between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines. Contrary to tradition, this message, which was written down two centuries later by Giovanni Villani, should not be interpreted on the basis of the findings of the building and the situation of the inscriptions, and on the basis of the documents (16). The building work was now promoted with great speed; the monks and the burghers clearly intended to outdo all similar churches in Italy with this work (17). In 1295, 1297 and 1298 the city government gave money for the undertaking (18). The construction of the new large square in front of the faade began as early as 1287 (19): the foundation walls of the church may therefore have already existed in their entirety at that time. In 1297 there was already one - and probably not only one - of the avelli (tombs) on the east side of the cemetery wall (20). In 1298 the first and second bays in front of the crossing (with the monks choir) were in use, in 1300/ and 1305 the 3rd and 2nd bays (counted from the faade) (21). In 1298, the Minerbetti family probably also made a donation for the construction of the eastern aisle (and perhaps other parts) (22). Soon afterwards, the nave may have been essentially completed. The faade was begun around 1300 (23). That was the most important part. The main features of the completed work were then gradually completed. A bell tower is mentioned as early as 1305, but the current one was not built until 1330 at the expense of the Dominican Archbishop Simone Saltarelli of Pisa (24). Between 1303 and 1325, the Rucellai Chapel was built in front of the eastern transept (25). Around 1350, the lower half of the faade was encrusted with marble; the donors were Turino Baldesi and Fra Minia Lapi (26). Around 1350 - 60, Mainardi Cavalcanti had the present sacristy built in the angle between the western transverse arm and the country house (27). The master builder of the bell tower, the faade and the sacristy was most likely the then head of the building lodge, Fra Jacopo Talenti da Nipozzano (d. 1362), to whom the monastery necrology attributes large parts of the church (28). On April 20, 1358, a lightning strike thru the spire and the crowning marble angel down onto the adjacent roofs; the damage was repaired in 1359 (29). In 1420, Pope Martin V celebrated the solemn final consecration of the church during a visit (30). Around 1456 ff. the extension of the faade was continued. Giovanni di Paolo Rucellai had Giovanni Bettini execute the famous Renaissance faade based on designs by Leone Battista Alberti, which covered the Gothic ground floor with a monumental order and newly incrusted the still bare upper floor (31). Completion date: 1470 (inscription). In 1462 and 1466, repairs were made to the roof and the bell tower (32). Between 1472 and 1497 construction of the Capella della Pura (in the angle between the eastern transverse arm and the nave) on behalf of the Ricasoli family (33). Around 1508, Giuliano da Sangallo extended the inner side choir on the left transept at the behest of the Gondi family; upper parts of the altar wall in 1602 (34). In 1565-72 Vasari reformed the church in the taste The victim who is able to articulate the situation of the victim has ceased to be a victim: he or she has become a threat. of the late Renaissance: the monks choir in the last two bays of the nave was removed, a row of monumental altar tabernacles was added to the side aisle walls (one tabernacle in each bay), the furnishings were rearranged (35), the large eastern side portal on the nave was walled up and a new, smaller portal was opened north of it (36). In 1575-78, Giovan Antonio Dosio extended the outer side choir on the left transept on behalf of the Gaddi family (37). In 1616, the entrance wall to the sacristy (south wall of the left transept) was given a faade by Gherardo Silvani or Fabbrizio Boschi (38). In 1778, the crumbling crabs were removed from the edges of the spire and the spire was given a Baroque finish (39). In 1838, further restoration work was carried out on the bell tower (40). In 1857-61 the church was thoroughly and rather haphazardly restored. In particular, the window sills were raised in order to replace the Vasari tabernacles with large neo-Gothic altars (41). In 1893, the bell tower, which had been altered over time, was restored to almost its original state (42). 1904 Exposure of the previously built-in choir (43). 1914 Opening of the walled-up windows of the Cappella Rucellai (44). In the same year, replacement of the weathered stones of the faade (45). 1922 Addition of the previously unfinished eastern volute to the faade (based on the pattern of the western one) (46). Cloister There is a great deal of information about the history of the monastery buildings, but it is often inconclusive. The building survey provides results that also lack the ultimate clarity. There is a complete lack of thorough stylistic-critical preliminary work, as well as precise plans and measurements. The following attempt can therefore - especially for the period before 1300 - only claim the value of a working hypothesis. In 1197, a claustrum is mentioned next to the Romanesque church (47); this probably referred to the same buildings that Cardinal Ugolino had a commission of rich patrons make makeshift in 1221 and 1222 for the purposes of the new Dominicans (48). In 1246, a comprehensive new building was begun (49). Significant news from 1250 and 1252 report on the extent of the work: according to this, the outermost limits of the present monastery complex were already reached at that time - at least through the purchase of land (50). The grandiose system of mighty cloisters framed by many adjoining buildings thus probably originated from the same time and the same circle as the church project, which was supported by the same spirit. Of course, its construction took a good hundred years. Around 1250, the lower arcade of the All Saints Chapel was apparently built at the point where the Romanesque cloister met the left transept of the newly built Gothic church (51). A little later, probably a second addition to the Romanesque system: expansion of the passage between the present sacristy and the present Spanish Chapel - probably also an attempt to give the passage between the oldest chapel and the Romanesque church a monumental form (52). Around 1270, perhaps the first beginnings of a Gothic cloister: construction of the first bay (counted from the east) of the north wing (the later chapel of SS. Filippo e Jacopo) of the current Chiostro deMorti (Chiostro Vecchio), possibly also of the entire northern cloister wing of this courtyard, roughly by demolishing the Romanesque cloister; around 1279/80, probably a continuation of this undertaking: construction of the Strozzi Chapel and the east wing below (53). This was the beginning of the system of corridors and burial chapels, which was then gradually extended further north. 1284/85 Building activity in the southern outer parts: on the later Chiostro dellInfermeria (master builder: Fra Albertino Cambi, called Mazante), in the area of the later pharmacy, on the Laudesi brotherhood building (at the main gate) and on the school of the Laudesi brotherhood located there (54). Around this time, the monastery still seems to have consisted of two separate main parts: the already renovated Chiostro Vecchio next to the transept of the new church and the farm buildings to the south (55). The completion of the church building freed up funds to create the connection between these parts, which had presumably been planned for a long time. Work began on the wing of the building to the south-north, which would later be joined by the Chiostro Grande to the west and the Chiostro Verde to the east: 1303-1308 Construction of the new chapter house, later known as the Capitolo del Nocentino; the Chiostro Grande was probably begun at the same time, although it was not effectively promoted until later (56). In the meantime, other projects were carried out, namely certain extensions to the main entrance and the Chiostro Vecchio: in 1318/19 the school and the hostel (57), in 1323 the cemetery wall (58), around 1330 probably the Strozzi-Trinciavelli chapel near the bell tower that had just been built (59). It was not until 1332/34, with the construction of the large chapel of St. Nicholas, the foundation of Dardano Acciaiuoli, that the focus returned to promoting the buildings on the Chiostro Grande (60). It was precisely at this time that the Dominicans building activities were given a new impetus by a natural event that initially seemed damaging, the flood of 1333. The reference to the destruction caused by this put the monks in a position to appeal particularly effectively to public charity (61). Finally, the Chiostro Grande was energetically continued: resumption and gradual completion of the new dormitory begun long before, which is probably to be thought of above the Capitolo del Nocentino and north of it (62); construction of the cloister arcades on behalf of Archbishop Simone deSaltarelli of Pisa (+1344), Johannes Tuccii deInfangatis (+1348) and others (63). - This work was probably already supervised by Fra Jacopo Talenti, who had been in charge of the building workshop since around 1330 (63). At that time, the Chiostro Vecchio also began to be remodeled again. 1338/1340 Establishment of a library in the north wing, probably by Jacopo Talenti, on the basis of a donation from the Baldesi (64). 1340-63 Addition of the transverse wing of the row of tomb chapels behind the two western side choirs (65). At the same time (1349-63) decoration of the north side and perhaps also the east side of the Chiostro Vecchio (66). It was at this time that building activity in the monastery reached its peak. A series of favorable circumstances had come together: the plague of 1348 had made the townspeople extremely interested in ecclesiastical undertakings and eager to make sacrifices; a highly talented prior, the famous preacher and scholar Fra Jacopo Passavanti, had managed to win over the favorable mood for his enterprise; and a capable architect, Fra Jacopo Talenti, was ready to give the planned undertakings a monumental form. In this way, the monastery project conceived a hundred years earlier took shape in a grandeur worthy of the spirit of its original inventors. The most beautiful monument to this heyday is the Chiostro Verde with its annexes, the large refectory and the new chapter house (the Spanish Chapel). - Construction began around 1344; Buonamico di Lapo Guidalotti, a wealthy friend of the prior, donated a new chapter house to the monks, the choir of which was to serve as his burial chapel. The old chapel of S. Maria Novella, the forerunner of the Romanesque church, was sacrificed for this purpose; the chapter house with the first arcades of the Chiostro Verde in front of it was completed before 1355 (67). The other sides of this cloister were completed around 1360 on behalf of other families, as was the refectory to the west of the Chiostro Verde, which was also begun around 1350 (probably as a replacement for a somewhat older building donated by Prior Michele dei Pilastri?) (67). In the same decade - around 1356 - the large north wing of the Chiostro Grande with the huge dormitory (della Cappella) extending into the Chiostro Vecchio and the library were also built (68). Fra Jacopo Talenti was most probably the director of all these buildings (69). A novitiate was built above the refectory, followed by an adjoining dormitory (on the Chiostro Grande, on the upper floor of the south wing), built between 1364-1383 at the expense of Fra Alessio Strozzi (70). This marked the end of building activity during this period. In the 15th century, a gradual expansion of existing parts followed. 1418-20 Construction of a west wing as a papal hostel for Martin V; Ghiberti and Giuliano Pesello provided competing designs for this (71). Around 1424 installation of a small cloister in front of the south front of the refectory and renovation of the infermeria by the then (1424+) prior and Dominican general Lionardo Statii Dati (72). 1434 Remodeling of the papal apartment for Eugene IV (73). Around 1500 Addition of an (unfinished) upper storey above part of the loggia of the Chiostro Grande (74). 1505 Renovation of the Chiostro della Porta: creation of the Renaissance cloister between the monastery entrance and the Chiostro Dati (75). In 1504, the papal apartment was refurbished for Leonardo da Vinci, who drew his cartoon of the Battle of Anghiari there (76), and in 1515 for Pope Leo X (77). Vasari brought about important changes in 1563 ff. on the orders of Grand Duke Cosimo I: the papal apartment was given to the nuns of the newly founded monastery della SS. Concezione and renovated for this purpose; the confraternity of S. Benedetto Bianco, which had been expelled from these rooms, was compensated by the installation of an oratory and cloister in the upper cemetery (78); the chapel wing behind the side choirs of the church was transformed into an entrance to the new monks choir in the main choir chapel (79). The beautiful staircase near the Infermeria (designed by Vasari himself?) probably dates from this period. This was followed by several smaller conversions in the 17th century (80). In 1814, the papal residence was returned to S. Maria Novella (81). A few years later, another major destruction took place. During the construction of the railroad station, some chapels at the Chiostro deMorti were demolished and the monastery garden was turned into a public square (82). Restoration work had already begun. The avelli (burial niches) in the enclosing wall of the upper cemetery, which had almost completely disappeared over time, were renewed in 1847 (83). Further, rather intrusive restorations were renewed in 1847 (83). Further, rather intrusive restorations: 1892/94, 1912, 1914, 1915/16 (84) and 1921/29 (85). The bell tower. Its original helmet was crowned with a cross flower and a figure of an angel and decorated with crabs on the edges (97). The monks choir (Tramezzo). Until 1565/72, the original monks choir in the form of a high- walled rectangle clamped between the pillars stood in the last two bays of the central nave. For more details, see Lost furnishings p. 734.The monks choir faade was adjoined on both sides by a grille in the side aisles, so that the rear part of the church, which served the monks service, was separated in its full width from the front part, the preaching church of the lay congregation.The separating barrier and the entire monks choir zone are called Tramezzo (98) in the source writings (14th-16th centuries). The side altars. Vasaris. 1565ff. erected on the side aisle walls, replaced 1857ff. To be presented like the corresponding, still preserved altar series in the nave of S. Croce. The capitals were composite (98a). The upper cemetery. Located to the east of the nave of the church (in the angle between the eastern aisle and transept); demarcated from Piazza S. Maria Novella and Via degli Avelli by an enclosing wall with avelli (burial niches); see Wood-Brown, 1902, 101f.On the northern third of this medieval cemetery, consecrated in 1323, adjacent to the Cappella della Pura, there had been a cloister, the Cortile della Pura, since the 15th/17th century, and on the rest of the site to the south, the building complex of the brotherhood of S. Benedetto Bianco since 1570ff. All these buildings were removed in 1867 (for floor plan and reconstruction, see S. Benedetto Bianco, Vol. I, 354f.), and the surrounding wall was rebuilt in neo-Gothic style. Until 1847, in place of the present neo-Gothic portal, there was a portal by Ghe-rardo Silvani (17th century; illustrated in Ricci, Cento vedute di Firenze antica, 1906, plate XCI; see also note 80). Its extensive buildings have been restored to some extent to their original state. The original purpose (or location) of the individual parts can be seen from the Building History and from the plan on p. 693. It should be emphasized that this monastery complex was probably the richest, the most complete in Florence, that it probably came closest to the ideal of a complex that took all conceivable purposes into account. There were (in addition to the usual buildings) infirmaries, a pharmacy, a school, library rooms and a hostel. The hostel; 1318/19. Located at the entrance to the monastery in Piazza S. Maria Novella. Chiostro Verde Until the construction of the cloister (around 1350), there was a garden here that belonged to the monastery, but apparently not to the cloister - above the Gothic loggia of the cloister there was later an upper, Baroque loggia with pillars and basket arches, which probably dates from the 17th century (see note 84). Chiostro deMorti Originally there was probably a Romanesque cloister, and from the mid-13th century to the mid- 14th century perhaps a Gothic cloister loggia running around all four sides (cf. note 66) - For the reconstruction of the demolished buildings to the north of the Chiostro deMorti, which are described below, see the plan on p. 693. Chapel of St. Benedict of the Tornaquinci (plan no. 18); probably built in the late 13th century - see Wood-Brown, 1902, 99. St. Pauls Chapel of the Alberti (plan no. 10). Built in the late 13th century, rebuilt in 1565, see Wood-Brown, 1902, 100, 105, 108. Brunelleschi Chapel of St. Lawrence (plan no. 11). Built soon after 1333 as the Simon Thaddeus Chapel of the Brotherhood of S. Ges Pellegrino. Rebuilt in 1565, see Wood-Brown, 1902,106,108. St. Martins Chapel of the Nelli (plan no. 12). Built before 1347, rebuilt in 1565, see Wood- Brown, 1902, 106/07, 108. Building of the Confraternity of S. Ges Pellegrino (plan no. 14). Built around 1347, located to the north opposite the last three chapels mentioned. The entrance was exactly opposite the Lrenz chapel. Behind it was a small cloister. From its north-west corner you entered a Anteroom. Behind this was the oratory (plan no. 15). Cf. Wood-Brown,1902, 107/08; the whole is depicted on the city view by Stefano Bonsignori (1584) (reproduction in Mori-Boffito,Piante e vedute di Firenze). Chapel of the Stigmata of St. Francis (patrons: Alfieri-Strinati). Built in 1363, it is located approximately at the place numbered 13 on the plan. Vgl.Wood-Brown,1902,108. Garden wing of the dormitory (?) Such a building is shown on the plan from the Baroque period (no. 21). Monastero del Capitolo. The oldest chapter house, built in 1244, was located on Via Valfonda - probably in the extreme north-east of the monastery district - where the Tertiaries of the Dominican Order - Pinzocchere di Penitenza - had built a small convent in 1308. Cf. Wood- Brown,1902,77. The dormitories at the Chiostro Grande (plan no. 29 and 30). They were originally three-aisled pillared halls, without the cell walls already shown on the plan, which were probably added in the 16th or 17th century - For the staircase (no. 28), see note 65 - On the upper floor above the west end of dormitory no. 30 is the Cappela del Papa, built in 1418-20. The Popes hostel (plan no. 31). A series of rooms that the city government had built as a hostel for distinguished guests in 1418-20, located on the upper floor of the west wing of the Chiostro Grande; accessible through the associated chapel (cf. (see previous section), also by a staircase at the south end (from the Via della Scala), allegedly also by a flight of steps built according to a design by Lorenzo Ghiberti or Giuliano Pesello in 1418-20, on the lowest post of which the citys heraldic lion, Donatellos Marzocco, sat (this flight of steps is said to have been located in the west wing of the cloister of the Chiostro Grande [?])(99). In 1434 the halls were rebuilt and columns were erected above the entrance on the Via della Scala to support a protective roof. Cf.Wood-Brown,1902, 90ff.-The flight of steps has been demolished, the inn completely disfigured by later alterations BUILDING DESCRIPTION Church Photographs of the building: Older drawings in the Uffizi (nos. 4639,4650,4657,4682,4772);cf.Ferri,Indice,1885,52.-The most accurate ground-riB: by Ferdinando Ruggieri, engraving in,,Esequie di Luigi I. cattolico Re della Spagna etc., by Niccol Marcelli Venuti, Firenze 1724.-Summary building records in Dehio-von Bezold, Kirch- liche Baukunst des Abendlandes, VIII,1901,534,539;Wood-Brown,1902; Supino, Gli albori, 1906; Paatz, Werden und Wesen der Tre-centoarchitektur in Toskana, 1937, fig.1ff. (the ground plan fig. 27 is based on Ruggieris ground plan).-fig. p.682. Type. Three-aisled Gothic pillar basilica with transept and five adjoining square choir chapels, of which the central one is twice as large as the others.- Since the terrain under the church slopes slightly from east to west, and since the older cemetery was to be preserved under the church, an artificial base had to be built under the western half of the church to compensate for this; it partly contains burial vaults (cf. Wood-Brown, 1902, 96). Outside. South-north-facing Gothic quarry stone building; most of the structure is made of house stone (Macigno), a smaller part of brick. Marble incrustation on the faade. Facade. Its structure corresponds to the basilica cross-section of the nave behind it: a lower, wider part rises up to the height of the side aisles; above its center rises the front wall of the upper aisle (with a pediment), flanked by two volutes. The lower part has two storeys, a high ground floor and an attic. All parts are richly clad in white, red and green marble. - Components from two different construction periods and styles overlap and intermingle: Gothic parts, which were created around 1350 (probably by Fra Jacopo Talenti), and Renaissance parts, which were created in 1456-70 according to a design by Leone Battista Alberti. The older parts dominate the lowest storey of the faade up to the base of the attic. The younger parts intertwine with the older ones on the ground floor; on the upper floors, only they are present. The Gothic sections have an ancient appearance, almost in the spirit of the great architects of the late Dugento and early Trecento (100). Its model could have been the faade of S. Paolo in Pistoia, a creation of Giovanni Pisanos building school from 1313; in addition, the Florentine cathedral faade by Arnolfo di Cambio probably also had an inspiring effect - the central section has been replaced by Albertis main portal. On either side of it, four narrow, high wall bays are divided by slender pilaster-like pilasters supporting four semi-circular blind arches. At the bottom of each wall bay is a pointed-arched burial niche (avello) (100a); in the two bays that lie beneath the flanking walls of the upper aisle, two slender pointed-arched portals, each with a low wimperg, open in its place. The vertical structure is intersected by a horizontal one: at the bottom, a fairly high, richly and finely profiled base; above this, the band of ornamented sarcophagus fronts of the tomb niches, interrupted by the portals; at the height of the transom points of the niche arches, profiles that cross the pilasters; above the pointed arches, a cornice that cranks over the pilasters; below the crowning blind arches, a row of capitals. On the pointed arches of the tomb niches, the wedge stones are alternately green and white; the white wall panels above the niches are patterned with green rectangles (101); two rows of these rectangles follow one another; the rectangles of the upper row end in semicircular arches at the top. The Renaissance parts: most important building photos: Laspeyres, Die Kirchen der Renaissance in Mittelitalien, 1882, XI;Stegmann-Gey-mller, Architektur der Renaissance in Toscana, IIIa, 11, 12 (102).Leone Battista Alberti attempted to extract an antique composition from the existing state of the building: he gave the already incrusted ground floor a new rhythm by installing a monumental order of three-quarter columns; he designed the remaining area above as an attic; while he thus echoed the antique triumphal arch scheme on the lower, broader part of the faade, he gave the lower part of the faade an antique triumphal arch scheme. He gave the still undecorated front of the upper arcade the shape of a temple front. However, he was unable to fulfill the Renaissance demand for axial justice, as he adopted the Gothic system in which the flanks of the upper arcade have the portal openings below them. In place of the (three?) Gothic central bays, a mighty niche-like portal opens with a pilaster-studded jamb and a round arch designed as a coffered barrel vault. Flanking it are two colossal columns set into the wall and two corresponding columns further to the left and right, directly next to the green and white (horizontally) striped corners (widened to form strong pillars). An antique entablature rests on the capitals of the columns and corner pillars and at the same time on the intervening apexes of the Gothic blind arches as the conclusion of the lowest story of the faade; above this follows the attic, a white zone with juxtaposed green striped squares, each of which has a rosette etc. in the center - similar to the decorative squares above the gallery of the baptistery; the striped corner pillars of the first floor continue at the corners. On the front wall of the upper aisle, the marble cladding forms a composition in the style of an ancient temple faade, which is depicted using the Florentine incrustation style: four pilasters (horizontally striped in green and white) divide three wall bays and support an entablature above which a pediment rises. In the middle, wider wall panel, the older, Gothic rose window (too low-set); in the gable, the sun-like Jesus emblem; on the frieze of the entablature, the name of the founder and the completion date 1470 in large Antiqua letters; the white wall panels are divided by green rectangular strips, each of which contains a green star pattern in the middle. Two volutes serve as spandrels between the front of the clerestory and the wider lower part of the faade - for the first time in the history of architecture, a motif that was to conquer the architecture of Europe from here. The shape of the volutes is inspired by the buttress volutes on Brunelleschis cathedral dome lantern; rich incrustation ornamentation on each volute, each dominated by a Gothic rose. The main portal was executed by the sculptor Gio-vanni di Bertino and his workshop; the imprese of the Rucellai family (sails) and the Medici family (ring with feather), who were closely associated with them, are attached there and to the relief and encrusted frieze under the attic as leitmotifs (103). Nave; around 1279-1310. Three-aisled basilica. Very simple structure, in striking contrast to French Gothic and in close connection with Italian-Romanesque building habits. The side aisles and the clerestory are divided into wall bays by pilaster-like buttresses, each containing a window (ogival windows in the side aisles, lancet windows in the clerestory). At the top of each nave a round-arched frieze, which is cranked over the buttresses on the side aisles (not on the central nave); lion heads as gargoyles on the crankings.The front, somewhat younger bays (after 1300) have slightly different window and frieze profiles than the last two bays in front of the transept, which are somewhat older (around 1278-1300).- On the east side in the third bay, a later (around 1300), now walled-up, magnificent side portal (103a) in the type of a richly varied round-arched pillar-pillar portal. Transept and choir chapels; around 1246-79. Basic features. The two transepts, the crossing between them and the adjoining main choir chapel are somewhat lower than the central nave of the nave; chapels of much lower height are placed in front of the transepts all around, with a strong corner pillar of rectangular base at each corner of the end walls of the transepts and the main choir chapel (104). A frieze of pointed arches on consoles runs around the transverse arms and the main choir chapel (including corner pillars) at the height of the upper wall end, above which rise the three low gables of the end walls and on the corner pillars cube-like tops with small, baroque pyramid helmets (the latter are missing on the eastern transverse arm, however w(here blind arches are attached to the cube tops instead). The three end walls of the transverse arms and the main choir chapel are the most richly structured. On all the gable slopes there are Cistercian-style brick console cornices - on the main choir chapel there are three lancet windows joined together in a group (the central one higher) with a small rose window above each lancet - also a Cistercian motif (105). The fact that all these windows are held together by a huge, pointed blind arch and connected to the corner pillars is idiosyncratic and grand (106). There is a recessed cross in the gable and a single pointed arched window (now walled up) in the east transept, with a rose window above it (107); above this is a pointed arched blind window (framed by columns) which pierces the cornice at the base of the gable (108). The choir chapels: the main choir chapel has already been described; in the rear part of each of its side walls is a lancet window, which was already walled up during construction due to a change of plan (109); to the left and right of the main choir chapel are two side choirs half the size. On their rear wall, buttresses, one between each and a slightly larger one on the exposed corner of each of the two outer side choirs; they are structured to match the corner pillars of the main choir chapel (110). A frieze crowns them, forming the upper end of the side choirs. In contrast to the corresponding but somewhat younger frieze on the main choir chapel and on the transverse arms, it is made of brick and is quite richly structured: at the bottom a German band, above it an arched frieze of columns and pointed trefoils, at the top a cornice (111). - Each side choir originally had a pointed arch window at the back; only the one immediately to the left of the main choir chapel has survived. Of the others, the walled outlines are still partially recognizable, above which a transverse rectangular lancet window now opens in each of the three chapels - ingredients of the late Renaissance and Baroque periods. In front of the two western side choirs is the low wall of a corridor that has been laid out in front. The chapel extensions. The unadorned Cappella della Pura (late 15th century) in the angle between the nave and the eastern transept; the Rucellai Chapel (around 1303/25) with three masonry lancet windows in front of the end wall of this transept. - The sacristy by Fra Jacopo Talenti (c. 1350/60) is located at a corresponding angle on the western transverse arm, surrounded by the monastery buildings; the three pointed arches of the large window in its rear wall (see p. 691 below) are framed by a semi-circular blind arch. In front of the end wall is the high Strozzi Chapel (c. 1279), in which a lancet window opens. The bell tower; 1330. It leans against the southwest corner of the western transverse arm - probably the work of Fra Jacopo Talenti. Like the other work of the master, the faade, it appears very ancient, almost Romanesque, and was probably modeled on a building from the late 13th century, the bell tower of Ognissanti. - It rises above a square base. Its corners are each reinforced with a flat template and round arch friezes grow out of these corner templates, dividing the four storeys. These storeys increase in height and openness towards the top. In the lowest, a narrow pointed arch on each side, in the second a two-part pointed arch, in the third three round arches supported by columns, in the fourth a corresponding but higher and more open group of sound openings, above which a slightly projecting round arch frieze forms a cornice. Above each side of the tower an eyelash gable, between which rises the four-sided helmet; it was renewed in 1778 (112), generally probably fairly faithful. Interior. Monumental Gothic spatial creation, the oldest in Florence, groundbreaking for the beginnings of Florentine Gothic and always inspiring for its further development, highly significant and fruitful due to its bold security. The bold certainty with which a Gothic spatial and structural system with a Tuscan character was developed from the scheme of the Burgundian Cistercian basilica is highly significant and fruitful.-Paatz, Werden und Wesen der Trecentoarchitektur in Toskana, 1937,7ff. (113), gives a detailed account of the historical significance of this development.-The individual parts of the church are discussed from the choir to the faade, in the order in which they were built. - Fixtures and additions from later periods follow at the end. Structural system. Articulated pillars (and corresponding wall pillars), pointed arches and ribbed vaults everywhere. All walls and vaults are made of lightly plastered quarry stone, all structures of gray-brown, finely worked sandstone (pietra serena). Choir chapels and transept; around 1246-79. The transept is formed by three square bays of equal size: the crossing and the two transverse arms; at the back of the crossing is the main choir chapel of equal size and design, on either side of it, half the size, with two square side choirs on each transverse arm; this scheme is taken from the Cistercian basilicas (114). In front of the side choirs there is a platform of two steps; in front of the main choir chapel, which is higher again, there is a staircase platform of five steps projecting into the crossing (115). The ground floor (c. 1246-65): the side choirs and the equally high lower parts of the main choir chapel and the transverse arms. The impression is determined by the pointed arched openings of the side choirs and the square pillars between them on the side choir end walls. At the front of each pillar is a pilaster, the capital of which is continued on the other parts of the pillar. The antique-style pilaster motif appears to have been taken from the Romanesque traditions of the older medieval Italian mendicant orders (116); however, these pilasters were perhaps intended as a support for (Cistercian-Gothic) models, which were intended to ascend to the transept vaults (perhaps planned in six parts at the time), but which were not executed in the second construction phase (117). The ribbon-like, sharply cut acan.thus capitals have a Pisan- Romanesque character (118). Corner services rise in the transept corners and at the corners of the opening of the main choir chapel articulated pillars rise up to the vault; the scheme of the latter - cruciform with corner services and half-columns on the transepts and pilaster-like designs on the triumphal arch side - is taken from Cistercian models, but developed more sturdily (119). - In each choir chapel, corner services and a cross-ribbed vault of Cistercian profiling (120). Capitals figured on the services - a Gothic motif that probably originates from the castles of Emperor Frederick II (121). The little figures perched on the capitals or clutching them are, however, entirely Italianate in style, partly in the sense of the Pisan-Romanesque school (in the side choirs on the left transept), partly in the sense of Niccol Pisano (in the side choirs on the right transept, which were apparently completed somewhat later) (122).-The All Saints Chapel of the Rucellai in front of the southern part of the end wall of the left transept is clearly one of the oldest parts; this rectangular room, which was later incorporated into the bell tower built above it, has a barrel vault and an Italian-Romanesque portal (122a); a marble wall niche in the easternmost side choir; it is divided by a small column with a jonised capital and bears two Gothic trefoil arches; Between the arches and the crowning gable slopes is a finely sculpted tympanum with a tree in relief in which birds are climbing around - a motif from the central French Gothic of Chartres (123). The arcades connecting the transept with the nave were only built in the following construction period (cf. below). The upper parts (around 1270/79). Of the previously described prefabrications, only the services in the transept corners continue upwards, but not the pilasters of the side choir entrances, the latter perhaps as a result of a change of plan at that time, which replaced the six-part transept entrances that were possibly originally planned. In each transept and in the crossing there is a square cross-ribbed vault with a Cistercian ribbed profile; in the end wall of the left transept a simple, still Romanesque-looking eye window; in the end wall of the right transept a Gothic rose window (124); the work may therefore have been promoted from left to right. On the capitals of the corner pillars at the front of the main choir chapel, softly modeled acanthus foliage, richer profiles and half-figures in the style of the Sienese pulpit by Niccol Pisano-apparently more recent, refined creations by the decorators, who also executed the vault consoles in the side choirs on the right transverse arm (125). The mouth of the nave (around 1279). In the south transept wall facing the nave, the central part, which contains the entrances to the three naves, is slightly further south than the side parts, so that two wall steps run from bottom to top immediately next to the side aisle entrances, even through the two lancet windows that open above the side aisle entrances. This inconsistency reveals a new change of plan (the second): when the construction of the nave began, the central part of the transept was apparently enlarged slightly to the south and at the same time the nave was built higher than originally intended; the capitals of the side aisles and the nave arcades are higher than the capitals of the side aisles, and the clerestory of the nave rises slightly higher than the crossing (126). The nave; 1279 to around 1310. Three naves, each with six bays of different lengths. Between the naves, which are arranged in a basilica-like arrangement, there are articulated pillars with pointed arch arcades, with corresponding wall pillars on the side aisle walls and a ribbed vault in each bay of each nave. A pointed arch window in each side aisle bay (shortened at the bottom in 1857). In each central nave bay in the clerestory on both sides an eye window. True to Italian Romanesque tradition, two parts are distinguished in the nave: 1. the lay church or lower church, which comprises the four front bays and was probably intended primarily for preaching in this Dominican building; 2. the tramezzo4 , which is two steps higher and encompasses the last two bays before the crossing; until 1565/72 it contained the monks choir in the central nave and, next to its faade, grilles that closed off the side aisles from the lay church (127). The monks choir zone (Tramezzo); around 1279-90. Executed following the upper parts of the transept after a change of plan (see above), but by the same builders. As in the transept, the pillar bases are ancient (Attic), the ribbed profiles are early Gothic. -Following on from Tuscan- Romanesque buildings, a change in the shape of the pillars distinguishes this part of the nave from the front part (128). The pair of crossing pillars corresponds to the Cistercian Early Gothic corner pillars of the main choir chapel on the rear side of the crossing. The next pair of pillars, on the other hand, is of Florentine-Romanesque design: four half-columns in front of a square core, arranged in such a way that only narrow corner edges protrude from the core between the templates, and that one template rises above the others up into the clerestory to the vault belt-this is the pillar scheme of S. Miniato and very probably also of the older, Romanesque church of S. Maria Novella, which was only demolished at the time. The next and last pair of pillars again correspond to the crossing pillars - the pillar and wall pillar capitals and their finely and richly profiled cover plates correspond stylistically to the forms in the upper part of the transept. A few capitals at the transept entrances have simpler cover plates and ancient Romanesque-Pisan motifs (dragons; medallions with half-figures); they were evidently made during the first construction phase (1246 ff.), but were not moved until long after (1279) (129). - According to Pisan-Romanesque custom, the arches of the tramezzo arcades are painted with a black and white wedge stone pattern. The central aisle bays here are transversely rectangular, the side aisle bays longitudinally rectangular - similar to some Italian Cistercian churches (130). The lay house (the lower church); c. 1290-1310. The structure here is generally the same, but all the pillars are of the same type, the Tuscan-Romanesque of the central pair of pillars in the Tramezzo, albeit somewhat modified into the mathematically abstract in accordance with the tendencies of the late 13th century. The edges between the half-columns are developed on three sides by chamfering, and the corners of the lower plinth below the bases are chamfered by downward-facing tongues. The ribbed profile corresponds to the three-sided cross-section of the pillar edges. The capitals have coarse, herbaceous acanthus foliage and unprofiled cover plates. - The bays are longer, so that their ground plan approaches a square in the central nave and an excessively elongated rectangle in the side aisles - but without regularity, so that the individual bays are of quite different lengths (131). Due to the height and width of its arcades and the slight elevation of its clerestory, the nave space appears wide, open and hall-like, almost in the sense of late Nordic Gothic. This effect was probably achieved by following the example of Tuscan-Romanesque, pseudo-basilical rooms (132), and was striven for more and more decisively, especially in the youngest part, the Laien- haus: there the merging of the different parts of the room is further enhanced by chamfering the edges of the pillars and the ribs. Again, in an almost late Gothic manner, the mighty room is given solidity by the unity of simple, large wall surfaces, it is given life by the play of forces of the calmly powerful, soaring forms of the pillars, arches and windows and by the picturesque play of the shifting lights and shadows. Nevertheless, it ultimately appears different from the late Gothic halls of Central Europe. The organic physicality of the column-like pillars is original. Urflorentine and at the same time completely Dominican in its vivid unity, the plausible logic of this strong, simple, sweeping, ascending system of members (133). The dynamics of this Romanesque type of pillar, clamped together with Gothic pointed arches in the service of Gothic vaults, are incomparable: the intimate connection with the Gothic construction gives it something urgent that allows the force of the formal energies concentrated in it to be fully felt  it is no wonder Michelangelo particularly loved and praised this church (134). Additions and extensions. They are described in the same order as the furnishings: side altars in the nave; a neo-Gothic altar tabernacle in each aisle bay, 1857/61. Chapel della Pura; around 1472ff. Situated in the angle between the nave and the right transept. Rectangular room with two spherical vaults. In the inner corner the altar of the image of grace, a marble tabernacle in the style of the tabernacle of the image of grace in the SS. Annunziata: a column and two pilasters support a vault and an ornamented ceiling; the whole is perhaps the work of Giovanni di Bertino (135). Since 1841 it has formed the northernmost bay of a neoclassical portico by Baccani running along the western wall of the chapel; on the opposite wall a corresponding portico, also built in 1841.Rucellai Chapel; between 1303 and 1325. Located in front of the end wall of the right transverse arm, above a vault; accessible via an open staircase. Irregular transverse rectangular room with a ribbed vault (136). Gondi Chapel (first side choir on the left transept); built by Giuliano da Sangallo around 1503/08 (137); the only surviving example in Florence of Giulianos late Roman-Classical style, which was so decisive for the development of the High Renaissance and Mannerism (138). Dry execution. On the altar wall, triumphal arch-like marble cladding, a large round-arched niche (138 a), flanked by two pilaster-framed narrow side bays, each containing a statue niche at the bottom, with an entablature and a circular recess above; mensa with balusters. On each of the side walls, a three-part bench on sarcophagi decorated with skulls with a three-part backrest, which is divided by acanthus-decorated armrests and columns and decorative panels standing on them (white marble frame, columns and sarcophagi in black marble, the fillings in red marble; Tuscan capitals with rosettes and egg-and-dart). - Giulianos architecture only covers the lower half of the walls. The upper part of the altar wall was covered in Baroque style in 1602 by order of Simone Gondi (139). Gaddi Chapel (second side choir on the left transept); built by Giovan Antonio Dosio 1575- 78 (140).-Ground plan, elevation, details etc. in Stegmann-Geymller, Architektur der Renaissance in Toscana, IX a, 1896, Figs. 3 and 4, Plates 4 and 6.-Main work of the classicist direction in Florentine late Mannerist architecture, unique due to the restrained richness of the decoration. In each wall there are two recessed corner columns; between them a sarcophagus below (a mensa on the altar wall) and an aedicula above. Dosio has understood how to lend a beautiful tranquillity to these Michelangelesque, densely packed motifs through tactful treatment; he has also been able to unfold the full splendour of colorful incrustation on the aedicules and the magnificent floor without somehow appearing over-rich, just as he has wonderfully sensitively harmonized the individual elements - architecture, sculpture and painting (141), space and body, surface and color.Pietra dura work and ceiling stucco based on Roman models, one of the oldest examples in Florence (142).Strozzi Chapel (at the front of the left, western transverse arm, higher than the transverse arm: above the vaults of the cloister); around 1279; longitudinal rectangular room with ribbed vaulting on corbels; a lancet window in the rear wall. Rucellai Chapel of All Saints; c. 1246 ff. - To the left of the Strozzi Chapel. VgL above p. 685.

Late, particularly interesting example of Michelangelesque architectural sculpture in the sense of Buontalenti.three-door system with bizarre individual forms. Next to the main doorway are two pilasters with a bracket covering; above them are two gnarled, diverging pediment fragments that develop out of an inverted shell; above them is a bracket-covered lunette and a pediment as the upper end of the central section. Above the lower side doors, shell volutes and box-like fields. Sacristy (in the angle between the left transverse arm and the nave); by Fra Jacopo Talenti; around 1350. Longitudinally rectangular room with pointed ribbed vault on (neo-Gothic?) corner consoles (144); in the south wall a large, tripartite Gothic window of the type of the window in the main choir chapel: the central pointed arch rises higher than the two lateral ones, above each of which an eye is attached. Upper Cemetery This is the name given to the walled area between the nave, the right transverse arm, Piazza S. Maria Novella and Via degli Avelli in memory of its medieval purpose; its south and east walls facing the square and the street are clad in white and green marble. The series of burial niches (avelli) that decorates the lowest part of the adjacent church faade continues here: at the bottom a finely profiled plinth, above which the sarcophagi are placed side by side (ornamented at the front), above each sarcophagus a niche consisting of two low pillars and a pointed arch with white and green wedge stones, above which a low wall and a white and green horizontal stripe.This avello system is also repeated on the inside of the enclosing wall and on the eastern flank of the church longhouse around the cemetery. Next to the church faade and the della Pura chapel there is a higher arch as a portal - the whole was almost completely renovated in 1847 and 1861 ff, but probably more or less faithful to the remains of the original state (145). CLOISTER Photographs of the building. Older in a of the Uffizi drawing collection (146). Newer floor plans in Wood-Brown, 1902.- Cf. also our illustration on p.693. Preliminary remark. Due to their large number, the monastic buildings can only be described in outline here, especially as many of them have been preserved in poor condition and are inaccessible. The location of the parts described can be seen from the ground plan mentioned above. The entrance. The monastery faade is located in Piazza S. Maria Novella and adjoins the church faade at a right angle to the south. It consists of a wall designed to resemble the surrounding wall of the upper cemetery, which was probably almost completely renovated around 1847/61: burial niches (avelli) and green and white marble incrustation. Directly next to the church faade a small portal, further south a larger one. - Behind the wall is an unadorned rectangular forecourt. Behind the adjoining western wing of the Chiostro della Porta. Rectangular cloister, 5 x 5 round-arched Ionic column arcades in sober High Renaissance forms. Due to its location, it can be tentatively identified with the Chiostro della Porta, which is said to have been built in 1505. - If you turn back to the forecourt from here, a passageway along the western flank of the church leads first to the Chiostro Verde (see below) and from its northern side to the Chiostro Vecchio. Chiostro Vecchio or Chiostro dei Morti. Originally the monks cemetery; the oldest part of the monastery, built on the site of Romanesque buildings in the later 13th and 14th centuries. The layout is due to the Romanesque buildings that have disappeared. The entrance from the Chiostro Verde is a vaulted corridor between the church sacristy, where the Romanesque church once ended, and the Spanish Chapel, where the pre-Romanesque chapel once stood. Wide, flat, arched ribbed vaults on wall consoles decorated with foliage; around 1279 (147). - In the right (eastern) wall remains of older buildings: at the entrance masonry from the Romanesque church (148); at the far (northern) end under the All Saints Chapel attached to the church a walled pointed arch from a formerly open pillar arbor (the substructure of the chapel; soon after 1246); an associated second arch is in the chapel wall to the right of the aisle at an angle to the right (149). - The Strozzi-Trinciavelli Chapel (c. 1330) at the left end of the aisle; it lies at an angle between the main room and the choir of the Spanish Chapel and opens with a pointed arch to the aisle and another pointed arch to the Chiostro dei Morti; the arches rest on a free-standing corner pillar; according to tradition, this chapel was already present before the Spanish Chapel was built, and its ancient profiles also speak for this. The cemetery; around 1280/90. Behind the Strozzi-Trinciavelli chapel, the passage continues under the other Strozzi chapel in front of the transept (150). To the left, it opens like a cloister towards the cemetery with segmental arches on sturdy octagonal pillars standing on a low wall (151); to the right, it is accompanied by a row of chapels, most of which are also located under the last-mentioned Strozzi chapel and lean against the front wall of the transept with their rear sides. They contain ribbed vaults (partly round-arched, partly ogee-arched) and now only open towards the cloister (with one arch each), but originally also opened to the side (also with arches), so that the row of chapels must have acted like a second nave of the cloister. At the end of each partition wall between two chapels there is a slender octagonal pillar as a remnant of this system. The corridor with the row of chapels now runs into a wall in the north The aisle with the row of chapels now ends at a wall in the north, but continued there in the past (152), with a Renaissance loggia with Tuscan columns above its Gothic ground floor. - On the north side of the cemetery there is a building that shows hardly any traces of its original state; in its south-east corner there is a capital of the type of the entrance con-soles, further west a corresponding capital, and above both (connecting them) a walled arch: here a Gothic chapel apparently originally opened; perhaps there were once other chapels adjoining it - on the west side of the cemetery a modernized building. - On the south side is the wall of the Spanish Chapel. Between it and the west wing is an intermediate building with an ancient cornice - perhaps the remains of a monastery built here before the Spanish Chapel. To the east, next to the choir of the Spanish Chapel, is the Strozzi-Trinciavelli Chapel already described; above it are the western parts of the Stanza dei Beati, a room accessible from the transept of the church. To the south of the entrance to the Chiostro Vecchio is the Chiostro Verde. Chiostro Verde So called because of its gray-green in gray-green frescoes, built around 1350-60, probably by Fra Jacopo Talenti. The most beautiful Gothic cloister in the whole of Florence - one of the most perfect embodiments of the Italian Trecento architectural ideal thanks to the harmony of its space and forms. - Square in plan. On each side, five round arches open on eight-second pillars resting on a small wall (153); the central arch on each side is a segmental arch, i.e. wider, and the small wall is interrupted underneath it; in this way, four central openings are created, emphasized architecturally, which allow passage from the loggia to the garden in the middle; in the loggia, the bays are square, the ribbed vaults are round and octagonal; the spatial proportions are unusually balanced. The single-piece forms are also structured with exquisite sensitivity: on the pillars, delicately profiled plinths and strong leaf capitals (154), on the bows, a painted black and white wedge stone pattern (renewed in the 19th century) and painted zigzag bands on the ribs of the vault. The following buildings frame the cloister: The Spanish Chapel (on the north side). So called since about 1540, when Duchess Eleonora of Toledo assigned it to the Spaniards in Florence as a national chapel (155); originally the main room served as a chapter house, the choir chapel as the family and burial chapel of Buonamico di Lapo Guidalotti (156). The whole is probably the work of Fra Jacopo Talenti (157). In the faade, a portal opens (as is usually the case with Gothic chapter houses) between two two-part cloverleaf arched windows with seven- pane tracery; the portal and windows are unusually richly and delicately ornamented (158). Behind it is the transverse rectangular main room, covered by a huge round-arched ribbed vault rising from four low five-sided corner pillars.All the parts of the room, the walls and the system of members seem to merge imperceptibly into one another to form a softly modeled whole; this is the most perfect fulfillment of the architectural ideal that the Dominican builders of S. Maria Novella had first striven for in the nave of the church, and a top achievement in the interior design of the entire Italian Trecento (159). The chancel chapel was structured in line with the main room, but was altered somewhat in the late 16th century, when the entrance arch in particular was removed. The south wing. It now contains the monks apartment and is inaccessible (160). The Capitolo del Nocentino and the refectory. Together they form the west wing of the cloister. The Capitolo is located in the northern end of this wing; it was built in 1303-08 and is a rectangular, almost square room with a round-arched ribbed vault on four five-sided corner pillars (161). The large rectangular hall with round-arched ribbed vaults on the corner and wall pillars; it was built in 1350-60, probably by Fra Jacopo Talenti. Its structure is based on that of the neighboring Capitolo del Nocentino and differs from it only in the richer profiling of the capitals. The tree effect is simple and powerful (162). Chiostro Dati So named after the famous Dominican order general and prior of S. Mara Novella Lionardo Dati, who inscribed himself next to the scroll consoles as the founder (Leonardus generalis). Situated to the south in front of the southern end wall of the refectory just described, built around One of the earliest and most ornamental architectural monuments of the nascent early Renaissance: cloister with all-round slender round-arched columned arcades, ribless cross vaults and still somewhat Gothically stylized, loosely composed acanthus capitals (column bases and portals largely renewed). In the south wing, a broad, finely sculptured Gothic wall fountain faade. Chiostro Grande Huge cloister, the largest in medieval Florence; located to the west of the Chiostro Verde, accessible through a passage from its northwest corner. Built around 1303/40, it now belongs to the Scuola sottufficiale Carabinieri. The loggia is modeled on the (older) Chiostro Vecchio: octagonal arcades with octagonal pillars on pedestals, octagonal ribbed vaults. However, the pillars are slender like columns, making the cloister appear more delicate and transparent (163). Above the north wing and the adjoining north half of the east wing of the gothic loggia rises a disproportionately high upper loggia with Tuscan columns and round arches - an addition from the second half of the 15th century. The framing arcade, which encloses the cloister on all four sides, is largely inaccessible. In the southern half of the east wing there are two rooms already described, the refectory and the Capitolo del Nocentino. Separated from them by the passage leading from the Chostro Verde, in the northern half of the east wing on the ground floor is a large Gothic hall (c. 1333 f.) with three naves, two rows of columns and ribbed vaults. On the upper floor of the east wing there used to be a large dormitory, which has now been largely consumed by more recent additions; on the ground floor of the north wing there is a second dormitory (164), a large Gothic hall of the same type as the hall in the northern half of the east wing; it is now disfigured by more recent additions. Before the profanation, the following rooms were located above it (following one another from east to west): the large library hall, extended in 1629 by Matteo Nigetti and provided with a rich portal; two reading rooms; a dormitory; the Cappella del Papa, which belonged to the adjoining papal apartment (165); the chapel is still preserved, the other rooms have probably been disfigured by alterations. The entire west wing was occupied from 1419 by the guest house, which was used for popes, princes and other distinguished guests of the monastery and the Florentine government and was incorporated into the SS Concezione nunnery in 1563/92 and rebuilt for this purpose (166); only a few pointed arch windows in the east wall have been preserved from the old forms; the interior is inaccessible. The south wing now contains the Museo del Risorgimento; on its ground floor are the simple, somewhat restored rooms of the former Infermeria, the infirmary (extended in 1428?), and a rich portal by Matteo Nigetti, 1612, which once belonged to the monastery pharmacy (167). A beautiful staircase leads to the upper floor, allegedly by Giorgio Vasari, around 1560 (168). The upper floor originally housed the novices dormitory; it was later divided into smaller rooms. One of them, facing only the cloister, has been decorated with stucco since the 18th century. Stairs and stucco decorations. To the west of the last room is the former St. Nicholas Chapel of the Acciaiuoli from which the outside of the wall in this room is decorated with an arched frieze and a rich Gothic two-part window. The chapel was built in 1332 and is inaccessible today; it probably has the shape of a rectangular hall. It has a sacristy, which can be reached from the Museo del Risorgimento through a courtyard (Chiostro dellInfermeria). The chapel originally served as an oratory for the infirmary and was later incorporated into the buildings of the monastery pharmacy. FACILITIES The church and monastery of S. Maria Novella, with their richly decorated interior, are among the most important artistic monuments in Florence. The monastery, with its picturesque sequence of richly decorated larger and smaller courtyards, chapels and other buildings, gives an impressive impression of the intellectual and artistic intensity of the Florentine Trecento and early Renaissance in general, and of Dominicanism in particular, in its seclusion and tranquility. A historical overview of the decoration of the church and monastery during the 15th and early 16th centuries can be found in Wackernagel, Lebensraum, 1938, 43 ff. CHURCH Exteriors. Facade. Frescoes in the arched panels of the three portals; in the middle St. Thomas Aquinas kneeling before the crucifix, in the background the Corpus Christi procession arriving in front of S. Maria Novella, the center of the celebrations; inscribed by Ulisse Ciocchi, dated 1616; on the left Aaron with manna; on the right Melchizedek with loaves (Old Testament parallels to the Sacrifice of the Mass), by the same painter, completed in 1618 (169). On the left (next to the frame pilasters) astronomical instruments.1572/74, on the right sundial (horologium), inscription dated 1572 (170). Interior The best of the churchs original furnishings have been preserved, in particular frescoes and tombstones from the 13th century. A series of altarpieces of the Mannerist school in the side aisles owe their creation to the Wasari Reform of 1565/72, which was commissioned by Grand Duke Cosimo I to remove the monks choir and systematize the formerly forced arrangement of the side aisle furnishings, and the associated stone tabernacles were replaced by neo-Gothic ones in 1861. At the same time, for the sake of greater uniformity, the tombstones in the floor were arranged in two rows, the windows were decorated with stained glass by the leading architect Enrico Romoli and the painter Giuseppe Fattori and neo-Gothic blind doors were set into the side aisle walls as frames for confessionals (171). Facade wall. At the top center rose window with stained glass, Coronation of Mary, framed by praising angels; perhaps executed by monks from Ognissanti according to designs by Andrea Bonaiuti da Firenze, mm 1365 (172).

Lost Features The pre-Romanesque Chapel (before 983, demolished around 1350, see page 672) Features unknown. Perhaps attached to it were the two stone reliefs depicting Madonnas, which are now located in the passage between the Chiostro Verde to the Chiostro dei Morti (see page 723f and note 322).  A painted crucifix has also been associated with the chapel (373). The Romanesque Church (completed in 1094, demolished around 1279; see page 673) Upper altar (High altar?) , consecrated in 1094 to the Madonna and St. Agatha (see note 89). Features unknown (perhaps a Madonna painting, in which the Madonna offers a representation of the old Madonna seal of S. Maria Novella) (374). Side altar (in the crypt?), consecrated in 1094 to St. Stephen and Martin (see note 89). Features unknown. Tomb of the blessed Johannes von Salerno ( 1242), the founder of the Dominican establishment of S. Maria Novella; most likely a wall tomb with sculpture and fresco painting erected soon after his death; taken over to the current church during the demolition of the old church or newly built there; replaced by the current tomb of Vincenzo Danti in 1571; lost (375). Frescoes in underground rooms (?) (376); lost. Whether there were choir screens is not discernible (see note 91); and whether a painted crucifix was mounted on them must also remain undecided (see note 373). No information is available about the features of any side buildings. They were probably rather unremarkable (see page 673). The Current Church Exterior. Upper nave. In the arches of the pointed arch friezes fresco paintings , there are medallions with half-figures of saints (traces are preserved on the west side). East side. Next to the small church portal added by Vasari, a fresco of Madonna adored by St. Therese, by Gaspero Martellini, first half of the 19th century (377); lost.  On the other (?) side of this door, a burial niche (Avello) with a fresco of St. Zenobius and St. Giovanni Gualberto praying to the crucifix, 14th century. (378); lost. Interior. In general. The characterization of the condition before the interventions of the 16th and 19th centuries in Wackernagel, Lebensraum, 1938, 56f.  The original features were dominated by large cycles of frescoes and the powerful monastic choir, which grew together with the architecture in the last two bays before the crossing. In addition to the frescoes, one must also imagine the multitude of diverse altars in casual sequence, the organs, crucifixes, miraculous images and tombs to get an idea of the variety of features as they had developed over the course of three centuries. The fresco decoration originally covered much larger portions of the wall surface. The interior is said to have been fully painted (379), but probably not according to a uniform plan; this is contradicted by the variety in subjects painted and times of origins depicted. Apparently, the painting was carried out under the initiative of individual families. Notably, the paintings mainly extended to the areas where family altars stood. All choir chapels were painted throughout, but perhaps not the Cavalcanti Chapel (Sacristy); also, many of the wall surfaces in the side aisles and the facade well (380). Whether and where the cycle of frescoes with Old Testament scenes, donated by Turino del f Baldese in 1348, was carried out, cannot be determined (see note 379). The frescoes were largely destroyed during the renovations of 1565 onwards. Vasari erected stone tabernacles in the two side aisles around 1565, composing an arrangement for altar pictures; they were replaced after 1861 by the current neo-Gothic ones (381). The older floor , donated and possibly also made by Fra Minia Lapi (1321-76 in the monastery), was replaced following 1861 (382). In it, arranged irregularly, is a large number of tomb slabs ; in 1861, they were newly laid out in the current regular arrangement (383). Facade wall.

GERMAN P1 (p663 - Vol. 3) S. MARIA NOVELLA (Deutsch) Piazza S. Maria Novella SPECIAL LITERATURE Giuseppe Maria Mecatti, Notizie storiche riguardanti il capitolo esistente nel Convento dei Padri Domenicani di S. Maria Novella della citt di Firenze. Firenze 1737. P. Vincenzo Fineschi NAME S. Maria Novella: so gennant im Gegensatz zu lteren Marienkirchen (1). S. Maria della Vigna : so gennant gegentlich vor 1221 - offenbar wegen der Lage in Weingrten. BAUGESCHICHTE S. Maria Novella ist die Hauptniederlassung der Dominikaner in Florenz. P2 (p. 664 - Vol. 3) KIRCHE Eine Kapelle S. Maria Novella wird zuerst 983 erwhnt (2), und zwar vor den damaligen Stadtmauern in Weingrten. / Im letzen Drittel des 11. Jahrhunderts wurde neben ihr eine Pfarrkirche gleichen Namens errichtet und am 30. Oktober 1094 von Bischof Rainer unter Mitwirkung des Domkapitels geweiht (3). Seitdem bestanden Kirche und Kapelle von S. Maria Novella nebeneinander fort (4). In ihrer Nachbarschaft erhob sich wahrscheinlich ein Glockenturm und ein kleines Kloster fr die Dom-Kanoniker (5). Diese, ursprnglich die Patronatsherren, wurden in dem folgenden Jahrzehnten von der aufblhenden Pfarrgemeinde allmhlich um ihre Rechte gebracht (6). / Kaum ein Menschenalter nach dem Obsiegen der Brger, am 9. November 1221, mute ihr Pfarrer freilich zugunsten der Dominikaner aud S. Maria Novella verzichten. Der Orden hatte schon drei Jahre zuvor in Florenz Fu gefat. Von der Badia a Ripoli war er zunchst ins Hospital von S. Pancrazio bergesiedelt und hatte dann Versuche gemacht, die Kirchen S. Paolo oder S. Pancrazio zu erhalten - vergeblich, da die Weltgeistlichkeit widersprach. Daraufhin hatte der Fhrer der Mnche, Johann von Salerno, S. Maria Novella in Vorschlag gebracht und seinen Vorschlag durchgesetzt (7). Die feierliche Einsetzung geschah am 8., 9. Und 12. November 1221, und zwar durch den eigentlichen Urheber des Besitzwechsels, den Kardinallegaten Ugolino (7), der offenbar die Bedeutung des jungen Ordens fr die ppstliche Politik erkannt hatte und die Niederlassung auch sonst frderte, indem er Klosterrum herrichten lie. Die Kirche blieb aber einstweilen unverndert. Bald (1244) gengte sie denn auch dem Bedrfnissen nicht mehr, da die Frommen den ketzerfeindlichen Predigten der Mnche, vor allem des Petrus von Verona (des spteren Heiligen Petrus Martyr), in immer greren Scharen zuzustrmen begannen (8). Wohl auf Betreiben des neugewhlten, 27jhrigen, hochbegabten Priors Aldobrandino Cavalcanti (9) wurde daraufhin der Plan zu einem umfassenden Neubau gefat. Im April 1246 war, wie aus einer- P3 (665 - Vol. 3) Ablaverschreibung Papst Innozenz IV. hervorgeht, der Bau bereits in vollem Gang (10). 1250 erneuerte der Pabst den Abla (11). Damals entstand das Querschiff mit den Chorkapellen, als erster Hauptteil einer Frauenkirche, die in ihren Grundzgen dem heutigen Bau entsprechend geplant war. Sie war der erste Monumentalbau gotischen Stiles in Florenz und wurde die hohe Schule fr die zahlreichen Gotteshuser, die in der zweiten Hlfte des 13 Jahrhunderts aufwachsen und der Stadt ein vollkommen neues Gesicht gaben. Wer den Bau geleitet hat, verschweigt die berlieferung. Sicher waren es nicht die seit Vasari immer wieder dafr in Anspruch genommenen Laienbrder Fra Sisto, Fra Ristoro und Fra Giovanni da Campi (12) und ebensowenig andere, erst spter ins Kloster eingetretene Mnche (13). Der Baubefund lt vermuten, da die Baumeister aud den Kreisen der Zisterzienser und der frhesten toskanisch- umbrischen Bettelordensarchitekten stammten (14). - Die Ausfhrung vollzog sich etwa in folgenden Abschnitten: 1. Errichtung des Erdgeschosses der Queraeme und Chorkapellen, von Westen nach Osten fortschreitend; 2. Auffhrung der Obermauern des Querschiffs und der Hauptchorkapellen (im Ostarm fand der Begrnder, Aldobrandino Cavalcanti, 1279 seine letzte Ruhesttte); 3. Einbewlgung der Hauptchorkapelle und des Querhauses, Erstellung der Eingangsarkaden des Landhauses, Anfgung der Strozzi-Kapelle; um diese Zeit ri man die romanische Kirche ab, die einstweilen fr den Gottesdienst sdlich vor den neu aufwachsenden Mauern belassen worden war (15). Aller Wahrscheinlichkeit nach geschah dieser entscheidende Fortschritt im Jahr 1279. Damals legte der Kardinallegat Latino Frangipani, Bischof von Ostia, mit groer Feierlichkeit zum ewigen Gedchtnis der von ihm bewirken Vershnung zwischen den Guelfen und den Ghibellinen den Grundstein zu der neuen Kirche der Predigermnche. Diese zwei Menschenalter spter von Giovanni Villani niedergeschriebene Nachricht darf wohl, entgegen der Tradition, nicht auf Grund des Baubefundes und der Situation der Inschriften, und auf Grund der Urkunden (16). Der Bau wurde nunmehr mit groer Schnelligkeit gefrdert; die Mnche und die Brder gedachten mit diesem Werk ausgesprochenermaen alle hnlichen Kirchen Italiens zu bertrumpfen (17). 1295, 1297 und 1298 gab die Stadtregierung Geld fr das Unternehmen (18). Schon 1287 begann man, den neuen groen Platz vor der Fassade anzulegen (19): die Grundmauern der Kirche mgen also damals bereits in ihrem ganzen Umfange vorhanden gewesen sein. 1297 war schon einer  und wahrscheinlich nicht nur einer  der avelli (Grabnisehen) an der Ostseite der Friedhofsmauer vorhanden (20). 1298 war das erste und zweite Joch vor der Vierung (mit dem Mnchschor) in Benutzung genommen, 1300/02 und 1305 das 3. und 2. Joch (von der Fassade gerechnet) (21). 1298 hat auch wahrscheinlich die Familie Minerbetti eine Stiftung zugunsten der Erbauung des stlichen Seitenschiffs (und vielleicht noch weitere Bauteile) gemacht (22). Bald darauf mag das Langhaus im wesentlichen gestanden haben. Die Fassade wurde um 1300 begonnen (23). Damit war das Wichtigste getan. Das in seinen Grundzgen vollendete Werk wurde dann ganz allmhlich vervollstndigt. Schon 1305 wird ein Glockenturm erwhnt; der heutige wurde aber erst 1330 auf Kosten des Dominikaner-Erzbischofs Simone Saltarelli von Pisa errichtet (24). Zwischen 1303 und 1325 entstand die Rucellai-Kapelle vor der stlichen Querhausstirn (25). Um 1350 wurde die untere Hlfte der Fassade mit Marmor inkrustiert; Stifter waren Turino Baldesi und Fra Minia Lapi (26). Um 1350-60 lie Mainardi Cavalcanti die heutige Sakristei im Winkel zwischen dem westlichen Querarm und dem Landhaus errichten (27). Baumeister des Glockenturm, der Fassade und der Sakristei war hchstwahrscheinlich der damalige Leiter der Bauhtte, Fra Jacopo Talenti da Nipozzano ( 1362), dem der Kloster-Nekrolog groe Teile der Kirche zuschreibt (28). Am 20. April 1358 warf ein Blitzschlag den Turmhelm und den bekrnenden Marmorengel auf die angrenzenden Dcher herunter; 1359 wurde der Schaden repariert (29). 1420 zelebrierte Papst Martin V. gelegentlich eines Besuches die feierliche Schluweihe der Kirche (30). Um 1456 ff. wurde der Ausbau der Fassade fortgesetzt. Giovanni di Paolo Rucellai lie dutch Giovanni Bettini nach Entwrfen des Leone Battista Alberti die berhmte Renaissance-Fassade ausfhren, durch die das gotische Erdgescho mit einer Monumentalordnung berkleidet und das noch kahle Obergescho neu inkrustiert wurde (31). Schludatum: 1470 (Inschrift). 1462 und 1466 fanden Reparaturen am Dach und am GLockenturm statt (32). Zwischen 1472 und 1497 Errichtung der Capella della Pura (im Winkel zwischen stlichem Querarm und Langhaus) im Auftrag der Familie Ricasoli (33). Um 1508 baute Giuliano da Sangallo den inneren Nebenchor am linken Querarm im Auftrug der Familie Gondi aus; obere Teile der Altarwand 1602 (34). 1565 - 72 reformierte Vasari die Kirche im Geschmack der Sptrenaissance: der Mnchschor in den beiden letzten Langhausjochen wurde entfernt, eine Reihe monumentaler Altartabernakel an den Seitenschiffswnden angebracht (in jedem Joch ein Tabernakel), die Ausstattung neu angeordnet (35), das groe stliche Seitenportal am Langhaus vermauert und nrdlich daneben ein neues, kleineres Portal geffnet (36). 1575-78 baute Giovan Antonio Dosio den ueren Nebenchor am linken Querarm im Auftrug der Familie Gaddi aus (37). 1616 erhielt die Eingangswand zur Sakristei (Sdwand des linken Querarmes) eine Fassade von Gherardo Silvani oder Fabbrizio Boschi (38). 1778 entfernte man die zerfallenden Krabben von den Kanten des Turmhelmes und gab dem Helm einen barocken Abschlu (39). 1838 fanden weitere Restaurierungen am Glockenturm statt (40). 1857-61 wurde die Kirche grndlich und ziemlich willkrlich restauriert. Vor allem legte man die Sohlbnke der Fenster hher, um an Stelle der Vasari-Tabernakel groe neugotische Altre darunter anzubringen (41). 1893 wurde der im Laufe der Zeit vernderte Glockenturm wirder annhernd in seinen ursprnglichen Zustand versetzt (42). 1904 Freilegung des vorher eingebauten Chores (43). 1914 ffnung der vermauerten Fenster der Cappella Rucellai (44). Im selben Jahr Auswechslung der verwitterten Steine der Fassade (45). 1922 Hinzufgung der zuvor immer unausgefhrt gebliebenen stlichen Volute an der Fassade (nach dem Muster der westlichen) (46). KLOSTER Die Nachrichten ber die Geschichte der Klosterbaulichkeiten sind sehr reichlich, aber oft nicht eindeutig. Die Bauuntersuchung liefert Ergebnisse, die der letzten Klarheit auch ermangeln. An grndlichen stilkritischen Vorarbeiten fehlt es vllig, ebenso an genauen Plnen und Abmessungen. Der folgende Versuch kann demnach  besonders fr die Ziet vor 1300  nur den Wert einer Arbeitshypothese beanspruchen. 1197 wird ein claustrum neben der romanischen Kirche erwhnt (47); damit waren wohl dieselben Gebude gemeint, die Kardinal Ugolino 1221 und 1222 durch eine Kommission reicher Gnner fr die Zwecke der neueingezogenen Dominikaner notdrftig herrichten lie (48). 1246 wurde ein umfassender Neubau begonnen (49). ber den umfang der Arbeiten berichten bedeutsame Nachrichten von 1250 und 1252: danach wurden die uersten Grenzen der heutigen Klosteranlage bereits damals erreicht  wenigstens durch Grundstckskufe (50). Das groartige System mchtiger, von vielen Nebenbauten umrahmter Kreuzgnge entstammt als Baugedanke also wahrscheinlich derselben Zeit und demselben Kreise wie das vom gleichen Geiste getragene Kirchenprojekt. Die Ausfhrung zog sich freilich ber gut hundert Jahre hin. Um 1250 anscheinend Errichtung des Lauben-Unterbaus der Allerheiligen Kapelle an der Stelle, wo der romanische Kreuzgang an das linke Querschiff der neuaufwachsenden gotischen Kirche stie (51). Wenig spter vermutlich ein zweiter Einbau in das romanische System: Ausbau der Passage zwischen der jetzigen Sakristei und der jetzigen Spanischen Kapelle  wohl auch ein Versuch, dem Durchgang zwischen der ltesten Kapelle und der romanischen Kirche eine monumentale Form zu geben (52). Gegen 1270 vielleicht erste Anfnge eines gotischen Kreuzgangs: Errichtung des ersten (von Osten gezhlt) Joches des Nordflgels (der spteren Kapelle SS. Filippo e Jacopo) am jetzigen Chiostro deMorti (Chiostro Vecchio), mglicherweise auch des ganzen nrdlichen Kreuzgangflgels dieses Hofes, etwa unter Niederlegung des romanischen Kreuzgangs; um 1279/80 wohl Fortfhrung dieser Unternehmung: Bau der Strozzi Kapelle und des darunterliegenden Ostflgels (53). Damit war der Anfang zu dem System von Gngen und Grabkapellen gemacht, das dann allmhlich weiter nach Norden zu ausgedehnt wurde. 1284/ Bauttigkeit in den sdlichen Auenteilen: am spteren Chiostro dellInfermeria (Baumeister: Fra Albertino Cambi, genannt Mazante), in der Gegend der spteren Apotheke, am Bruderschaftsgebude der Laudesi (am Haupttor) und an der ebenda gelegenen Schule der Laudesi-Bruderschaft (54). Um diese Zeit scheint das Kloster noch aus zwei getrennten Hauptteilen bestanden zu haben: aus dem bereits naugestalteten Chiostro Vecchio neben dem Querschiff der neuen Kirche und aus den Wirtschaftsgebuden im Sden (55). Durch die Vollendung des Kirchenbaus wurden nun Mittel frei, um die vermutlich lngst geplante Verbindung zwischen diesen Teilen herzustellen. Man begann mit der Errichtung des sdnrdlich gereichteten Gebude-Flgels, an den sich dann spter der Chiostro Grande im Westen, der Chiostro Verde im Osten anlehnen sollten: 1303-1308 Erbauung des neuen Kapitelhauses, des spter so genannten Capitolo del Nocentino; gleichzeitig wurde wohl der Chiostro Grande begonnen, wirksam gefrdert freilich erst spter (56). Inzwischen wurden andere Unternehmungen durchgefhrt, und zwar gewisse Ausbauten am Haupteingang und im Chiostro Vecchio: 1318/19 die Schule und die Herberge (57), 1323 die Friedhofsmauer (58), um 1330 wohl die Kapelle Strozzi-Trinciavelli nahe dem eben damals errichteten Glockenturm (59). Erst 1332/34 wandte man sich mit der Erbauung der groen Nikolauskapelle, der Stiftung des Dardano Acciaiuoli, wieder der Frderung der Bauten am Chiostro Grande zu (60). Gerade damals bekamen die Bauunternahmungen der Dominikaner einen neuen Ansto durch ein zunchst schdlich scheinendes Naturereignis, die berschwemmung von 1333. Der Hinweis auf die dadurch angerichteten Zerstrungen versetzte die Mnche in die Lage, die ffentliche Mildttigkeit besonders wirksam anrufen zu knnen (61). Nun endlich wurde der Chiostro Grande energisch weitergefhrt: wiederaufnahme und allmhliche Vollendung des lange zuvor begonnenen neuen Dormitoriums, das wohl ber dem Capitolo del Nocentino und nrdlich daran anschlieend zu denken ist (62); Errichtung der Kreuzgang-Arkaden im Auftrag des Erzbischofs Simone deSaltarelli von Pisa (+1344), des Johannes Tuccii deInfangatis ( 1348) und anderer (63).  Diese Arbeiten leitete wohl schon Fra Jacopo Talenti, der seit etwa 1330 die Bauhtte bernommen hatte (63). Damals begann auch eine erneute Umgestaltung des Chiostro Vecchio. 1338/1340 im Nordflgel auf Grund einer Stiftung der Baldesi Einrichtung einer Bibliothek wohl durch Jacopo Talenti (64). 1340-63 Anbau des Querflgels des Grabkapellenreihe hinter den zwei westlichen Nebenchren (65). Gleichzeitig (1349-63) Ausgestaltung der Nordseite und vielleicht auch der Ostseite des Chiostro Vecchio (66). Eben damals errichte die Bauttigkeit im Kloster berhaupt ihren Hhepunkt. Eine Reihe von frdernden Unstnden war zusammengetroffen: die Pest von 1348 hatte die Brgerschaft an kirchlichen Unternehmungen beraus interessiert und opferfreudig gemacht; ein hochbegabter Prior, der berhmte Prediger und Gelehrte Fra Jacopo Passavanti, hatte die gnstige Stimmung fr seine Unternehmungslust zu gewinnen verstanden; und ein tchtiger Architekt, Fra Jacopo Talenti, stand bereit, den geplanten Unternehmungen eine monumentale Form zu geben. So gewann das hundert Jahre zuvor entworfene Klosterprojekt in einer Groartigkeit Gestalt, die der Gesinnung der ursprnglichen Erfinder wrdig war. Das schnste Denkmal dieser Bltezeit ist der Chiostro Verde mit seinen Anbauten, dem groen Refektorium und dem neuen Kapitelsaal (der Spanischen Kapelle).  Die bauten wurden um 1344 begonnen; Buonamico di Lapo Guidalotti, ein reicher Freund des Priors, stiftete den Mnchen einen neuen Kapitelsalal, dessen Chor ihm als Grabkapelle dienen sollte. Diesem Zwecke wurde die alte Kapelle S. Maria Novella, die Vorluferin der romanischen Kirche, geopfert; schon vor 1355 war das Kapitelgebude mit den davor gelegenen ersten Arkaden des Chiostro Verde fertig (67). Die anderen Seiten dieses Kreuzganges wurden im Auftrag anderer Familien gegen 1360 vollendet; ebenso das Refektorium westlich am Chiostro Verde, das gleichfalls um 1350 begonnen worden war (wohl als Ersatz fr einen etwas lteren, vom Prior Michele dei Pilastri gestifteten Bau?) (67). Im selben Jahrzehnt  um 1356  entstand auch der groe Nordflgel am Chiostro Grande mit dem riesigen, in den Chiostro Vecchio hineinreichenden Dormitorium (della Cappella) und der Bibliothek (68). Leiter aller dieser Bauten war hchstwahrscheinlich Fra Jacopo Talenti (69). ber dem Refektorium entstand ein Noviziat; daran anschlieend (am Chiostro Grande, im Obergescho des Sdflgels) ein dazugehriges Dormitorium, ausgefhrt zwischen 1364- 1383 auf Kosten des Fra Alessio Strozzi (70). Damit schlo die Bauttigkeit whrend dieser Periode. Im 15. Jahrhundert folgte ein allmhlicher Ausbau bereits vorhandener Teile. 1418- 20 Errichtung eines Westflgels als Papstherberge fr Martin V.; dafr lieferten Ghiberti und Giuliano Pesello Konkurrenzentwrfe (71). Um 1424 Einbau eines kleines Kreuzgangs vor der Sdfront des Refektoriums und Erneuerung der Infermeria durch den damaligen (1424+) Prior und Dominikanergeneral Lionardo Statii Dati (72). 1434 Umbau der Papstwohnung fr Eugen IV. (73). Gegen 1500 Aufstockung eines (unvollendeten) Obergeschosses ber einem Teil der Loggia des Chiostro Grande (74). 1505 Erneuerung des Chiostro della Porta: Entstehung des Renaissance-Kreuzgangs zwischen dem Klostereingang und dem Chiostro Dati (75). 1504 wurde die Papstwohnung fr Leonardo da Vinci hergerichtet, der dort seinen Karton der Anghiarischlacht zeichnete (76), 1515 fr Papst Leo X. (77). Wichtige Vernderungen bewirkte Vasari 1563 ff. auf Befehl Groherzog Cosimos I.: die Papstwohnung wurde den Nonnen des neugegrndeten Klosters della SS. Concezione berwiesen und dafr hergerichtet; die aus diesen Rumen vertriebene Bruderschaft S. Benedetto Bianco wurde durch Einbau eines Oratoriums und Kreuzgangs im oberen Friedhof entschdigt (78); der Kapellenflgel hinter den Nebenchren der Kirche wurde in einen Zugang zu dem neuen Mnchschor in der Hauptchorkapelle verwandelt (79). Aus dieser Zeit stammt wohl die schne Treppenanlage bei der Infermeria (von Vasari selbst entworfen?). Es folgten einige kleinere Umbauten im 17. Jahrhundert (80). 1814 kam die Papstwohnung an S. Maria Novella zurck (81). Einige Jahre spter erfolgte eine neue groe Zerstrung. Beim Bau des Bahnhofs wurden einige Kapellen am Chiostro deMorti abgerissen und der Klostergarten in einen ffentlichen Platz verwandelt (82). Die Restaurierungsarbeiten hatten schon vorher begonnen. Die im Laufe der Zeit so gut wie vollstndig verschwundenen Avelli (Grabnischen) in der Umfassungsmauer des oberen Friedhofs wurden 1847 erneuert (83). Weitere, ziemlich eingreifende Wiederwurden 1 847 erneuert (83). Weitere, ziemlich eingreifende Wiederherstellungen: 1892/94, 1912, 1914, 1915/16 (84) und 1921/29 (85). Der Glockenturm. Sein ursprnglicher Helm war mit einer Kreuz-blume und einer Engelsfigur bekrnt und an den Kanten mit Krabben besetzt (97). Der Mnchschor (Tramezzo). In den beiden letzten Jochen des Mittelschiffs erhob sich bis 1565/72 der ursprngliche Mnchschor in Gestalt eines hochummauerten, zwischen die Pfeiler eingespannten Rechtecks. Nheres siehe unter ,,Verlorene Ausstattung S.734.An die Mnchschorfassade schlo sich beiderseits in den Seitenschiffen ein Gitter an, so da der hintere, dem Mnchsgottesdienst dienende Teil der Kirche in voller Breite von dem vorderen Teil, der Predigt-kirche der Laiengemeinde, abgetrennt war.Die trennende Schranke und die gesamte Mnchschorzone heit in den Quellenschriften (14.-16.Jahrh.) ,,Tramezzo (98).

Alle diese Bauten wurden 1867 entfernt (Grundri und Rekonstruktion siehe unter S.Benedetto Bianco, Band I, 354f.), die Umfassungsmauer wurde damals neugotisch wiederhergerichtet. In ihr befand sich,an Stelle des jetzigen neugotischen Portals,bis 1847 ein Portal von Gherardo Silvani (17.Jahrhundert; abgebildet bei Ricci, Cento vedute di Firenze antica, 1906, Tafel XCI; vgl. auch Anm.80).

Bis zur Erbauung des Kreuzgangs (um 1350) befand sich hier ein Garten, der zum Kloster gehrte,aber anscheinend nicht zur Klausur.-ber der gotischen Loggia des Kreuzgangs befand sich spter eine obere,barocke Loggia mit Pfeilern und Korbbgen, die wohl aus dem 17. Jahrhundert stammte (vgl.Anm.84). Chiostro deMorti. Hier befand sich ursprnglich wahrscheinlich ein romani-scher Kreuzgang, und seit der Mitte des 13.

Ihr Aufbau entspricht dem basilikalen Querschnitt des dahinter-liegenden Langhauses: ein unterer, breiterer Teil wchst bis zur Hhe der Seitenschiffe auf; ber seiner Mitte erhebt sich die Stirnwand des Obergadens (mit einemn Giebel), flankiert von zwei Voluten. Am unteren Teil sind zwei Geschosse ausgebildet, ein hohes ErdgeschoB und eine Attika. An allen Teilen reiche Verschalung aus weiem,rotem und grnem Marmor. - In ihr berlagern und durchdringen sich Bestandteile aus zwei verschiedenen Bauzeiten und Stilepochen:gotische Teile, die um 1350 geschaffen wurden (wohl von Fra Jacopo Talenti), und Renaissance-Teile, die 1456-70 nach Entwurf von Leone Battista Alberti geschaffen wurden. Die lteren Teile be-herrschen das unterste Gescho der Fassade bis zum Ansatz der Attika. Die jngeren Teile verschrnken sich am Erdgescho mit den lteren; an den oberen Geschossen sind nur sie vorhanden. Die gotischen Teile. Ihre Gliederung wirktaltertmlich, und zwar fast noch im Sinne der groen Baumeister des spten Dugento und des frhen Trecento (100). Ihr Vorbild knnte die Fassade von S.Paolo in Pistoia gewesen sein, eine Schpfung der Bauschule des Giovanni Pisano aus dem Jahre 1313; auerdem hat wohl auch die Florentiner Domfassade des Arnolfo di Cambio anregend gewirkt.-Der Mittel.teil ist durch das Hauptportal Albertis verdrngt worden. Beiderseits davon sind je vier schmale, hohe Wandfelder abgeteilt, und zwar durch schlanke lisenenartige Pilaster, die vier halbkreisfrmige Blend-bogen tragen. In jedem Wandfeld unten eine spitzbogige Grabnische (,,avello) (100a); in den beiden Feldern, die unter den Flanken-mauern des Obergadens liegen, ffnen sich an Stelle dessen zwei schlanke spitzbogige Portale mit je einem niedrigen Wimperg. Mit der senkrechten Gliederung berkreuzt sich eine wvaagerechte: zu-unterst eine ziemlich hohe, reich und fein profilierte Basis; darber das von den Portalen unterbrochene Band der ornamentierten Sarko-phagfronten der Grabnischen; in der Hhe der Kmpferpunkte der Nischenbgen Profile, die die Pilaster berqueren; ber den Spitz-bgen ein Gesims, das sich ber die Pilaster hinwegkrpft; unter den bekrnenden Blendbgen eine Reihe von Kapitellen. An den Spitz-bgen der Grabnischen sind die Keilsteine abwechselnd grn und wei.Die weien Wandfelder ber den Nischen sind mit grnen Rechtecken gemustert (101); von diesen Rechtecken folgen zwei Reihen bereinander; die Rechtecke der oberen Reihe enden oben in Halbkreisbgen. Die Renaissance-Teile.Wichtigste Bauaufnahmen: Laspeyres, Die Kirchen der Renaissance in Mittelitalien, 1882, XI;Stegmann-Gey-mller, Architektur der Renaissance in Toscana, IIIa, 11, 12 (102).Leone Battista Alberti hat versucht, dem gegebenen Bauzustand eine antikische Komposition abzugewinnen: dem bereits inkrustierten Erdgescho gab er durch Einbau einer monumentalen ,,Ordnungvon Dreiviertel-Sulen einen neuen Rhythmus; die darber ver- bliebene Flche gestaltete er als Attika aus; whrend er so am un-teren, breiteren Teil der Fassade das antike Triumphbogenschema anklingen lie, gab er der noch undekorierten Stirn des Obergadens die Gestalt einer Tempelfront. Doch konnte er dabei die Renaissance-forderung nach Achsengerechtigkeit nicht erfllen, da er das gotische System bernahm, in dem dlie Flanken des Obergadens unter sich die Portalffnungen haben. An Stelle der (drei?) gotischen Mittelfelder ffnet sich ein mchtiges nischenartiges Portal mit pilasterbesetztem Gewnde und einem Rundbogen, der als kassettiertes Tonnengewlbe ausgestaltet ist. Daneben sind flankierend zwei kolossale Sulen in die Wand eingelassen und zwei entsprechende Sulen weiter links und rechts, unmittelbar neben den (zu starken Pfeilern verbreiterten)grn-wei (waagerecht) gestreiften Ecken. Auf den Kapitellen der Sulen und Eckpfeiler und zugleich auf den dazwischenliegenden Scheiteln der gotischen Blendbgen ruht ein antikisches Geblk als Abschlu des untersten Fassaden-Geschosses.-Darber folgt die Attika, eine weie Zone mit nebeneinandergereihten grnen Streifen-quadraten, deren jedes im Mittelpunkt eine Rosette usw.hat-hn-lich den Zierquadraten ber der Empore des Baptisteriums; an den Ecken setzen sich die gestreiften Eckpfeiler des Erdgeschosses fort.- An der Stirnwand des Obergadens bildet die Marmorverschalung eine Komposition in der Art einer antiken Tempelfassade, die mit den Mitteln des Florentiner Inkrustationsstils dargestellt ist: vier Pilaster (waagerecht grn und wei gestreift) teilen drei Wandfelder ab und tragen ein Geblk, ber dem ein Giebel aufsteigt. Im mittleren, brei- teren Wandfeld das ltere, gotische Rosenfenster (zu tief sitzend);im Giebel das sonnenartige Jesus-Emblem; am Fries des Geblks in.groBen Antiqua-Buchstaben der Name des Stifters und das Voll-endungsdatum 1470; die weien Wandfelder sind durch grne Recht-eckstreifen gegliedert, deren jeder in der Mitte ein grnes Sternmuster enthlt.- Als Zwickelfllung zwischen der Obergadenfront und dem breiteren Unterteil der Fassade dienen zwei Voluten - zum ersten- mal in der Baugeschichte, ein Motiv, das sich von hier aus die Bau-kunst Europas erobern sollte. Die Form der Voluten ist von den Strebe-Voluten an Brunelleschis Domkuppel-Laterne angeregt; auf jeder Volute reiche Inkrustationsornamente; beherrschend je eine gotisierende Rose.-Das Hauptportal wurde von dem Bildhauer Gio-vanni di Bertino und seiner Werkstatt ausgefhrt; dort und an dem reliefierten und inkrustierten Fries unter der Attika sind als Leit-motive die ,,Imprese der Stifterfamilie Rucellai (Segel) und der mit ihnen eng verbundenen Medici (Ring mit Feder) angebracht (103). Langhaus; um 1279-1310. Dreischiffig basilikal. Gliederung sehr schlicht, in aufflligem Gegen-satz zur franzsischen Gotik und in engem Anschlu an italienisch-romanische Baugewohnheiten. An den Seitenschiffen und am Ober-gaden sind den Jochn entsprechend durch lisenenartige Strebepfeiler Wandfelder abgeteilt, die je ein Fenster enthalten (an den Seiten-schiffen Spitzbogenfenster, am Obergaden Augenfenster). Oben an jedem Schiff ein Rundbogenfries, der sich an den Seitenschiffen (nicht am Mittelschiff) ber den Strebepfeilern verkrpft; an den Verkrp-fungen Lwenkpfe als Wasserspeier.-Die vorderen, etwas jngeren Joche (nach 1300) haben etwas andere Fenster-und Friesprofile als die beiden letzten Joche vor dem Querhaus,die etwas lter sind (um 1278-1300).- An der Ostseite im dritten Joch ein nachtrglich (um 1300)eingesetztes,jetzt vermauertes,prachtvolles Seitenportal(103a)im Typ eines reich variierten rundbogigen Sulen- Pfeiler-Portales. Querschiff und Chorkapellen; um 1246-79. Grundzge. Die beiden Querarme, die dazwischenliegende Vierung und die an diese sich anschlieende Hauptchorkapelle sind etwas niedriger als das Mittelschiff des Langhauses; den Querarmen sind ringsum Kapellen von sehr viel geringerer Hhe vorgelagert.An jeder Ecke der Stirnwnde der Querarme und der Hauptchorkapelle ein krftiger Eckpfeiler von rechteckigem Grundri (104). Um die Quer-arme und die Hauptchorkapelle (samt Eckpfeilern) luft in der Hhe des oberen Wandabschlusses ein Fries aus Spitzbogen auf Konsolen herum.ber ihm erheben sich die drei niedrigen Giebel der Stirn-wnde und auf den Eckpfeilern wrfelartige Aufstze mit kleinen,barocken Pyramidenhelmen (letztere fehlen aber am stlichen Quer arm, wo statt dessen an den Wrfelaufstzen Blendbogen angebracht sind). Die drei Stirnwnde der Querarme und der Hauptchorkapelle sind am reichsten gegliedert. An allen Giebelschrgen Backstein-Kon-solengesimse zisterziensischer Art.- An der Hauptchorkapelle drei zu einer Gruppe zusammengeschlossene Spitzbogenfenster (das mitt-lere hher) mit einem kleinen Rosenfenster ber jedem Spitzbogen-ebenfalls ein zisterziensisches Motiv (105).

Im Giebel ein eingetieftes Kreuz.-In der stlichen Quer-hausstirn ein einziges (jetzt zugemauertes) Spitzbogenfenster und ber ihm ein Rosenfenster (107); darber ein spitzbogiges Blend-fenster (von Sulchen gerahmt), das das Gesims am GiebelfuB durchstt (108). Die Chorkapellen.Die Hauptchorkapelle ist bereits beschrieben; im hinteren Teil ihrer Seitenwnde je ein Spitzbogenfenster, das schon whrend der Baufhrung infolge eines Planwechsels vermauert wurde (109).-Links und rechts neben der Hauptchorkapelle je zwei halb so groe Nebenchre. An ihrer Rckwand Strebepfeiler, je einer zwischen beiden und je ein etwas grerer an der freiliegenden Ecke der beiden ueren Nebenchre; sie sind den Eckpfeilern der Haupt-chorkapelle entsprechend gegliedert (110). Um sie herum krpft sich ein Fries, der den oberen Abschlu der Nebenchre bildet. Abwei-chend von dem entsprechenden, aber etwas jngeren Fries an der Hauptchorkapelle und an den Querarmen ist er in Backstein aus-gefhrt und ziemlich reich gegliedert: zuunterst ein ,,deutsches Band, darber ein Bogenfries aus Sulchen und zugespitzten Drei-pssen, zuoberst ein Gesims (111). - In jedem Nebenchor ffnete sich hinten ursprnglich ein Spitzbogenfenster; erhalten hat sich nur das unmittelbar links neben der Hauptchorkapelle. Von den brigen sind z.T. noch die vermauerten Umrisse erkennbar, ber denen sich jetzt in jeder der drei Kapellen ein querrechteckiges Stichbogen-fenster ffnet-Zutaten der Sptrenaissance- und Barockzeit.-Vor den beiden westlichen Nebenchren die niedrige Mauer eines nach.trglich vorgelegten Ganges.

Er lehnt sich an die Sdwestecke des westlichen Querarms.-Wohl ein Werk des Fra Jacopo Talenti. Gleich dem anderen Werk des Mei.sters, der Fassade, wirkt er sehr altertmlich, ja fast noch romanisch.Sein Vorbild war wohl ein Bau des spten 13. Jahrhunderts, der Glockenturm von Ognissanti. - Er erhebt sich ber quadratischem Grundri. Seine Ecken sind mit je einer flachen Vorlage verstrkt.Aus diesen Eckvorlagen wachsen Rundbogenfriese heraus, die vier Geschosse abteilen. Diese Geschosse nehmen nach oben hin an Hhe und Offenheit zu. Im untersten an jeder Seite ein schmaler Spitz-bogen, im zweiten ein zweigeteilter Spitzbogen,im dritten drei von Sulchen getragene Rundbgen, im vierten eine entsprechende, aber hhere und weiter geffnete Gruppe von Schallffnungen.Darber ein schwach vorkragender Rundbogenfries als Kranzgesims. ber jeder Turmseite ein Wimperg, dazwischen aufsteigend der vierseitige Helm;er ist 1778 erneuert worden (112),im allgemeinen wohl einiger-maBen getreu. _Innen._ Monumentale gotische Raumschpfung, die lteste in Florenz, weg-weisend fr die Anfnge der Florentiner Gotik und immer wieder anregend auch fr deren weitere Entwicklung, hochbedeutend und fruchtbar durch die khne Sicherheit, mit der aus dem Schema der burgundischen Zisterzienser-Basilikaein gotisches Raum- und Glie-dersystem von toskanischem Geprge entwickelt wurde.-Ein-gehende Darlegung der entwicklungsgeschichtlichen Bedeutung bei Paatz, Werden und Wesen der Trecentoarchitektur in Toskana, 1937,7ff. (113).-Die einzelnen Teile der Kirche werden vom Chor nach der Fassade zu besprochen, der Reihenfolge ihrer Entstehungszeiten entsprechend. - Einbauten und Anbauten aus spterer Zeit folgen am Schlu. Struktives System. Allenthalben Gliederpfeiler (und entsprechende Wandpfeiler), Spitz-bgen und Kreuzrippengewlbe. Alle Mauern und Gewlbe bestehen aus hell verputztem Bruchstein, alle Gliederungen aus grau-braunem,feinbearbeitetem Sandstein (pietra serena). Chorkapellen und Querschiff; um 1246-79. Das Querschiff bilden drei gleich groe quadratische Joche: die Vie-rung und die beiden Querarme; hinten an der Vierung die gleich groBe, gleich gestaltete Hauptchorkapelle, beiderseits von ihr,halb so gro, an jedem Querarm je zwei quadratische Nebenchre; dieses Schema ist von den Zisterzienser-Basiliken bernommen (114). Vor den Nebenchren ein Podest von zwei Stufen; vor der wiederum hher liegenden Hauptchorkapelle ein Treppenpodest von fnf in die Vierung vorspringenden Stufen (115). Das Erdgescho (um 1246 - 65): die Nebenchre und die ebenso hohen unteren Teile der Hauptchorkapelle und der Querarme. Den Ein-druck bestimmen die spitzbogigen ffnungen der Nebenchre und die zwischen ihnen stehenden quadratischen Pfeiler an den Nebenchor- Stirnwnden. An der Stirn jedes Pfeilers ein Pilaster, dessen Kapitell sich an den brigen Teilen des Pfeilers fortsetzt. Das antikisierende Pilastermotiv scheint aus dem von romanischen berlieferungen mit-bestimmten Formenschatz der lteren mittelitalienischen Bettel- ordensbaukunst bernommen zu sein (116); doch waren diese Pilaster vielleicht als Trger von (zisterziensisch-gotischen) Vorlagen gedacht, die zu den (damals vielleicht sechsteilig geplanten) Querschiffgewl.ben aufsteigen sollten, die aber in der zweiten Bauphase nicht ausge.fhrt wvorden sind (117). Die bandartigen, scharf geschnittenen Akan.thuskapitelle haben pisanisch- romanischen Charakter (118). In den Querschiffecken steigen Eckdienste und an den Ecken der ffnung der Hauptchorkapelle steigen Gliederpfeiler bis zum Gewlbe auf;das Schema der letzteren-kreuzfrmig mit Eckdiensten und Halb-sulenvorlagen an den Kreuzstirnen und pilasterartigen Vorlagen an der Triumphbogenseite-ist von zisterziensischen Vorbildern ber- nommen, aber stmmiger entwickelt (119). - In jeder Chorkapelle Eckdienste und ein Kreuzrippengewlbe von zisterziensischer Profi.lierung (120). An den Diensten figurierte Kapitelle-ein gotisches Motiv, das wahrscheinlich aus den Kastellen Kaiser Friedrichs II.stammt (121). Die Figrchen, die an den Kapitellen hocken oder sie umklammern, sind aber ganz italienisch stilisiert, und zwar z.T.im Sinne der pisanisch-romanischen Schule (in den Nebenchren am linken Querarm), z.T. im Sinne des Niccol Pisano (in den offenbar etwas spter vollendeten Nebenchren am rechten Querarm) (122).-Zu den ltesten Teilen gehrt sichtlich die Allerheilige-Kapelle der Rucellai vor dem sdlichen Teil der Stirnwand des linken Quer- armes;dieser rechteckige Raum, der spter in den darber errichte-ten Glockenturm einbezogen wurde, hat ein Tonnengewlbe und ein Portal italienisch-romanischen Geprges (122a).-Im stlichsten Ne-benchor eine marmorne Wandnische; ein Sulchen mit jonisierendem Kapitell teilt sie und trgt zwei gotische Dreipabgen; zwischen den Bgen und den bekrnenden Giebelschrgen ein fein skulpiertes Tym-panon mit einem reliefierten Baum, in dem Vgel herumklettern-ein Motiv der zentralfranzsischen Gotik von Chartres (123).-Die Arkaden,die das Querschiff mit dem Langhaus verbinden, sind erst in der folgenden Bauperiode errichtet worden (vgl. unten). Die oberen Teile (um 1270/79).Von den bisher beschriebenen Vor-lagen setzen sich nur die Dienste in den Querhausecken nach oben hin fort,nicht aber die Pilaster der Nebenchor- Eingnge,die letzteren vielleicht infolgeeines damals erfolgten Planwechsels, der an Stelle der mglicherweise ursprnglich vorgesehenen sechsteiligen Quer-armgewlbe nunmehr vierteilige Gewlbe einfhrte und deshalb keine Zwischenvorlagen zwischen den Quadratecken mehr brauchte.In jedem Querarm und in der Vierung je ein quadratisches Kreuzrippen-gewlbe mit zisterziensischem Rippenprofil.-In der Stirnwand des linken Querarms ein schlichtes, noch romanisch wirkendes Augen-fenster; in der Stirnwand des rechten Querarms ein gotisches Rosen- fenster (124); die Arbeit drfte also von links nach rechts gefrdert worden sein.- An den Kapitellen der Eckpfeiler vorn an der Haupt-chorkapelle weich modelliertes Akanthuslaub, reichere Profile und Halbfiguren im Stil der Sieneser Kanzel des Niccol Pisano-an-scheinend jngere, verfeinerte Schpfungen des Dekorateurtrupps,der auch die Gewlbekonsolen in den Nebenchren am rechten Quer-arm ausgefhrt hat (125). Die Einmndung des Langhauses (um 1279). In der sdlichen,dem Langhaus zugewendeten Querschiffswand liegt der mittlere Teil, der die Eingnge zu den drei Langhausschiffen enthlt, etwas weiter sd-lich als die seitlichen Teile, so da unmittelbar neben den Seiten- schiffseingngen zwei Wandabstufungen von unten nach oben ver-laufen,auch durch die beiden Spitzbogenfenster hindurch, die sich ber den Seitenschiffseingngen ffnen. In dieser Unstimmigkeit ver-rt sich ein neuer Planwechsel (der zweite): beim Beginn des Lang-hausbaus wurde offenbar der mittlere Teil des Querschiffs etwas nach Sden zu vergrert und zugleich das Langhaus hher angelegt, als ursprnglich beabsichtigt war; die Kapitelle der Seitenschiffe und der Mittelschiffsarkaden liegen hher als die Kapitelle der Neben-chre, und der Obergaden des Mittelschiffes steigt etwas hher auf als die Vierung (126). Das Langhaus; 1279 bis um 1310. Drei Schiffe zu je sechs Jochen von verschiedener Lnge. Zwischen den basilikal angeordneten Schiffen Gliederpfeiler mit Spitzbogen-Arkaden, an den Seitenschiffswnden entsprechende Wandpfeiler.In jedem Joch jedes Schiffs ein Kreuzrippengewlbe. In jedem Seiten-schiffsjoch ein Spitzbogenfenster (1857 unten verkrzt). In jedem Mittelschiffsjoch im Obergaden beiderseits je ein Augenfenster.-Ita-lienisch-romanischer berlieferung getreu sind im Langhaus zwei Teile unterschieden: 1. die Laienkirche oder ,,Unterkirche, die die vier vorderen Joche umfaBt und die in diesem Dominikanerbau wohl vor allem der Predigt dienen sollte; 2. der umzwei Stufen hher ge-legene,,Tramezzo4, der die beiden letzten Joche vor der Vierung um-fat; er enthielt im Mittelschiff bis 1565/72 den Mnchschor und neben dessen Fassade Gitter, durch dlie die Seitenschiffe gegen die Laienkirche abgeschlossen waren (127). Die Mnchschor-Zone (,,Tramezzo); um 1279 - 90. Ausgefhrt an-schlieend an die oberen Teile des Querhauses nach einem Plan-wechsel (vgl. oben), aber von denselben Bauleuten. Wie im Quer-schiff sind die Pfeilerbasen antikisch (attisch), die Rippenprofile zi-sterziensisch- frhgotisch. -Im AnschluB an toskanisch-romanische Bauten hebt ein Wechsel der Pfeilerformen diesen Teil des Lang-hauses von dem vorderen Teil ab (128). Das Vierungspfeilerpaar ist den an der hinteren Seite der Vierung gelegenen, zisterziensisch-frh-gotischen Eckpfeilern der Hauptchorkapelle entsprechend gebildet.Das nchste Pfeilerpaar ist dagegen florentinisch- romanisch gestaltet:vier Halbsulen vor einem quadratischen Kern, derart angeordnet,da von demn Kern nur schmale Eckkanten zwischen den Vorlagen hervortreten, und da eine Vorlage ber die anderen hinauf in den Obergaden bis zum Gewlbegurt aufsteigt-das ist das Pfeilerschema von S.Miniato und sehr wahrscheinlich auch der lteren, romani-schen,damals erst abgerissenen Kirche S.Maria Novella. Das nchste und letzte Pfeilerpaar entspricht wieder den Vierungspfeilern.-Die Pfeiler-und Wandpfeilerkapitelle und ihre fein und reich profilierten Deckplatten entsprechen stilistisch den Formen im oberen Teil des Querhauses. Schlichtere Deckplatten und altertmliche, romanisch-pisanische Motive (Drachen;Medaillons mit Halbfiguren) haben einige wenige Kapitelle an den Querschiffseingngen; offenbar wurden sie schon whrend der ersten Bauphase (1246 ff.) gearbeitet, aber erst lange nachher (1279) versetzt (129). - Den Bgen der Tramezzo-Arkaden ist nach pisanisch-romanischem Brauch ein schwarz- weies Keilsteinmuster aufgemalt.- Die Mittelschiffsjoche sind hier quer-rechteckig, die Seitenschiffsjoche lngsrechteckig - hnlich wie in manchen italienischen Zisterzienserkirchen (130). Das Laienhaus (die ,,Unterkirche); um 1290-1310. Der Aufbau ist hier im allgemeinen derselbe, doch sind alle Pfeiler gleichgebildet.Ihr Typus ist der toskanisch-romanische des mittleren Pfeilerpaares im ,,Tramezzo, freilich den Tendenzen des ausgehenden 13. Jahr-hunderts gem etwas ins Mathematisch-Abstrakte abgewandelt:die Kanten zwischen den Halbsulenvorlagen sind durch Abfasung drei-seitig entwickelt, und an der unteren Sockelplatte unter den Basen sind die Ecken durch abwrts gewandte ,,Zungen abgefast. Das Rippenprofil entspricht dem dreiseitigen Querschnitt der Pfeiler-kanten. Die Kapitelle haben grobes, krautiges Akanthuslaub und unprofilierte Deckplatten. - Die Joche sind lnger, so da sich ihr GrundriB im Mittelschiff dem Quadrat und in den Seitenschiffen einem bermig gestreckten Rechteck nhert-doch ohne Regel-mBigkeit, so da die einzelnen Joche ziemlich verschieden lang ausgetallen sind (131). Gesamtwirkung und Bedeutung. Durch die Hhe und Weite seiner Ar-kaden und durch die geringe berhhung seines Obergadens wirkt der Langhaus-Raum weit, offen und hallenartig, fast schon im Sinne der nordischen Sptgotik. Diese Wirkung ist wahrscheinlich durch Anknpfung an toskanisch-romanische, pseudobasilikale Rume zu-stande gekommen (132), und vor allem im jngsten Teil, dem ,,Laien-haus,immer entschiedener angestrebt worden: dort wird das Inein- andervergleiten der Raumteile auch noch durch Abfasung der Pfeiler-kanten und der Rippen gefrdert. Wiederum fast schon in spt-gotischer Weise erhlt der mchtige Raum Festigkeit durch die Ge-schlossenheit schlichter, groer Wandflchen, erhlt er Leben durch das Krftespiel der gelassen kraftvoll aufstrebenden Formen der Pfeiler, Bgen und Fenster und durch das malerische Spiel der ver-gleitenden Lichter und Schatten. Dennoch wirkt er letzten Endes anders als die sptgotischen Hallen Mitteleuropas. Uritalienisch die organische Krperhaftigkeit der sulenartigen Pfeilervorlagen. Urflorentinisch und zugleich vllig dominikanisch die anschauliche Geschlossenheit, die einleuchtende Logik dieses krftig-schlichten,schwungvoll aufstrebenden Gliedersystems (133). Unvergleichbardie Dynamik dieses in den Dienst gotischer Wlbungen eingespannten,mit gotischen Spitzbogen zusammengespannten romanischen Pfeilertypus durch die innige Verbindung mit der gotischen Konstruktion erhlt er etwas Drngendes, das die Wucht der in ihm zusammen.geballten Formenergien erst voll empfinden lBt-kein Wunder,daB Michelangelo diese Kirche besonders geliebt und gepriesen hat (134). Ein-und Anbauten. Sie werden in derselben Reihenfolge wie die Ausstattung beschrieben. Seitenaltre im Langhaus; in jedem Seitenschiffsjoch ein neugotisches Altartabernakel,1857/61. Kapelle,,della Pura; um 1472ff. Gelegen im Winkel zwischen dem Langhaus und dem rechten Querarm. Rechteckiger Raum mit zwei Kugelkappengewlben. In der inneren Ecke der Altar des Gnaden-bildes,ein Marmortabernakel in der Art des Gnadenbild-Tabernakels in der SS. Annunziata: eine Sule und zwei Pilaster tragen ein Ge-blk und eine ornamentierte Decke; das Ganze vielleicht ein Werk des Giovanni di Bertino (135). Seit 1841 bildet es das nrdlichste Joch eines an der westlichen Kapellenwand entlanggefhrten klassi-zistischen Sulenganges von Baccani; an der gegenberliegenden Wand ein entsprechender Sulengang, ebenfalls 1841 entstanden. Rucellai-Kapelle; zwischen 1303 und 1325. Gelegen vor der Stirn-wand des rechten Querarms, ber einem Gewlbe; zugnglich durch eine Freitreppe.UnregelmBiger querrechteckiger Raum mit Kreuz-rippengewlbe (136). Gondi-Kapelle (erster Nebenchor am linken Querarm); ausgebaut von Giuliano da Sangallo um 1503/08(137).-Einziges in Florenz erhal-tenes Beispiel des fr die Ausbildung der Hochrenaissance und des Manierismus so entscheidenden rmisch-klassischen Sptstiles Giu- lianos (138). Trockene Ausfhrung. An der Altarwand triumphbogen-artige Marmorverkleidung, eine groe Rundbogennische (138a), flankiert von zwei pilastergerahmten schmalen Seitenfeldern, die unten je eine Statuennische enthalten, darber ein Geblk und eine kreis-runde Vertiefung; Mensa mit Balustern. An den Seitenwnden je eine dreiteilige Bank auf totenkopfgeschmckten Sarkophagen mit drei-teiliger Rcklehne, die durch akanthusgeschmckte Armlehnen und daraufstehende Sulen und Zierfelder gegliedert ist (Gerst aus wei-Bem Marmor, Sulen und Sarkophage aus schwarzem, die Fllungen aus rotem Marmor; toskanische Kapitelle mit Rosetten und Eier-stab). - Giulianos Architektur bedeckt nur die untere Hlfte der Wnde. Der obere Teil der Altarwand wurde 1602 im Auftrage des Simone Gondi barock verkleidet (139). Gaddi-Kapelle (zweiter Nebenchor am linken Querarm); ausgebaut von Giovan Antonio Dosio 1575 - 78 (140).-Grundri, Aufri, De-tails usw.bei Stegmann-Geymller, Architektur der Renaissance in Toscana, IX a, 1896, Fig. 3 und 4. Tafel 4 und 6.-Hauptwerk der klassizistischen Richtung in der Florentiner sptmanieristischen Ar-chitektur, einzigartig durch den verhaltenen Reichtum der Dekora-tion. In jeder Wand zwei eingelassene Ecksulen; dazwischen unten ein Sarkophag (an der Altarwand eine Mensa) und darber eine di-kula. Dosio hat es verstanden, diesen michelangelesken, drngend zu-sammengefgten Motiven durch taktvolle Behandlung eine schne Ruhe zu geben; er hat es auch vermocht, an den dikulen und an dem prachtvollen Fuboden die ganze Pracht farbiger Inkrustierung zu entfalten, ohne irgendwie berreich zu wirken, wie er denn berhaupt die einzelnen Elemente - Architektur, Skulptur und Malerei (141),Raum und Krper, Flche und Farbe- wunderbar feinfhlig zu-sammengestimmt hat.Pietra- Dura-Arbeit und Deckenstuck nach rmischen Vorbildern, eines der ltesten Beispiele in Florenz (142). Strozzi-Kapelle (an der Stirnseite des linken, westlichen Querarms, hher gelegen als der Querarm: ber den Gewlben des Kreuzgangs);um 1279.Lngsrechteckiger Raum mit Kreuzrippengewlbe auf Kon-solen; in der Rckwand ein Spitzbogenfenster. Allerheiligen-Kapelle der Rucellai; um 1246 ff. - Links neben der Strozzi-Kapelle. VgL oben S. 685. _Fassade der Sakristei (Sdwand des linken Querarms)*. Von Gherardo Silvani oder Fabbrizio Boschi, 1616 (143).

Neben dem Hauptportal zwei Pilaster mit Bgelbelag; darber zwei knor-pelige,auseinanderstrahlend e Giebelfragmente, die sich aus einer um-gekehrten Muschel heraus entwickeln; ber ihnen eine bgelumklam-merte Lnette und als oberer Abschlu des Mittelteiles ein Giebel. ber den niedrigeren Seitentren Muschel-Voluten und kastenartige Felder. Sakristei (im Winkel zwischen linkem Querarm und Langhaus); von Fra Jacopo Talenti; um 1350. Lngsrechteckiger Raum mit spitz-bogigem Kreuzrippengewlbe auf(neugotischen?) Eckkonsolen (144).In der Sdwand ein groes, dreigeteiltes gotisches Fenster vom Ty-pus des Fensters in der Hauptchorkapelle: der mittlere Spitzbogen steigt hher auf als die beiden seitlichen, iber denen je ein Auge ange-bracht ist. OBERER FRIEDHOF So heit-in Erinnerung an seine mittelalterliche Zweckbestim-mung-das ummauerte Gelnde zwischen dem Langhaus, dem rech-ten Querarm, der Piazza S. Maria Novella und der Via degli Avelli.Seine dem Platz und der Strae zugekehrten Sd- und Ostmauern sind mit weiem und grnem Marmor verschalt. Hier setzt sich die Reihe der Grabnischen (,,avelli) fort, die den untersten Teil der be-nachbarten Kirchenfassade schmckt: zuunterst ein feinprofilierter Sockel,darber die Sarkophage nebeneinander (vorn ornamentiert),ber jedem Sarkophag eine Nische aus je zwei niedrigen Pfeilern und einem Spitzbogen mit weien und grnen Keilsteinen, darber eine niedrige Mauer und ein weier und grner Querstreifen.Dieses Avello-System wiederholt sich auch an der Innenseite der Umfassungsmauer und an der Ostflanke des Kirchen- Langhauses rings um den Friedhof herum. Neben der Kirchenfassade und der Kapelle ,,della Pura je ein hherer Bogen als Portal.-Das Ganze ist 1847 bzw.1861 ff.ziemlich vollstndig erneuert worden, aber wohl einigermaen getreu nach den berresten des ursprnglichen Zustandes (145).

Neuere Grundrisse bei Wood- Brown, 1902. - Vgl. auch unsere Abb. auf S. 693. Vorbemerkung. Die Klosterbaulichkeiten knnen hier ihrer groen Zahl wegen nur andeutend beschrieben werden, zumal viele von ihnen schlecht erhalten und unzugnglich sind. Die Lage der beschriebenen Teile geht aus dem erwhnten Grundriss hervor. Der Eingang. S. Maria Novella Die Klosterfassade liegt an der Piazza S. Maria Novella und schliet im rechten Winkel nach Sden zu an die Kirchenfassade an. Sie besteht aus einer Mauer, die der Umfassungsmauer des oberen Friedhofs entsprechend gestaltet und wohl gleich dieser um 1847/61 so gut wie vllig erneuert worden ist: Grabnischen (,,avelli) und grn, weie Marmorinkrustation. Unmittelbar neben der Kirchenfassade ein kleines Portal, weiter sdlich ein greres. - Hinter der Mauer ein schmuckloser rechteckiger Vorhof. Hinter dem darangelegenen westlichen Gebudeflgel der Chiostro della Porta. Rechteckiger Kreuzgang, 5 X 5 rundbogige jonische Sulenarkaden in nchternen Hochrenaissanceformen. Seiner Lage wegen kann er versuchsweise mit dem Chiostro della Porta, der 1505 errichtet worden sein soll, identifiziert werden. - Wendet man sich von hier zum Vorhof zurck, so gelangt man durch einen Durchgang, der an der Westflanke der Kirche entlang fhrt, zunchst in den Chiostro Verde (vgl. unten) und von dessen Nordseite aus zum. Chiostro Vecchio oder Chiostro dei Morti. Ursprnglich Friedhof der Mnche; ltester Teil des Klosters, errich-tet an Stelle romanischer Gebude im spteren 13. und 14. Jahr-hundert. Der Grundriss ist durch die verschwundenen romanischen Bauten bedingt. Der Zugang vom Chiostro Verde her ist ein gewlbter Gang zwischen der Kirchensakristei, an deren Stelle einst die romanische Kirche endete, und der Spanischen Kapelle, an deren Stelle einst die vor-romanische Kapelle stand. Breit und flach gespannte stichbogige Kreuzrippengewlbe auf laubgeschmckten Wandkonsolen; um 1279 (147).  In der rechten (stlichen) Wand Reste lterer Bauten: am Eingang Mauerwerk von der romanischen Kirche (148); am hin-teren (nrdlichen) Ende unter der an die Kirche angebauten Aller-heiligenkapelle ein vermauerter Spitzbogen von einer ehemals offenen Pfeilerlaube (dem Unterbau der Kapelle; bald nach 1246); ein zuge-hriger zweiter Bogen steckt in der rechts vom Gang rechtswinklig ab-gehenden Kapellenmauer (149).  Am linken Ende des Ganges die Strozzi-Trinciavelli-Kapelle (um 1330); sie liegt im Winkel zwischen dem Hauptraum und dem Chor der Spanischen Kapelle und ffnet sich mit einem Spitzbogen zum Gang und einem anderen Spitzbogen zum Chiostro dei Morti; die Bgen ruhen auf einem freistehenden Eckpfeiler; diese Kapelle war der berlieferung nach schon vor der Errichtung der Spanischen Kapelle vorhanden, und dafr sprechen auch ihre altertmlichen Profile. Der Friedhof; um 1280/90._ Hinter der Strozzi-Trinciavelli-Kapelle setzt sich der Gang fort, unter der anderen, dem Kirchenquerschiff vorgelagerten Strozzikapelle hindurch (150). Nach links hin ffnet er sich kreuzgangartig zum Friedhof hin mit Stichbogen auf stmmigen achteckigen Pfeilern, die auf einem niedrigen Muerchen stehen (151); rechts begleitet ihn eine Kapellenreihe. Die Kapellen liegen ebenfalls meist unter der letzterwhnten Strozzikapelle und lehnen sich mit ihrer Rckseite an die Stirnwand des Kirchenquerschiffs an. Sie ent-halten Kreuzrippengewlbe (z. T. rundbogig, z. T. stichbogig) und ffnen sich jetzt nur zum Kreuzgang hin (mit je einem Bogen), ff-neten sich aber ursprnglich auch seitlich (ebenfalls mit Bgen), sodass die Kapellenreihe wie ein zweites Schiff des Kreuzgangs gewirkt haben muss. An der Stirn jeder Trennwand zwischen je zwei Kapellen steht als berbleibsel dieses Systems je ein schlanker achteckiger Pfeiler. - Der Gang mit der Kapellenreihe luft sich jetzt im Norden an einer Mauer tot, setzte sich aber dort frher noch weiter fort (152). -Ober seinem gotischen Erdgeschoss liegt eine Renaissance-Loggia mit toskanischen Sulen. -An der Nordseite des Friedhofs steht ein Ge-bude, das kaum noch Spuren seines ursprnglichen Zustands zeigt. In seiner Sdostecke findet sich ein Kapitell von der Art der Kon-solen des Zugangs, weiter westlich ein entsprechendes Kapitell, und ber beiden (sie verbindend) ein vermauerter Stichbogen: hier ff-nete sich ursprnglich offenbar eine gotische Kapelle; vielleicht schlossen sich ehemals noch weitere Kapellen an. An der Westseite des Friedhofs ein modernisiertes Gebude. - An der Sdseite die Mauer der Spanischen Kapelle. Zwischen ihr und dem Westflgel ein Zwischengebude mit einem altertmlichen Gesims -vielleicht ber-bleibsel eines schon vor der Spanischen Kapelle hier errichteten Klo-sterteiles. stlich neben dem Chor der Spanischen Kapelle die bereits beschriebene Strozzi-Trinciavelli-Kapelle; ber ihr die Westteile der Stanza dei Beati, eines vom Querschiff der Kirche her zugnglichen Raumes. - Sdlich von dem Zugang des Chiostro Vecchio liegt der Chiostro Verde. So genannt wegen seiner graugrn in graugrn gemalten Fresken. Erbaut um 1350-60 wohl von Fra Jacopo Talenti. Schnster goti-scher Kreuzgang von ganz Florenz - durch die Harmonie seiner Raumbildung und seiner Formen eine der vollkommensten Verkr-perungen des Bauideals des italienischen Trecento. - Im Grundriss quadratisch. An jeder Seite ffnen sich fnf Rundbogen auf acht-eckigen Pfeilern, die auf einem Muerchen stehen (153). Der mittlere Bogen jeder Seite ist ein Stichbogen, spannt sich also breiter, und unter ihm ist das Muerchen unterbrochen; auf diese Weise ent-stehen vier architektonisch hervorgehobene Mittelffnungen, die den Durchgang aus der Loggia zum Garten in der Mitte gestatten. - In der Loggia sind die Joche quadratisch, die Kreuzrippengewlbe rund-bogig, die Raumverhltnisse ungewhnlich ausgeglichen. - Auch die Einzelformen sind mit erlesenem Feingefhl gegliedert: an den Pfei-lern hohe, zart profilierte Sockel und krftige Blattkapitelle (154), an den Bgen ein aufgemaltes (im 19. Jahrhundert erneuertes) schwarz-weies Keilsteinmuster, an den Gewlberippen gemalte Zickzack-bnder. - Folgende Gebude umrahmen den Kreuzgang: Die Spanische Kapelle (an der Nordseite). So genannt etwa seit 1540, seitdem sie von der Herzogin Eleonora von Toledo den Spaniern in Florenz als Nationalkapelle zugewiesen worden war (155); ur-sprnglich diente der Hauptraum als Kapitelsaal, die Chorkapelle als Familien- und Grabkapelle des Buonamico di Lapo Guidalotti (156). Das Ganze ist wahrscheinlich ein Werk des Fra Jacopo Talenti (157). - In der Fassade ffnet sich (wie meist an gotischen Kapitel-slen) ein Portal zwischen zwei zweiteiligen Kleeblattbogenfenstern mit Siebenpa-Mawerk; Portal und Fenster sind ungewhnlich reich und zierlich ornamentiert (158). Dahinter der querrechteckige Hauptraum, berdeckt von einem riesigen rundbogigen Kreuzrippengewlbe, das von vier niedrigen fnfseitigen Eckpfeilern aufsteigt. Alle Teile des Raumes, der Wandung und des Gliedersystems wirken, als ob sie unmerklich ineinander berglitten, um sich zu einem weichmo-dellierten Ganzen zu verschmelzen; das bedeutet dievollkommenste Erfllung des Bauideals, das die Dominikanerbauhtte von S. Maria Novella zuerst im Langhaus der Kirche angestrebt hatte, und eine Spitzenleistung in der Raumgestaltung des gesamten italienischen Trecento (159).  An den Eckpfeilern fein gemeielte und zierlich profilierte Akanthuskapitelle.  Die Chorkapelle war dem Hauptraum entsprechend gegliedert, ist aber im spten 16. Jahrhundert etwas verndert worden: damals wurde vor allem der Eingangsbogen abge-rundet.  Gegenber der Spanischen Kapelle liegt Der Sdflgel. Er enthlt jetzt die Wohnung der Mnche und ist unzugnglich (160). Das Capitola del Nocentino und das Refektorium. Beide zusammen bilden den Westflgel am Kreuzgang. Das Capitolo liegt im nrdlichen Ende dieses Flgels; es wurde 1303-08 erbaut und ist ein rechteckiger, fast quadratischer Raum mit einem rundbogigen Kreuz-rippengewlbe auf vier fnfseitigen Eckpfeilern (161). - Das groe Refektorium, das den Rest des Westflgels einnimmt, ist ein langer rechteckiger Saal mit rundbogigen Kreuzrippengewlben ber fnf-seitigen Eck- und Wandpfeilern; es wurde 1350-60 erbaut, wahr-scheinlich von Fra Jacopo Talenti. Seine Gliederung ist der des benachbarten Capitolo del Nocentino nachgebildet und unterscheidet sich von ihr nur durch reichere Profilierung der Kapitelle. Die Raum-wirkung ist schlicht und mchtig (162). Chiostro Dati. So genannt nach dem berhmten dominikanischen Ordensgeneral und Prior von S. Maria Novella Lionardo Dati, der sich inschriftlich neben den Gewlbekonsolen als Stifter bezeichnet hat (Leonardus gene-ralis). - Gelegen sdlich vor der sdlichen Stirnwand des eben be-schriebenen Refektoriums, erbaut um 1424. Eines der frhesten und zierlichsten Baudenkmler der werdenden Frhrenaissance: Kreuz-gang mit ringsumlaufenden schlanken rundbogigen Sulenarkaden, rippenlosen Kreuzgewlben und noch etwas gotisch stilisierten, locker komponierten Akanthuskapitellen (Sulenbasen und Portale zum grten Teil erneuert). Im Sdflgel eine breite, feinskulpierte goti-sche Wandhrunnenfassade. Chiostro Grande. Riesiger Kreuzgang, der grte im mittelalterlichen Florenz; gelegen westlich neben dem Chiostro Verde, zugnglich durch eine Passage von dessen Nordwestecke aus. Errichtet um 1303/40. Jetzt der Scuola sottufficiale Carahinieri gehrig. Die Loggia ist dem (lteren) Chiostro Vecchio nachgebildet: stichbogige Arkaden mit achteckigen Pfeilern auf Sockeln, stichbogige Kreuzrippengewlbe. Doch sind die Pfeiler sulenartig schlank; da-durch wirkt der Kreuzgang zierlicher und durchsichtiger (163). ber dem Nordflgel und der anschlieenden Nordhlfte des Ostflgels der gotischen Loggia erhebt sich eine unverhltnismaig hohe obere Loggia mit toskanischen Sulen und Rundbgen - eine Zufgung wohl aus der zweiten Hlfte des 15. Jahrhunderts. Die Rahmengebude, die den Kreuzgang auf allen vier Seiten einfassen, sind grtenteils unzugnglich. In der Sdhlfte des Ostflgels liegen zwei bereits beschriebene Rume, das Refektorium und das Capitolo del Nocentino. Getrennt von ihnen durch die Passage, die vom Chiostro Verde heranfhrt, liegt in der nrdlichen Hlfte des Ostflgels im Erdgeschoss ein groer gotischer Saal (um 1333 ff.) mit drei Schiffen, zwei Sulenreihen und Kreuzrippengewlben. Im Obergeschoss des Ostflgels lag ehemals ein groes Dormitorium, das heute wohl ziemlich von neueren Einbauten aufgezehrt ist. - Im Erd-geschoss des Nordflgels ein zweites Dormitorium (164), ein groer gotischer Saal vom Typ des Saales in der Nordhlfte des Ostflgels; er ist jetzt durch neuere Einbauten entstellt. Darber lagen vor der Profanierung folgende Rume (von Osten nach Westen aufeinander folgend): der groe Bibliothekssaal, 1629 von Matteo Nigetti ausge-baut und mit einem reichen Portal versehen; zwei Lesezimmer; ein Dormitorium; die Cappella del Papa , die zu der anschlieenden Papstwohnung gehrte (165); die Kapelle ist noch erhalten, die bri-gen Rume sind wohl durch Umbauten entstellt. - Den ganzen West-flgel nahm seit 1419 das Gstehaus ein, das fr Ppste, Frsten und andere vornehme Gste des Klosters und der Florentiner Regierung diente und 1563/92 ins Nonnenkloster SS.Concezione einbezogen und dafr umgebaut worden war (166); von alten Formen sind auen nur einige vermauerte Spitzbogenfenster in der Ostwand erhalten; Inneres unzugnglich. - Der Sdflgel enthlt jetzt das Museo del Risorgimento. In seinem Erdgeschoss die schlichten, einigermaen wieder- hergestellten Rume der ehemaligen Infermeria , der Krankenabtei-lung (1428 ausgebaut ?), und ein reiches, ehemals zur Klosterapotheke fhrendes Portal von Matteo Nigetti, 1612 (167). Zum Obergeschoss hinauf fhrt eine schne Treppe, angeblich von Giorgio Vasari, um 1560 (168). Im Obergeschoss befand sich ursprnglich das Dormito-rium der Novizen ; es ist spter in kleine Rume zerlegt worden. Einer davon, nach dem Kreuzgang zu gelegen, ist seit dem 18. Jahrhundert reich mit Sulen, Treppchen und Stuck ausgeschmckt. Dem letzten, westlichsten Raum ist im Westen die ehemalige Nikolauskapelle der Acciaiuoli vorgelagert, von der in diesem Raum die Auenseite der stlichen Flankenmauer mit einem Bogenfries und einem reichen gotischen zweiteiligen Fenster zu sehen ist; die Kapelle wurde 1332/34 errichtet und ist heute unzugnglich; sie hat wohl die Gestalt eines rechteckigen Saales. Zu ihr gehrt eine Sakristei, zu der man vom Museo del Risorgimento aus durch ein Hfchen ( Chiostro dellInfermeria ) gelangt. Die Kapelle diente ursprnglich als Oratorium der Krankenabteilung und war spter in die Baulichkeiten der Kloster-apotheke einbezogen. AUSSTATTUNG Kirche und Kloster von S. Maria Novella gehren mit ihrer mannig-faltigen Ausstattung zu den bedeutendsten Kunstdenkmlern von Florenz. Das Kloster mit seiner malerischen Folge von reich dekorierten greren und kleineren Hfen, Kapellen und sonstigen Ge-buden gibt in seiner Abgeschiedenheit und Stille einen eindrucks-vollen Begriff von der gedanklichen und knstlerischen Intensitt des Florentiner Trecento und der Frhrenaissance im allgemeinen und des Dominikanertums im besonderen. Ein historischer berblick ber die Ausschmckung von Kirche und Kloster whrend des 15. und frhen 16. Jahrhunderts findet sich bei Wackernagel, Lebensraum, 1938, 43 ff. KIRCHE Auen. Fassade. In den Bogenfeldern der drei Portale Fresken ; in der Mitte der hlg. Thomas von Aquin, vor dem Kruzifix kniend, im Hintergrund die Fronleichnamsprozession, die vor S. Maria Novella, dem Zentrum der Feierlichkeiten, anlangt; von Ulisse Ciocchi bezeichnet, 1616 datiert.

Links (neben den Rahmenpilastern) astronomische Instrumente, 1572/74, rechts Sonnenuhr (Horologium), inschriftlich datiert 1572 (170). Innen. Von der ursprnglichen Ausstattung der Kirche haben sich wesentliche Reste erhalten, insbesondere Fresken und Grabmaler des 13. bis 15. Jahrhunderts. Eine Folge von Altarbildern der manieristi-schen Schule in den Seitenschiffen verdankt ihre Entstehung der Vasarischen Reform von 1565/72, die im Auftrag von Groherzog Cosimo I. den Mnchschor entfernte und die ehemals zwanglose An-ordnung der Seitenschiffs-Ausstattung systematisierte. Die zugehri-gen Steintabernakel wurden 1861 durch neugotische ersetzt. In derselben Zeit wurden, um grerer Einheitlichkeit willen, die Grabsteine im Boden in zwei Reihen angeordnet, die Fenster mit Glas-malereien des leitenden Architekten Enrico Romoli und des Malers Giuseppe Fattori ausgestattet und neugotische Blindtren als Rah-men fr Beichtsthle in die Seitenschiffsmauern eingelassen (171). Durch diese Arbeiten ist die Gesamtwirkung leider stark beeintrch-tigt worden. Fassadenwand.

Vielleicht waren an ihr die beiden Steinreliefs mit Madonnen- Darstellungen angebracht, die sich jetzt im Durchgang vom Chiostro Verde zum Chiostro dei Morti befinden (bgl. S. 723f. Und Anm. 322).  Auch ein gemalter Kruzifix ist in Zusammenhang mit der Kapelle gebracht worden (373). Die romanische Kirche (vollendet 1094, abgerissen um 1279; vgl. S. 673) Oberer Altar (Hochaltar?) , geweiht 1094 der Madonna und der hlg. Agathe (vgl. Anm. 89). Ausstattung unbekannt (vielleicht ein Madonnenbild, von dessen Madonna das alte Madonnensiegel von S. Maria Novella eine Vorstellung gibt) (374). Nebenaltar (in der Krypta?), geweiht 1094 den Hlg. Stephan und Martin (vlg. Anm, 89). Ausstattung unbekannt. Grabmal des sel.

Fresken in unterirdischen Rumen (?) (376); verloren. Ob Chorschranken vorhanden waren, ist nichts auszumachen (vgl.

Charakterisierung des Zustandes vor den Eingriffen des 16. und 19. Jahrhunderts bei Wackernagel, Lebensraum, 1938, 56f.  Die ursprngliche Ausstattung wurde beherrscht von groen Freskenzyklen und dem mchtigen, mit der Architektur zusammen erwachsenen Mnchschor in den letzten zwei Jochen vor der Vierung. Zu den Fresken mu man sich noch die Menge der vielgestaltigen Altre in zwangloser Reihenfolge, der Orgeln, Kruzifixe, Gnadenbilder und Grabmler hinzudenken, um eine Vorstellung von der reizvollen Buntheit der Ausstattung zu bekommen, wie sie sich im Laufe dreier Jahrhunderte herausgebildet hatte. Der Freskenschmuck nahm ursprnglich viel grere Teile der Wandflche ein. Das Innere soll vollstndig ausgemalt gewesen sein (379), aber wohl nicht nach einheitlichen Plan; dem widersprechen die verschiedenen Darstellungsgegenstnde und Entstehungszeiten. Offenbar geschah die Ausmalung auf Veranlassung einzelner Familien. Sie hat sich bezeichnenderweise hauptschlich auf die Stellen erstreckt, an denen Familienaltre standen. Ausgemalt waren alle Chorkapellen, dagegen vielleicht nicht die Cavalcanti-Kapelle (Sakristei); auerdem viele der Wandflchen in den Seitenschiffen und die Fassadenwand (380). Ob und wo der Zyklus von Fresken mit alttestamentarischen Szenen ausgefhrt wurde, der von Torino del f Baldese 1348 gestiftet worden war, ist nicht festzustellen (vgl. Anm. 379). Die Fresken wurden groenteils durch die Umbauten von 1565 ff. Zerstrt. Steintabernakel komposition Ordnung fr Altarbilder errichtete Vasari in den beiden Seitenschiffen 1565 ff.; ersetzt 1861 ff. Durch die jetzigen neugotischen (381). lterer Fuboden , von Fra Minia Lapi (1321-76 im Kloster) gestiftet und vielleicht auch hergestellt; 1861 ff. ersetzt (382). Darin, unregelmig angeordnet, eine groe Zahl von Grabplatten ; 1861 in der jetzigen regelmigen Anordnung neu verlegt (383). Fassadenwand. Altar westlich neben dem Hauptportal (zunchst den Hlg. Drei Knigen geweiht, spter wohl der Verkndigung Mariae; Patrone: del Lama, dann Fedini, Ende 16. Jahrh. Mondragine, im 17. Jahrh. Vecchietti) (384). Erste Dekoration: Mensa aus Marmor, mit Tafelbild , Anbetung der Hlg. Drei Knige, von Sandro Botticelli; gemalt im Auftrag des Gasparre di Zanobi del Lama, um 1475; jetzt in den Uffizien, Nr. 882 (385). ber dem Altar (?) Fresko , Geburt Christi, Art des Sandro Botticelli, um 1470; 1857 ff. In das Bogenfeld des Hauptportals an der Fassadenwand versetzt, bgl. Dort. Zweite Dekoration: auf dem Altar seit etwa 1603 das Gemlde der Verkndigung Mariae, von Santi di Tito, gemalt fr den Spanier Fabio Mondragone; 1861 in die Gondi-Kapelle versetzt, jetzt im vierten Joch des linken Seitenschiffs, vgl. Dort.  1857/61 wurde der Altar aufgehoben und an seine Stelle das Fresko der Dreieinigkeit von Masaccio bertragen. Altar stlich neben dem Hauptportal (ursprnglich dem hlg. Vincenz dem Bekenner geweiht unter dem Patronat des Klosters; seit etwa 1576 unter dem Patronat der Attavanti, spter der Ricasoli; im 18. Jahrh. dem hlg. Vincenz Ferrer geweiht) (386).

Ersetzt durch das Triptychon , Erzengel Raffael mit Tobias und zwei Hlg., Schule des Castagno; jetzt im 5. Joch des linken Seitenschiffs (vgl. dort).  1857 wurde der Altar aufgehoben und das dahinterliegende Verkndigungsfresko aufgedeckt. Mittelschiff. An einem Pfeiler rechts zeitweise Weihwasserbecken, 1300/02 (vgl. Anm. 414). Im dritten Joch ber den Arkaden rechts und links Fresken , Bildnisse des Andrea di Niccol Minerbetti (Gonfaloniere von 1387) und seiner Frau Francesca; 2. H. 14. Jahrh. (387); verloren. Bronzgrabplatte des Lionardo Dati, von Lorenzo Ghiberti; jetzt vor dem Hochaltar (vgl. Unter Ausstattung, Mittelschiff). Mnchschor (388). Freistehend im Langhaus, geschaffen durch Ummauerung der beiden letzten Mittelschiffsjoche vor der Vierung, nach der Hauptchorkapelle zu offen (vgl. S. 674); ganz oder teilweise mit Marmor (390) verkleidet; entfernt 1565 durch Vasari (vgl. Baugeschichte). Oben auf den halbhohen dicken Mauern standen, durch einen Laufgang miteinander verbunden, vier Altre, eine Orgel, ein Lesepult und andere Ausstattungsstrcke (vgl. unten). Die Stirnseite (ponte) war anscheinend hher als die Flanken. Das Innere war zugnglich vom Mittselschiff aus durch eine groe vergitterte Bogentr, die reggie, die von zwei Altren eingerahmt wurde, von den Seitenschiffen aus durch je eine Seitentr (391); von einer Seitentr hat sich vielleicht ein Marmorpilaster im Grabmal des Tommaso Minerbetti, jetzt im vierten Joch des rechten Seitenschiffs, erhalten. Neben jeder Seitentr auen ein Altar. Die Altre auf dem ponte standen an den Pfeilern, einander zugekehrt, also mit der Schauseite nach dem Inneren des Chores; ebenso zwei weitere Altre, einer auf der stlichen, einer auf der westlichen Mauer. Fassade. stlich vom Eingang Altar (der hlg.

Mit dem Altar und den Grabmlern in die Sakristei berfhrt, seit 1810 in der Akademie, Nr. 8606 (393).  Westlich vom Eingang Altar (dem hlg. Petrus Martyr geweiht, Patrone: Castiglione-Dietisalvi), errichtet 1298, erneuert 1484 (394). Hier wohl Altarfresko, Martyrium des hlg. Petrus Martyr, byzantinisierende Malerei, wohl um 1298; 1572 in den Durchgang zwischen Chiostro Verde und Chiostro Grande bertragen, vgl. dort S. 723. Ostwand (Auenseite). Altar (dem hlg.

Jahrh.; wohl 1565 entfernt, verschollen (396). Daneben wahrscheinlich die beiden Wandgrber der Minerbetti, jetzt im 4. Joch des rechten Seitenschiffs (vgl. dort); versetzt um 1572.  An derselben Wand Fresko oder Tafel , hlg. Hieronymus, von Taddeo Gaddi, 1. H. 14. Jahrh. (397); wohl 1565 entfernt, verschollen. Dicht dabei der Begrbnisplatz der Familie Gaddi.

Markus geweiht; spter als Katharinen-Altar unter dem Patronat der Bruderschaft der hlg. Katharina von Siena) (398). Zeitweise (1494) stand hier wohl das Tafelbild der hlg. Lucia, von Davide der Ghirlandaio (?), das sich jetzt im vierten Joch des linken Seitenschiffs befindet (vgl. dort); 1565 wurde der Altar an die Westwand des Seitenschiffs versetzt; fr weitere Schicksale vgl. 2. Joch des linken Seitenschiffs. Laufgang oben auf der Mauer: ber dem Mittelportal wohl der gemalte Kruzifix von Giotto, jetzt in der Sakristei, vgl. dort.  Am stlichen Pfeiler Altar (dem hlg. Ludwig geweiht, Patrone: Ardinghelli; gegrndet anscheinend zugleich mit dem ponte, um 1300) (399). Altartafel, hlg. Ludwig von Frankreich, zu Fen des Hlg. das Stifterpaar, von Giotto, um 1300 (400); wohl 1565 entfernt, verschollen.  Am westlichen Pfeiler Altar (des hlg.

        "content"  : "The Loggia of the Bigallo Among the most praiseworthy decisions made by the rulers of Tuscany in the wake of the dismantling of the Austro-Lorraine dynasty was the one to reopen the loggia of the Bigallo on the square of the Duomo. After a few years of waiting, the desires of the people were realized through the wise direction of the architect Mariano Falcini, whose restoration work can still be seen in the upper sections of the building. I believe it is important to reveal information I have uncovered about this building and its artistic value. This elegant loggia was built by the Captains of the Misericordia for the purpose both of celebrating the charity of the city [which supported the foster home of the Bigallo] and of alerting the public to the fate of those children who, abandoned in the streets, were reunited with the same inhuman parents who came to collect them. I have already addressed the issues of when and how the institution was born, as well as its primitive purpose, in my work on Charitable institutions published in 1853 by Le Monnier; and here I would like to note that recent archival discoveries have confirmed that the Society of the Misericordia was formed after the plague of 1326 by members of the Company of the Laudesi of the Virgin of Orsanmichele, which contradicts the fairy tales invented by the priest Lorenzo Fici in 1605 and repeated by other writers who have examined this pious place. The rectors of the benevolent association, made rich in 1348 thanks to the legacies it received, maintained a stable place to exercise those works of piety that were appropriate in their institution. To this end, considering the opportunity of building on their site  donated to them by Giovanni dAlbizzo Pellegrini on 16 September 1354  the rectors considered building a chapel and some rooms in a structure on the Piazza S. Giovanni. However, the site seemed too cramped for such a building and rectors beseeched the Florentines for additional space. On January 21 of the following year (1355) the commune and people of Santa Reparata gave them an additional 10 braccie (about six meters) of territory on the corner of the Corso Adimari, which they used to build their oratory.[1] This is the most accurate date for the building: Vasari incorrectly attributed the design to the hand of Nicola Pisano, who had already been dead for a century when the building was actually constructed. We do not know the name of the architect, but it is not unlikely that Andrea Orcagna had a part in it, because the style of the building closely matches his own: but this can not be determined with certainty, due to the fact that we have lost the books from the Capitani della Misericordia that record transactions between 1352 and 1358. The construction of the loggia was completed in 1358, and in that year they closed the arches with iron gates, made by Francesco Petrucci, a famous Sienese artist known for other works of a similar kind: and these little gates could not have been of poor quality when installed, for their maker was paid the conspicuous sum of 55 gold florins.[2] At the same time Alberto Arnoldi carved for the altar of the chapel the statue of Virgin Mary and the two angels at her side; and this work produced between 1359 and 1364 was produced by a member of the illustrious school of Andrea Pisano who received 280 gold florins. He (Alberto Arnoldi) simultaneously produced the other image of the Madonna, placed on the door beside the oratory there in the piazza di San Giovanni, which he finished in June of 1361 for 16 gold florins. Even this report was misconstrued by Vasari, who judged these sculptures as the work of Andrea Pisano and his chief assistant, Ciognara, which I noted in my abovementioned book.[3] The Captains records recount the funding of fresco paintings that decorated the vaults of the chapel in 1363, which were produced by the two painters Nardo and Bartolommeo. The first of these was probably the brother of Andrea Orcagna (Nardo di Cione), and the other was the Sienese painter named Bartolommeo, believed to be the same Bulgarini who performed many works in the city of Florence. In addition to these paintings, Giunta and Rossello later painted works in 1425, and others were executed on the walls by Giovanni di Donnino in 1436.[4] I do not know the subject or even the form of these paintings because they are not described in the aforementioned books, and now they can no longer be seen as they were hidden from view by the plaster that was laid on as a whitewash coat in 1760, ordered by the rector at that time named Angiolo Maria Ricci in an attempt to highlight the baroque ornaments more recently executed by Stefano Fabbrini. Today we protest this barbarism: but our ancestors did not think so, as that was the taste of that century. While they painted the vaults, they hired a painter named Ambrogio, perhaps Lorenzetti or Baldesi: but that is not what is currently seen on the altar, because this work was replaced in 1512 by a remarkable altarpiece painted by Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio and made with beautiful relief carvings by Antonio Carota, a famous artist at that time. Records in the Captains account books indicate that Niccol di Piero Gerini and Ambrose di Baldese, arriving in 1386, painted on the exterior wall of the oratory that beautiful fresco that is now displayed in the room of the Commissioner of the orphanage S. Maria del Bigallo. The fresco, which was transferred there in 1777, represents on one side a group of children being separated from their parents and, on the other, joyful mothers receiving the children they had previously abandoned to the care of the brothers of the Misericordia.[5] It is well known that the benefices and privileges given to the Company by the whole city would not be enough to prevent the ruin of the pious association. Despite by the protection of Cosimo the Elder of the Medici, the poor management of the confraternity threatened its solvency, and in 1425 two confraternities joined to form one, in a way that enhanced the revenues of the Misericordia in ways from which Cosimo could benefit. As a natural consequence, the former duties of the Misericordia were ceased. When, after many years, it was deemed important to revive it to a new life, the memory of Cosimos intrigues caused the commune in 1489 to abolish the ability of private citizens to interfere with the interests of the charitable institution. Turning now to the artistic issues that surround this place, we learn that the new masters of the recomposed confratnernity, the Capitani del Bigallo  perhaps to erase the memory of their usurpation of the Misericordia in 1425  moved to decorate the outer walls of the palace above the oratory with paintings that represented a more favorable account of these facts. They did so when, after a disasterous fire damaged the oratory on July 23, 1442, the captains rebuilt most of the upper half of the building. The paintings have never been correctly interpreted: Lastri, Rosselli, and Landini attributed them to Taddeo Gaddi, but were understandably confused by their style which seem consistent with other pictures of the time. Richa, Rumhor and Becchi mistakenly ascribed them to Piero Chellini, who did indeed work for the Bigallo, but more as a whitewasher than an artist (as I demonstrated in my book on Florentine charity, in which I cited the documents that reveal that Ventura di Moro and Rossello di Iacopo of Scolaio Franchi were the authors of these frescoes in 1445.[6] Here we bring to a close our discussion of this place, not wishing to examine the adjacent building or the works of Filippo di Cristofano, Ambrose di Baldese and Mariotto di Nardo, who painted unusual pictures there: all of this material I have published in my book on the charities of this city on pages 9, 150 and following. Notes [1] In the 1354th year of our Lords incarnation, on January 21, Mr. Giovanni, son of Sir Piero the surveyor of the commune, and Mr. Tomaso di Iacopo di Passero, master of the commune, in the presence of Mr. Bartolo, the procurator of the major church of Florence, and other priests and dignitaries, in order to build an oratory on the corner of the Piazza di San Giovanni, give ten braccie of territory (give or take some space) from the primary area of the via degli Adimari, next to the column of the house adjacent to the said building. They declare this and bid the notary Ser Matteo di Gherardo da Panico to write down the agreement (see Florence, Archivio di Stato, Bigallo, Libro II of Delib. e Stanziamenti, fascicolo I, carte 28). [2] In the 1358th year of our Lords incarnation, on 9 March, Manetto di Giovanni Davanzati paid 55 gold florins to Francesco Petrucci da Siena for the iron gates of the oratory of the said company  Archivio centrale di Stato, Bigallo, Deliberazioni dei Capitano II, II, carte 7. [3] 1359, indiction 15, 18th day of June: Filippo di Bartolo Filippi, Rusticho Donati, Filippo del Nero, Davanzato Iohanni (Davanzati), Giovanni di Firenze, e Francesco di Pero captions of this confratnerity, in their name and on half of their compatriots, deliberated on the following things: First, they agreed to offer to Alberto Arnoldo, master from the parish of San Michele Berteldi, the commission to produce an image in marble of Our Lady holding her Son in her arms in an act of mercy, decorated and adorned in gold and lustrious colors as is appropriate, with two angels: the Madonna should be at least three braccie tall (roughly 1.5 meters) and the two angels at least two and half braccie tall (roughly 1.25 meters). All of these figures must be by the hand of Alberto, who shall receive a salary of 55 florins for the figure of our Lady and one hundred thirty florins for the two angels, who should be holding candles in their hands: the figure of Mary should be of a higher quality than the figure of Our Lady in Pisa. Its quality will be judged by three or four masters deemed to be qualified by the city of Florence, which shall appoint them at the time. And if it is deemed to be inferior to the one in Pisa, the Bigallo will not be obligated to keep it. And the images of the marble angels must be of the same quality and beauty of the said figure of Mary. He will be paid in the following manner: he will recieve an initial payment of one hundred gold florins, and when the figure of Our Lady has been completed to our satisfaction he will have fifty gold florins, and when he has completed the angels he will receive fifty gold florins; he will compose and install in the oratory the figures at his own expense. And the figures will be completed in two years from the time of their initiation, as indicated by the date of the first payment of one hundred florins. See the statement notarized by Ser Tino (aforementioned book, carte 12). 1364, 16 August. They met and absolved the master Alberto Arnoldi and his son, Alesso, of wrongdoing in the production of the figures of Our Lady and angels, and they declared him to be in accord with the agreement made, and they asked me to check the contract and all the agreements, which I annulled and canceled (see carte 57). 1361, indiction 14, 25 June. They deliberated and decided to send the companys administator (burser) to pay the debt of 16 gold florins to the master Alberto Arnoldo as final payment for the figure and marble image of Our Lady holding her blessing son at her breast, which was positioned over the portal of the oratory. [4] 1363, 24 June. The captains directed the administrator to pay the painter, Bartolommeo, 62 lire, 4 sold, and 6 denari for pictures at the head of the oratory (see carte 37). 1363, 24 October. The Captains of the Misericordia  Statio Dati, Tellino Dino, Piero Borsi, Duccio di Giovanni, Ruberto Martelli  in the name of the confraternity and the company, discussed a number of things listed below. First they discussed the work in the Oratory where one sees figures, that is on the face of the pedestal made by the master Ambrogio that is designed and made as well as is possible; for the best value, make sure we dont spend more than 100 gold florins. They also discussed the work that they want done by Nardo the painter for the price of forty florins, in that form that Tino wants; in these things they directed me to make a contract to hire them. [5] 1386, 5 July. The Captains of the Misericordia - Giovanni Federighi, Nuto di Francesco, Giusto di Coverello, Soldo di Lippo Soldani, Francesco di Lutozzo (Nasi), e Iacopo del Riccio, minus the absent Tommaso di Francesco  gave to the painters Niccol di Piero and Ambrogio di Baldese, on June 22, seventeen gold florins for the completion of work on the paintings on the facade of the front of the Residence of the Misericordia, as appears in this book of entries (see book 3, carte 27 verso). [6] 1446  Ventura di Moro, painter, received four florins on 27 May, as appears in the fourth book of accounts by Giovanni da Filicaia, our administator, on carte 108. And on the 28th of August fifteen florins were given to Rossello the painter for finishing half of the painting for the company of the history of Saint Peter Martyr on the facade of our company, as written down by our Syndicate, Lorenzo di Bartolommeo the painter (Archivio di Stato, Libro dei debitori e creditori del Bigallo del 1446 e 1447, G, carte 10. The pictures by Chellini must be those made to ornament the elegant windows at the top of the oratorys loggia, that the master restored from the antique when it was last left in a poor state. Heres the relative item: 1343, 10 March: The painter Piero Cellini and his followers may receive payment for the favorable execution of pictures; twenty lire for the procurement of lime and materials for scaffolding  Deliberazioni dei Capitani del Bigallo, 1443 e 1444, filza VI, carte 10). And I must add to this preceeding statement, noted not by me but by Rumhor and Becchi  1444, June 1, Piero Chellini painter for restoring pictures on the facade of the residence of the Captains. Original Text: La Loggetta del Bigallo Fu lodevole pensiero di chi reggeva le sorti della Toscana dopo la partenza della dinastia Austro-Lorenese quello di riaprire la loggetta che dicesi del Bigallo, sulla piazza del Duomo: e dopo alcuni anni di espettativa sono stati coronati i voti comuni, vedendosi finalmente compiuto, in parte, il lavoro sotto la sapiente direzione dellarchitetto Mariano Falcini, abbench resti ancora farsi il restauro del soprastante edifizio. Collegandosi a questo luogo non poche memorie artistiche, non stimo opera inutile lo esporre tutto quello che mi  stato concesso di ritrovare relativo a tale monumento. Questa elegante loggetta fu edificata dai Capitani di S. Maria della Misericordia alloggetto di esporvi alla pubblica piet quei fanciulli che, abbandonati per le vie, da essi si raccoglievano per tentare se modo vi fosse di riconoscere glinumani genitori, ed anche per sollecitare la carit cittadina a loro vantaggio. Quando e come nascesse la pia istituzione, qual fosse il primitive suo scopo, esposi in un mio lavoro sugliistituti di beneficenza edito nel 1853 coi tipi del Le Monnier: e qui mi piace di ripetere, poich ne ho avuta conferma dai documenti posteriormente trovati, che non mingannai, asserendo la Compagnia della Misericordia nata dai Laudesi della Vergine di Orsanmichele in occasione della peste del 1326, e che sono favole i racconti immaginati dal prete Lorenzo Fici nel 1605 e ripetuti da quanti scrissero sulla origine del luogo pio. I rettori del benefico sodalizio, fatti ricchi pei lasciti conseguiti nel 1348, pensarono ad avere un luogo stabile di residenza per esercitare quelle opere di piet cherano proprie del loro istituto. Al quale oggetto, pensando alla opportunit del locale, deliberarono di costruire una cappella ed alcune stanza sulla piazza di S. Giovanni, valendosi della casa che aveva ad essi donata Giovanni dAlbizzo Pellegrini, il 16 settembre 1354, nellatto di costituirsi loro servo per tutta la vita. Ma parendo ad essi troppo angusto quel luogo, sollecitarono la piet dei Fiorentini; n vi ricorsero invano, avvengnach ottennero dai poplani di S. Reparata altre dieci braccia di terreno sul canto del Corso degli Adimari, il 21 gennaio dellanno appresso, affinch vi potessero costruire il loro oratorio.[1] Questa  la data pi precisa delledifizio: laondo mal si appone il Vasari, ascrivendolo tra le opere di Niccol Pisano gi morto da un secolo. Ignorasi chi ne fu larchitetto, ma non  improbabile che vi avesse parte Andrea Orcagna, perch lo stile delledifizio molto si acosta a quello chera proprio di lui: n mai potr determinarsi con sicurezza, mancando tra i libri dei Capitani della Misericordia tutti quelli che vanno dai primi mesi del 1352 al 1358. La costruzione della loggia era compiuta nel 1358, ed in quellanno se ne chiudevano le arcate con cancelli di ferro, che facevansi da Francesco Petrucci, celebre artista senese noto per altri lavori di simil genere: e quelle cancellate non dovevano certamente essere povera cosa quando pagavansi allartefice la somma, allora cospicua, di 55 fiorini doro.[2] Contemporaneamente Alberto Arnoldi scolpiva per laltare della cappella la statua di Maria vergine ed i due angeli che le stanno ai lati; e questa opera conducevasi dallillustre scolare di Andrea Pisano tra il 1359 ed il 1364, ricevendone prezzo di 280 fiorini doro: mentre lavorava nel tempo istesso allaltra immagine della Madonna che posa sulla porta di fianco delloratorio, nella piazza di S. Giovanni, la quale di finita nel giugno del 1361 per 16 fiorini doro. Anche rapporto a questo fu tratto in errore il Vasari, giudicando queste scolture opera di Andrea Pisano: della qual cosa rec prova il Cicognara prima di ogni altro, ed a quelle altre io ne aggiunsi nel mio libro sopra citato, che qui, come in luogo pi conveniente, riporto.[3] Gli stanziamenti dei Capitani conservano memoria delle pitture a fresco colle quali decoravansi le volte della cappella nel 1363, a cui attendevano i due dipintori Nardo e Bartolommeo: il primo dei quali fu assai probabilmente il fratello di Andrea Orcagna, e laltro il senese Bartolommeo, creduto dei Bulgarini, che assai opere esegu nella citt di Firenze. A queste debbono aggiungersi quelle che in epoca assai posteriore, nel 1425, dipingevano Giunta e Rossello, e le altre che furono eseguite sulle pareti da Giovanni di Donnino nel 1436.[4] Non mi  noto il soggetto e neppure la forma di cotali pitture, perch nei rammentati libri non si descrivono: ed ora non pi possono vedersi, essendo nascosto dallintonaco che vi distese sopra un imbianchino nel 1760, dordine dAngiolo Maria Ricci allora rettore dellOratoria; a cui parve che miglior figura dovessero fare i barocchi ornati che vi fece eseguire da Stefano Fabbrini. Noi gridiamo alla barbarie: ma i nostri vecchi non pensavano cosi, e quello era il gusto del secolo. Mentre essi dipingevano le volte, si faceva il gradino da un pittore nomato Ambrogio, forse il Lorenzetti o il Baldesi: ma non  quello ch si ammira attualmente sullaltare, perche questo, opera tra le pi pregevoli di Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio, fu sostituito allantico nel 1512, allorquando fu costruito il nuovo altare ricco dei belli intagli da Antonio Carota celebre artista in quel tempo. Si ha memoria nei libri di uscita dei Capitani che Niccol di Piero Gerini e Ambrogio di Baldese, volgendo il 1386, dipingevano sulla parete esterna delloratorio quel bellaffresco che ora si ammira nella stanza in cui risiede il Commissario dellattiguo orfanotrofio di S. Maria del Bigallo, l trasferito nel 1777, rappresentante alcuni fanciulli smarriti, e tra essi diverse madri tutte festanti per vederseli restituiti dai confratelli di S. Maria della Misericordia.[5]  noto come i benefizi impartiti alla intiera citt non bastassero ad impedire la rovina del pio sodalizio; avvegnach Cosimo il vecchio dei Medici, protettore della Compagnia del Bigallo, la quale per effeto di mala amministrazione era prossima a sciogliersi, fece di maniera che nel 1425 delle due fraternite se ne formasse una sola, per potere coi redditi della Misericordia arricchire quella di cui voleva vantaggiare glinteressi. Comera naturale conseguenza del fatto, cess lesercizio delle opere pie cherano proprie della Misericordia; e quando dopo molti anni si rese indispensabile di richimarla a novella vita, quei che ne dettarono i nuovi statui, nel 1489, memori dei danni arrecati da Cosimo Medici, decretarono in modo che lautorit e linfluenza dei cittadini statuali fosse minima nel luogo pio. Tornando ora alle notizie artistiche de questo luogo, debbo notare che i nuovi padroni, i Capitani del Bigallo, forse per cancellare la memore della loro usurpazione, vollero rappresentati sulle pareti esterne del palagetto sovrastante alloratorio i fatti relativi alla loro istituzione, e vi si decisero allorquando si trovarono astretti a riedificare in gran parte la met superiore delledifizio danneggiato da un furioso incendio il 23 luglio 1442. Il Lastri, il Rosselli, e il Landini attribuiscono quelle pitture a Taddeo Gaddi, ma basta per confutarli il conoscere il tempo nel quale furono condotte: Richa, Rumhr e Becchi le danno a un Piero Chellini, ma sono anchessi in errore. Lavor invero questo artista per il Bigallo, ma fu adoperato in opere pi proprie di un imbianchino che dun artista, siccome io dimostrai, citando i documenti, nella mia storia della beneficenza fiorentina; nel quale libro riportai ancora testualmente le memorie dalle quali si desume che Ventura di Moro e Rossello di Iacopo di Scolaio Franchi furono gli autori di questi affreschi, nel 1445.[6] Qui hanno termine le notizie artistiche de questo luogo, non stimando opportuno di addentrarmi nellattiguo edifizio, dove pure si conservano non ispregevoli dipinture, n di parlare delle opere di arte eseguite da Filippo di Cristofano, da Ambrogio di Baldese e da Mariotto di Nardo, per le quali tutte e pei documenti che vi si riferiscono pu vedersi il rammentato mio libro sugli stabilimenti di beneficenza di questa citt a pagine 9,150 e seguenti.

        "content"  : "Translation by George Bent Giuseppe Richa, Notizie Istoriche delle chiese Fiorentine VII, Bigallo, 251-65, 282-96. (251) Never have I written a history of a place so well documented as this one; and I have at my disposal two writings by diligent people intimately related to the Oratory, the company, and the magistrates of the Bigallo. The first of these, made by the order of Ferdinand II, was written by the Dr. Ambrogio Ambrogi, the Chancellor of the Magistrates of the Bigallo. The second appears in a very short but erudite letter by the Doctor Angiol Maria Ricci, lecturer of Greek at the Florentine Sapienza (the university) and Provost of the Bigallo of which we speak. And while it might seem that do not necessarily need to consult these works by minor authorities, in truth their texts illustrate some points that we do not encounter in other writings. Therefore it seems necessary to relate their comments, and the first we will consult is that by Ambrogi, who says the following: Study of the Bigallo, by Doctor Ambrogi for the Granduke II. The major Florentine confraternity of S. Maria del Bigallo was founded by Fra Pietro da Verona who, as a sixteen-year old was studying in Bologna in 1221, was favorably judged by Domenic, the patriarch of the Order of Preachers, and entered the Dominican order. After having illustrated his eloquence and goodness (252) by preaching in the principle cities of Italy, in 1252  the same year as his glorious martyrdom in the name of the holy faith, perpetrated somewhere between Como and Milan  he was elevated by Innocent IV into the Catalog of Saints and dubbed S. Peter Martyr. For over 500 years, despite the ravages of time, the floods of the Arno, and other failures, his fame has been recognized by the public, as well as in the books of the confraternity of the Misericordia, so much that he is considered their principle saint. And it is in the Oratory that passed to the Misericordia in the Bigallo (a story we shall soon recount) that we see today a perpetual monument to the glorious ancient founder in the form of what was then considered an important painting on its faade in the Piazza di S. Giovanni that represents his most important act in our city. That is, when he commanded the nobility of Florence to defend the purity of the Holy Faith in the name of their fellow Florentines and sent them to the Piazza Santa Felicita and the Croce al Trebbio carrying with them the banner of the Vermilion Cross on the White Field  which is still preserved with reverence in S. Maria Novella. As the Dominicans tell it, they won two great victories against the Manichean heretics (the Patarini), and then erected two columns on behalf of the commune on that spot to commemorate their glorious accomplishment. At that moment the sign of the Holy Cross expelled the Devil, who fled from them in the form of a black horse sprinting ferociously from the Via de Feriavecchi to the Piazza Mercato Vecchio, where the saint was then preaching, in an attempt to intimidate and harass all the people who had come to hear him speak so that they could not listen to the Word of God. On behalf of the holy father and for the sake of his Inquisitor General, (253) Peter Martyr had examined the piety and spiritual exercises of the seven men who had founded the Order of the Servants of Mary, located on Mount Senario. They understood that the zeal and forbearance in the city of Florence was caused by the multitude of people there who were predisposed to do the work of divine Mercy that was so beneficial to mankind that God promised to these meritorious men a place next to him in his Kingdom of Heaven. We must understand how, from these difficult circumstances, the confraternity of noble Florentines came to care for the destitute, and how they evolved under the watchful patronage of the Virgin Mary, from whose mouth we have heard the sweet great words repeated by Peter the Apostle: Ego pro te oravi Petre, ut non deficiat fides tua. I, Peter, pray to you that my faith may not fail. III. In order to maintain the very best constitution and for the sake of the holy works of their founding father, this confraternity immediately began to pursue with ardor important things in the various areas of Charity that could help the most destitute people from cradle to adulthood. Spurred on by the urgings of priests, prelates, and even papal figures who promised them Indulgences, Privileges, and other spiritual prerogatives, more than just a few leading citizens bequeathed copious inheritances to the confraternity to fund their pious works. This constituted a sizable amount of money, large enough to provide support for those orphans and other equally poverty-stricken people who sought the aid of Jesus Christ. And this work was done from the church of S. Maria Novella from 1279 up until the residence of the Bigallo was actually constructed in honor of God, the Madonna, (254) and all the saints. IV. The company was led by a group of officials, periodically called priors, rectors, and then captains, all selected by lottery according to a quota system of two per quarter, much like the way priors were selected to govern the city in those times. Additionally, these leaders were assisted by a notary, a procurator, a chamberlain, and other figures who were brought on from time to time according to need. V. This system of officials and ministers was established long before the company had its own residence, during that period when they operated out of the churches of S. Maria Novella, S. Donato tra le Torri, Orsanmichele, and other places  including a number of hospitals that cared for the destitute. They moved from place to place until that time they were able to build their own residence in the parish of S. Bartolo nel Corso, located on property donated to them by the city of Florence that was situated next to the houses owned by the Macci family, all of which was recorded in a contract written by Ser Piero di Ser Grifo on 20 June 1352. VI. Continues to discuss the other hospitals in and around Florence.. 282 Chapter 28 The Oratory of the Bigallo, III Thanks to the learned Doctor Angelo Maria Ricci, who conveyed this information about the history of the Bigallo in a letter. I. Its a truly marvelous thing that youre doing to write this precise and accurate history of Florentine churches. Its important that every Florentine read your work, not just to praise it, but to understand all the things that have been done here and what was taken from us by foreignors. II. My contribution, which concerns the great works undertaken by those in the Oratory of S. Maria del Bigallo, has been written with the sanction of the Regent (of Austria) in the name of the most August sovereign. III. Andrea Pisano made the marble statue that represents the standing Madonna with the Christ Child in her arms, which can be seen in a beautiful niche above the altar. Two marble angels are there, too, but they seem to be somewhat feminine and they wear on their heads tiaras (283) similar to the one worn by the Madonna that suggest theyre Jewish women. Its said that a master named Antonio, called il Carota, designed the beautiful wooden altar and decorated it richly. IV. The son of Domenico Ghirlandaio painted the small scenes in the predella below. Five pictures of better quality also appear. In the middle picture is painted the Madonna smiling at two angels, with her arms and her cloak open to them. To her right and above appears Jesus Christ with his arms open; and at the feet of the Virgin one sees two bishops and other people, some religious and some secular, and then many women in different positions of veneration. At the farthest point on the right of the same painting appears the Virgin in adoration, Joseph in contemplation, and the Baby Jesus lying almost comically on a red cloak. To the left is the Virgin holding the Child in her arms while Joseph, in the lead, takes them to Egypt. V. In the painting in the Cornu Evangelii (literally, the Horn of the Evangelist) the painter created a passionately rendered figure of St. Peter Martyr dipping his finger into his own blood to write in the earth the Apostles Creed. Above we see the assassin about to commit a second crime, chasing after the frightened friar who accompanied the Saint. The assassin carries in his left hand a shield upon which appears a half scorpione and three crowns, one arranged on top of the other, fall from the sky in front of the Holy Martyr, Saint Peter. The picture in the Cornu Epistolae (literally, the Horn of the Epistle Writers) appears Tobit in an act of unearthing a corpse, helped by Tobias (his son). And here one sees in the loggia of the morgue with the old gates, that were later removed in order to wall up the area. In the painting we can see the two facades, where today appear the Porta dellOratorio and the one next to it. Finally, there appears a funeral bier, the sign of the Company of the Misericordia. In some of the rood screens (tramezzi) (284) that appear in these paintings we see two round paintings, each one bearing the coats of arms of the Company of the Bigallo  that is, with a white rooster on a blue field with the letters S. M. B.  and those of the Company of the Misericordia  that is, with a red cross on a similarly blue field with the letters F. M. E. (Its important to note that today the coat of arms of the Misericordia appears to change the F to an R. This is because in the old script the F had a long horizontal line at the top which attached to the horizontal line below, which then seemed to form an R). Below we see seven areas filled with three large panels and four smaller ones. In the largest panel in the middle appears the Assumption of the Virgin among angels who hold flowers. In the smaller flanking panels of the Cornu Evangelii appear the figure of Tobias, the Angel, and the Fish. VI. Following along in the same area, but in one of the major pictures, we come to a painting of the Holy Virgin kneeling on the ground before the Holy Father above her, with angels surrounding them like courtiers. The nude figures of Adam and Eve join them, according to the tradition in which they are shown being judged by God. VII. In the little panel at the top of the grade appears woman, perhaps a Sybil, writing something, joined by two others in small pictures at the Cornu Epistolae. In the large panel between them is painted the Annunciation of the Virgin. VIII. Above these is a tabernacle venerated on the Feast of S. Peter Martyr, in which is a carved and gilded relief by the same Master Antonio, called il Carota. Inside the tabernacle, on the bottom part, lies a gilt bronze scene featuring a statuette of S. Peter Martyr with a knife in his cloak and a sword pushed into his right leg, and with the palm of his right hand. In the upper part appear the letters N. I. along with evidence of an A and other letters no longer visible. (285) This letters demand interpretation if we wish to understand them. In the windows of the tabernacle appears S. John the Baptist, in the back right, and Tobit in the left, painted sometime around 1510  the same time as the other pictures here  by the same artist responsible for them: but not by Domenico Ghirlandaio, as many believe, but rather by one of his three sons  Davide, Benedetto, or Ridolfo: Domenico had been dead since 1493. At the foot of the tabernacles base is sculpted the martyrdom of S. Peter Martyr, in the same way that the scene appears in the painting described above. IX. In this oratory, dedicated to the Virgin Mary and therefore called S. Maria del Bigallo, people venerate also S. Peter Martyr and Tobit, as is evident by their appearance in the three paintings in the upper zone. Members celebrate solemnly the Feasts of the Annunziation, S. Peter Martyr, Tobit on the third Sunday in September, when the story of the prophet is read inside the church. Beginning with First Vespers, his feast day is observed with the ritual that doubles that of the First Class. X. The feast observed with the most pomp and solemnity, however, is that of S. Peter Martyr due to his position as founder of the Bigallo and his important preachings against the Paterini Heresy. These episodes are depicted in two extremely old paintings produced, we think, by Taddeo Gaddi in the arches on the side of the Oratory  one in the area already described and the other over the place where the banners were given to the twelve men, called the twelve Good Men of the Bigallo, to fight the heretics. Some lovely sermons were delivered about the Paterini by the Doctor Giovanni Lami, that I heard in the Accademia della Crusca. One of the banners is kept in S. Maria Novella inside a Reliquary. (286) Another that appears there is a copy of the original: it bears a red cross on a white field with a red border around it, not unlike the banner given out as a prize for horse races, except that it is smaller and has no strip. In the painting the banners dont look like these, but thats probably due to artistic license. The other eleven banners were famously kept in the Bigallo, but were unfortunately lost alongside many old books: there is good reason to believe they perished in the violence of flooding at some point in time. XI. Depending on need, there are four officers of the Oratory. Among their other duties is the performance of mass  including the singing of three masses each week; one on Mondays for the Dead, another on Thursdays for Peace, and the last on Saturday for the Virgin Mary. The saying of Mass on Thursdays falls on the shoulders of Mone Fantini Taverniere (or Vinattiere) to placate any civil discord. XII. But because the above mentioned number of officers are not always available to perform these solemn festivals, other priests intervene in eight other feasts of lesser importance so that the oratory becomes something like a collegiata, or collegiate church, if one considers the offices, masses, and choruses performed vigorously by pious and devout people, just as they were in ancient times. XIII. The Company of S. Maria del Bigallo had been founded to perform charitable works and was supported by hospitals, including that of the Misericordia that provided burials for the dead, especially during times of plague. They were initially independent, but then the Misericordia of the Bigallo came under the domain of the church of S. Cristofano, and then moved to that location where they are today, which was initially the first Residence of the Magistrate of the Wards of the State. Ferdinando del Migliores (287) diligent review of the archives and his use of their documents confirms this history of the first iteration of the Misericordia. XIV. At last I refer to an unusually old document in a folder of parchment in the Oratorys archives, clearly prepared for them at their request, but undated so I dont know precisely when it was written. It appears in a book, two-feet tall and covered in wood with golden corners, that has been finished with a triangular image that shows Jesus emerging from his tomb on one leg with arms extended with a cross behind him. The following text accompanies the image: IN THE NAME OF GOD, AMEN. THIS BUILDING IS THE HOME OF THE GREAT COMPANY FOUNDED BY SAINT PETER MARTYR ON THE DAY OF THE ASCENSION OF CHRIST IN THE YEAR 1244 TO HONOR REVERENTLY OUR GLORIOUS MOTHER, THE VIRGIN MARY. EVERY THURSDAY A MASS OF PEACE IS PERFORMED: MEMBERS OF THE COMPANY WHO ATTEND RECEIVE AN INDULGENCE FROM PURGATORY OF THREE YEARS AND 320 DAYS, GRANTED TO THEM BY THE BISHOPS OF FLORENCE  SIR GIOVANNI AND SIR GOTTIFREDI AND SIR FRANCESCO  WHO GAVE TO THE COMPANY AN ADDITIONAL TWO YEARS AND 300 DAYS OF INDULGENCES. THE VENERABLE FRIARS GENERAL AND THE ORDER OF PREACHERS MINOR AND HERMITS AND CARMELITES AND MONKS OF ALL THE ORDERS CEDED TO THEM THE THINGS THEY NEEDED FOR ALL THE LIVING AND THE DEAD OF THE WORLD. XV. (288) On the opposite side, completely painted, is another triangle with a half-length Madonna holding the Christ Child in her arms, with S. Peter Martyr on their right holding a lily in his hand and S. Francis on their left holding a book. In the space below S. Peter Martyr (standing in front of confraternity members) consigns the standard to one of them, who kneels at his feet to receive it. Other standards in different colors, already handed out to other members, appear on the opposite side. This painting seems to have been produced by someone from the school of Giotto, perhaps an assistant, who may have copied it from him. XVI. Speaking of pictures, theres another similar standard above one of the arches, made of linen and in such poor condition that it is patched, that is now kept in S. Maria Novella. Everyone knows it is ancient. I have spoken of other things Ive observed, but I will have to tell you about this personally some other time. From my house on 5 May 1755, your devoted servant, Angio Maria Ricci. XVII. These writers, who have studied the documents, have established an accurate account of history. But, because they have some doubts about a few points, I will address some essential things they have omitted, like the origins of the two confraternities  that is, the primary company of the Virgin Mary called the Bigallo and the old Company of the Misericordia  whose union is misunderstood because, I believe, they were both founded by S. Peter Martyr. (289) Those who oppose this argument include the above-mentioned Ambrogio, Roselli, and many others. Ferdinando del Migliore supported it, as can be seen in Firenze Illustrata, where on page 78 he writes, Before passing over this, we must speak briefly of the other twelve hospitals under their care that were divided between two separate organizations: the first was called S. Maria del Bigallo (a.k.a. the company of S. Peter Martyr) and the other was called S. Maria della Misericordia, although both were governed by the same captains of the confraternity in Florence. This experiment lasted a long time, and with some success. But happily, in 1425  at a time when the citizens of Florence were preoccupied with threats from outside their walls and disastrous wars threatened the state  the city fathers deliberated in the Senate and passed a law that united the two companies and formed a new entity with the name of S. Maria del Bigallo. Eight captains governed the company and placed on the faade of their residence hall their coat of arms, which was a shield divided vertically with, in one section, a red cross on a black field with the letter F, on another the letter M in a gold band, and on the third part a white rooster on a blue background with the letters S.M.B. underneath. XVIII. Now I have reflected at length on this issue, and other difficult questions that demand explanation. For example, we wonder about the pictures of S. Peter Martyr painted by Taddeo Gaddi on the faade of the Oratory, or about identity of the person who painted the strip of the building facing the Baptistery of S. Giovanni that shows the image of the Company honoring their saintly founder. An objective critique of del Migliores position leads us to understand that the Bigallo, which was not yet united with the Misercorida until 1425, could not have commissioned Gaddi to paint these pictures: only the Company of the Misericordia could have done this, and yet the painter is said to have done every single picture there. Likewise wonder about the discrepancies contained in the writings about the foundation of the Bigallo, one which places it in 1240 and another in 1244, another which combines the two companies as a unified body at that early date. Its confusing because a contract written by Ser Piero di Ser Grifo, on 28 June 1352, says that the Signoria permitted the Bigallo to build its Residence in the parish of S. Bartolo al Corso: in 1352 the Misericordia and the Bigallo were two separate entities, as del Migliore says, and the latter didnt have a house later on. And if we said above that the captains first met in one specific place in the city, but then a different one, then it seems they didnt have an actual Residence Hall at all, and instead went from house to house as circumstances dictated or as benefactors permitted them use. I have in my possession a document written by the Captains in S. Maria sul Prato, which says the following: On 14 August, 1297, Mazzottus Bacherelli, Bartolus Ugolini, Ser Ciprianus q. Riccomanni, Ser Guido Spadaccii, Folchardinus Bonsignori, Ubaldinus Ardinghelli, Guido Ramaglianti, &amp;amp; Vieri Arrussi Rectores, the officers of the Society of the Blessed Virgin Mary, in concert with Corteccione the son of Iohannes de Rustici acting as official on behalf of the nuns of S. Maria del Prato in Florence: On this solemn day the above named men ceded to Corteccione the full license and deed to the Church of the Castagno held by Fra Humilis and Fra Michele for this confraternity, situated in Monte Basciano near the Caves of Verzaia, etc. to whom it may concern; (291) and if it is the case, as it seems, that the those who received the church and land departed from it, it would all return back to the Company of the Misericordia, the original owners. Witnessed by the notary Rusticus, son of Ugonis. XIX. Yet another problem arises when we consider the origins of the Oratory itself, the place of its original location, and its date of construction. Ambrogi says that the original Company of the Misericordia bought some houses from Baldinaccio degli Adimari at the piazza di S. Giovanni, and on this was built the Oratory and the Residence Hall. But Leopoldo del Migliore, on page 81, diverges from this argument when he writes: There we have the different stories about the old Oratory of the Misericordia, located where there was once the Tower of the Guardamorto and the public room of the exhibition of the cadavers, and at the same time says that the ruined tower was ceded to the Republic by S. Pieter of Verona in order to provide a place for the new Company of the Misericordia, which the Captains then used as their Oratory and Residence. Migliore depended entirely on Rossellis memoirs for this interpretation, and states unequivocally that the Oratory was built on top of the ruins of the tower with a strong foundation, large walls, and an impressive fortified gate, none of which could have been made for the Oratory of moderate height and weight. And we note that the delusional argument that the Oratory of the Bigallo was built between 1240 and 1244 cannot hold, because we see, on page 123 of the Malespini chronicle and on page 177 of Givoanni Villanis text, that the tower did not collapse until 1248: Villani writes, The Guelphs showed tremendous faith and dedication to the church, the cathedral, and the Baptistery of S. Giovanni, and they went there on Sunday mornings to worship, and had many weddings. When the Ghibellines decided to punish the Guelphs, they chose to destroy their fortress, the tower, that sat at the corner of the Corso Adimari on the piazza S. Giovanni. Designed by Nicola Pisano and called the Torre del Guardamorto, the tower had long been the favored resting place of the citys leading citizens who wished to be buried by the Baptistery. The Ghibellines tore down the supports, one by one, and burned them all; but, due to the wishes of God and Saint John the Baptist, only half of the tower fell into the piazza. They then ordered the destruction of the rest of the tower, which had been 120 braccia tall. We can see that the tower was both very close to the Baptistery of S. Giovanni and that it fell only during the sacrilegious vendetta of the Ghibellines in 1248, meaning that the Bigallo could not have participated in the building of the residence on the spot of the great architect Nicola Pisanos ruined tower. Unfortunately, an error in a diary written by Rondinelli indicates that, in 1411 the Oratory of the Bigallo was built on the alley of the Corso deBrigliai. Instead, we can see that the entirety of the Oratorys exterior, including the colonnettes, arches, and reliefs, were clearly built much earlier than this. XX. Then when the companies of the Bigallo and the Misericordia ceded the title of the captains, they became a conspicuous magistrate of Florence, whose principle concern revolved around the care of abandoned children, as we have seen in an earlier section of this book. During the early years of the Republic, the Bigallo received orphaned boys and girls separated from their parents and homeless, as seen in various official documents and statutes (293) of the commune, as for example under the rubric 117 of book 3, where we see the following words: Whoever found unattended children wandering through the streets brought them to the house of the Misercordia in the Piazza Orsanmichele, the official orphanage sanctioned by the commune; as well a these by Fra Domenico da Corella in his Theotocon from ca. 1460: Thus my tiny house was visited by the Madonna who has no pity. This is what happens when children are abandoned, for should the parent perish theres no telling what could happen to them. But they should be protected under a safe roof until they can be restored to their parents. This is what is expected in our pious city. XXI. And as I have already written of principle parts of this story, its appropriate to comment at last on some paintings inside, owned by the Bigallo but maintained by the aforementioned Dr. Angelo Maria Ricci, who is the head of the small but important collegiata. And therefore we consider a large picture above the great doorway into the building, painted in fresco, that represents a mourning mother (who has surrendered her child) in the midst of a variety of beautifully depicted orphans. She happily comes to receive her children from the captains of the Bigallo, and stands among the houses and towers that appeared there in those days, as is noted in a document of 1444, on page 8 in book X of the Bigallos archives, where one also sees the name of the painter: 1444 June 1. The Captains of the Bigallo and Misericordia order that payment be made from the orphanage to the painter, Piero Chellino, for the remainder of the work he has done to produce the painting on the faade of the captains residence. In the corridor of the main Audience Hall are some damaged paintings, blackened and broken not unlike those that occupy all the sections across from the Porta del Magistrato, (294) that were not intended to be seen this way. On the level of the stairs, four feet up toward the second floor, appears a Christ rising up out of his tomb with his arms open, holding in a sense a multitude of people seeking mercy; underneath are two inscriptions written in Gothic script that say, Oh, all you who pass this way, come inside and see my son on the cross who has died for your sins. If you have sinned, beg for mercy and you shall receive it. O sinners, it is because you have not wept for your sin that here you see the death of our Lord Jesus Christ who was crucified for your salvation. You would be wise to pray to the Mother of Mercy. XXII. And to the right of this door one sees and extremely old picture in fresco of a giant figure of the Madonna of Mercy, shown as a loving person wearing a cope and a round mitre on her head, with a fine stole, and at her feet are some worshippers from the Misericordia, with Longobard writing. This figure carries an air of a patron saint, with kneeling people on either side of a representation of Florence as it then appeared within the second circuit of city walls. The painter of this image explained his message in an inscription written in quasi-gothic hand that has a touch of antiquity to it, which states, All mercies and good works are done in this place according to the wise actions of its members, 1352. (295) Leaving this loggia, on the right hand side, are six hooks on the wall, two steps up the stairs and about six feet high, that according to tradition were used during the attack on the cathedral when S. Peter Martyr preached in the Piazza di S. Giovanni. We dont have any way to confirm this, other than the sayings of some old people, but well leave it up to the judgment of people to decide for themselves whether this is true. And on the door of the Audience Hall, by the coat of arms of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, appears an inscription that states, The most serene Cosimo the Great, Duke of Etruria; pious men affectionately serve to receive abandoned children, and then return them to worthy people who will care for them. XXIII. And here we reach of this story, where I must refer to the enormous struggles in and around Florence during the years of the plague that engendered so many tremendous charitable acts by our confraternity in the face of mass slaughter. The first occurred during the famine of 1325 caused by the war of the Altopascio; the second in 1340 that carried away a sixth of the population, many of them members of the nobility; the third was seven years later, in the year 1348 when the Black Death arrived and killed one hundred thousand souls, including the famous historian Giovanni Villani. His brothers, Matteo and Giovanni, succumbed to the plague of 1363, which was followed by two others that century, one in 1374 and the other in 1383. It came back again in 1400, this time called the Plague of the Bianchi after a certain flagellant confraternity that processed through the countryside, and again killed a lot of people. The ninth (sic) plague came in 1411 and the tenth (sic) in 1417, which killed 16 thousand more. There were others in 1422, 1430, and 1437. Another called the Anguinata came in 1449 and swept through the countryside. It was followed by one in 1465  the sixteenth great mortality  and another in 1479  the seventeenth  that took away Marsilio Ficino, author of the famous illustrated book called The Cure for Plague. Another three came in 1495, 1498, and 1509, although they were minor. The most ferocious and lengthy of them all lasted from 1525 to 1527, which Varchi says killed an almost infinite number of men. After this the city was preserved from plague for 103 years, until in 1630 when a new one was discovered in Milan, which traveled to the gates of Bologna, and then hit Florence hard. The Misericordia was active in those days, like its descendent is today, and received the praise of the people who came to it in times of need  and also in the final stages of plague  to find some peace. Long Live the Company of the Misericordia! But, of course, this was not the last of the plagues, for yet another returned in 1633: but thanks to the diligence of the Grand Duke Ferdinand, who knew enough about previous plagues to quarantine the entire city, the people were saved and the health of Italy was preserved thanks to the love, power, and diligence of the Prince. &amp;lt;/hr&amp;gt; Giuseppe Richa, Notizie Istoriche delle chiese Fiorentine VII, Bigallo, 251-65, 282-96. Sino=until Medesimo=same 251  I. Non mai ho scritto Istoria tanto ben corredata di autorevoli documenti, quanto la presente; imperciocch sono presso di me, di due illustri Persone diligentissime relazioni, o si voglia dellOratorio, o della Compagnia, o del Magistrato del Bigallo; la prima di dette Scritture fu fatta per ordine di Ferdinando II dal Dottore Ambrogio Ambrogi Cancelliere del Magistrato del Bigallo; la seconda consiste in una cortesissima, ed erudita lettera del Signor Dottore Angiol Maria Ricci, Lettor di lingua Greca nella Sapienza Fiorentina, e Proposto del medesimo Bigallo allAutor di questa Storia. E per vero dire non abbisognavano queste Lezioni di minore autorit; avvegnach per illustrar alcuni punti incontransi difficult di non leggiero momento. Quindi necessario mi sembra il riportare qui amendue, e il primo document sia quell dellAmbrogi, che dice come appresso: Relazione del Dotore Ambrogi al Granduca Sopra il Bigallo II. La Compagnia Maggiore di S. Maria del Bigallo della Citt di Firenze fu fondata da quell Fra Pietro da Verona, che nellanno 1221, sedicesimo di sua vita, mentre studiava in Bologna, fu ricevuto dal Patriarca S. Domenico nella sua novella Religione dePredicatori, e dopo lhavere illustrate le principali Citt dItalia con la sua dottrina, eloquenza, e bont, chiaro (252) per molti miracoli, sotto Innocenzio IV nellistesso anno 1252 del suo glorioso Martirio sostenuto tra Como, e Milano per la dilatazione della Santa Fede, merit di essere annoverato nel Catalogo deSanti sotto nome di S. Pier Martire: cos per continuata tradizione di circa 500 anni ne corre sino al presente pubblica la fama, et anco i libri pi antichi della medesima Compagnia, che lingiuria del tempo, linondazioni dArno non hanno totalmente laceri, e guasti, affermano questo gran Santo esserne stato lautore e il principio. E listesso Oratorio da che pass dalla Compagnia della Misericordia in questa del Bigallo, nel modo che si vedr poco appresso, ci rappresenta sino oggi a perpetua memoria di s glorioso Fondatore unantica, e secondo que tempi non mediocre pittura nella maggior facciata sulla Piazza di S. Giovanni, rappresentante la pi memoranda azione, che egli oper nella nostra Citt; cio quando a quenobili Fiorentini da lui schierati per difendere la purit della Santa Fede con cui si viveva in Firenze, diede il Gonfalone della Croce Vermiglia in campo bianco, che sino al presente con molta venerazione si conserva in Santa Maria Novella, con il quale su la Piazza di Santa Felicita, e dalla Croce al Trebbio, come largamente raccontano IIstorie Domenicane, ottennero contro gli Eretici Manichei quelle due gran vittorie, delle quali finora con due colonne erette dal Popolo Fiorentino nedetti due medesimi luoghi, dove furono ottenute, si conserva gloriosa la ricordanza. E quando con il segno della Santa Croce fece sparer di subito il Demonio, che in forma visibile di un nero e sfrenato Cavallo, velocemente correndo dalla Via deFeriavecchi alla Piazza di Mercato Vecchio, dove era il Santo a predicare, tentava di intimorire e sbaragliare il Popolo, che quasi senza numero vi era congregato al solito per ascoltarlo, e cos dimpedire il frutto della parola dIddio. Haveva veduto il Santo Padre, e per ragione del suo offizio di generale Inquisitore (253) diligentemente haveva esaminato il gran progresso nella via dello spirit, che tra le solitudini di Monte Senario andavano facendo i sette Nobili Contemplativi Fondatori dellOrdine de i Servi di Maria, e per il zelo, che teneva della salvezza deprossimi, poteva eziamdio haver considerate, che la Citt di Firenze non meno abbondava di Persone con ingenita attitudine agevolmente disposta allOpere della Misericordia Corporali, che infinitamente giovevoli al genere umano, et al Signore Iddio accettissime, costituiscono gli Uomini meritevoli appresso alla sua Divina pieta, del Regno deCieli. Onde dobbiamo di facile persuaderci, che da tali considerazioni incitato, ereggesse questa Compagnia di Nobili Fiorentini Secolari per sovvenimento delle Persone miserabili, ponendola con viva fede di memoranda progressi sotto il Patrocinio di Maria sempre Vergine, dalla cui bocca era stato favorite di udire quelle dolci, e gran parole, che gi allaltro Pietro Principe degliApostoli haveva detto lIncarnato Vergo: Ego pro te oravii Petre, ut non deficiat fides tua. III. Questa Compagnia per le ottime constituzioni, e per i divini ammaestramenti del suo buon Padre e Fondatore, cominci subito con ardore cos grande ad esercitarsi in tutte le Opere di Carit per sovvimento delle persone miserabili, che sino nesuoi teneri natali si acquist il nome di Maggiore. Fu da Sommi Pontefici, da molti Prelati di Santa Chiesa, e Superiori di Religioni adornata dIndulgenze, di Privilegi, e daltre spirituali prerogrativi, e da non pochi Cittadini gli fu fatto di grossi legati, lasciate copiose eredit, e raccomandata lesecuzione in perpetuo di pie disposizioni. Onde costituitasi una non mediocre sostanza, potette sempre assai largamente porgere aiuto alle miserabili fanciulle in sussidio di loro Dore (?), et in ogni altra maniera soccorrere alle necessit depoveri di Ges Cristo; e sino talora concerere alle gran fabbriche, che si ereggevano in onore di Dio, della sua Santa (254) Madre, e desuoi Santi, come in specie segu lanno 1279, per lOpera di Santa Maria Novella. IV. Era governata tempo per tempo da alcuni Ofiziali, che da principio si chiamarono Priori, e Rettori, e dipoi Capitani, quali si traevano dale borse, due per Sestiere, o per Quartiere, secondo che per i tempi si governava la Citt; e di pi haveva un Notaio, un Provveditore, un Camarlingo, et altri Ministri, secondo il bisogno. V. Si adunavano questi Offiziali, e Ministri, mentre la Compagnia per ancora non haveva luogo proprio, nella Chiesa di S. Maria Novella, e di S. Donato tra le Torri, da Orsammichele, et in altri luoghi, ma specialmente nelli Spedali alla lor Cura sottoposti, sin che si fabbricarno Residenza proporzionata nel Popolo di S. Bartolo nel Corso, accanto alle case deMacci, sopra il terrento donatoli dal Comune di Firenze per Instrumento rogato Ser Piero di Ser Grifo, 20 Giugno 1352.  282 Lezione XXVII DellOratorio del Bigallo III Lettera del Chiarissimo Signor Dottore Angelo Marie Ricci Proposto del Bigallo, allAutore della Storia. I. Meritevoli per vero dire di molta lode sono le sue premure di compilare unesatta Istoria delle Chiese Fiorentine, ed  ben giusto, che ogni Fiorentino, non solo le faccia applause, e le professi una grata riconoscenza, ma si adoperi eziandio in somministrarle notizie, e alleggerirle alcun poco una s grave fatica, che con gran maraviglia di chi ben riflette, Ella, che da altra patria trasse lorigine, ha coraggiosamente intrapresa. II. Ecco pertanto, che io dalla mia parte contribuisco alla sua grandOpera qualche coserella a me nonta intorno allOratorio di Santa Maria del Bigallo, di cui pochi mesi sono, conferita mi fu dallImperial Reggenza in nome dellAugustissimo Sovrano la Prepositura. III. Una Statua di marmo, al naturale rappresentante la Madonna in piedi col Bambino in collo, che si vede in una bella nicchia elevate sovra lAltare,  lavoro di Andrea Pisano. Vi sono dale bande due creduti Angioli pur di marmo, ma oltre al non aver lale, la lor sembianza par piurtosto femminile, ed hanno in testa la mitra delle Donne Ebree, ch si vede (283) de similmente in capo all suddetta Statua della Vergine. Ladornamento di tutto quanto lAltare  di legname dorato, molto vago e ricco, opera, dice il Migliore, dun tale Messer Antonio detto il Carota. IV. Due sono I gradi sottoposti dipinti con vari quadretti da alcuno deFigli di Domenico Ghierlandaio. Facendomi dal grado superior, cinque sono gli spartimenti, o dir vogliamo I quadretti. Nel quadretto di mezzo  dipinta la Madonna colle braccia aperte, e col manto disteso, sorretto da due Angioli. A man destra per di sopra  Ges Cristo col Costato aperto; a piedi poi della Vergine si vedono da una banda due Vescovi, e altre Persone, parte Religiose, e parte Secolari, e dallAltra molte femmine in diverse guise ammantate. Di pi dalla parte destra del medesimo quadretto  dipinta la Vergine in atto di adorazione, S. Giuseppe in atto di contemplazione, e Ges Bambino giacente in terra sur uno Strato rosso in atto quasi scherzoso. Dalla sinistra poi la Madonna col Bambino in collo, che va in Egitto, e S. Giuseppe avanti, che fa la guida. V. Nel quadretto in Cornu Evangelii effigi il Pittore con viva espressione S. Pier Martire gi ferito, inginocchioni, che scrive in terra col ditto intinto nel proprio sangue il Credo, e sopra si mira il fiero Sicario, che gli avventa un altro colpo, e il Frate compagnio del Santo, che spaventato se ne fugge. Il Sicario tiene colla mano sinistra uno scudo avente in mezzo uno scorpione, e tre corone calano gi dal Cielo una sopra laltra per ornar la fronte al Santo Martire. Nel quadretto in Cornu Epistolae v  Tobbia in atto di sotterrare un morto, aiutato da Tobbiolo. E qui si vede la loggia del Guardamorto colle cancellate antiche, che furon poi levate, e alzate in luogo di loro le pareti. Si vedono parimente le due facciate, cio quella dove  la Porta dellOratorio, e laltra laterale. Per ultimo  figurate da una banda la Compagnia della Misericordia col cataletto. Ne I tramezzi (284) dequadretti descritti vi sono due tondi, ognuno dequali porta le Armi della Compagnia di Santa Maria del Bigallo, che  un Gallo bianco in Campo azzurro con le tre lettere S. M. B. e della Comagnia della Misericordia, che  una Croce rossa in campo similmente azzurro, con le due lettere F. M. E. qui si vuol notare, che inoggi nellArme della Misericordia la lettera F  stata cangiata in R; il che  addivenuto perch avendo lF nella scrittura antica uno svolazzo allingi nella linea orizzontale superiore, questo essendosi allungaro, e attaccato colla linea orizzontale inferiore, ha forma un R. Il grado inferiore ha sette spartimenti: Tre sono I quadretti maggiori, e Quattro I minori. Nel quadretto maggiore di mezzo  lAssunta con molti Angioli, che spargono fiori. Nel quadrettino allato in Cornu Evangelii evvi Tobbiolo, lAngiolo, e il Pesce. VI. Segue dalla medesima parte altro quadretto maggiore, ove  dipinta la Vergine Santissima genuflessa in terra, il Padre Eterno al disopra, e dale bande Angioli, che la corteggiano; giciono in terra nudi colle sole fasce alle parti verende Adamo, ed Eva, secondo che verisimilmente si giudica. VII. Nel quadrettino, che segue in cima del grado, v una Donna, che scrive, e si crede essere una Sibilla, siccome pure nedue quadrettini in Cornu Epistolae sembrano espresso due sibille, e nel quadretto maggiore posto fra essi,  dipinta la Nunziata. VIII. Sopra questi gradi si colloca nella Festa di S. Pier Martire un Tabernacolo assai leggiadro alto un braccio in circa di fino intaglio, e doratura, lavoro forse del medesimo Maestro Antonio detto il Carota, dentro al quale  incassata una Macchinetta di bronzo dorato, nel cui mezzo  la Statuetta di S. Pier Martire col cultello in capo, e colla spade ficcata nellomero destro, e colla palma nella mano destra. Nella superior parte della Macchinetta vi sono le lettere N.I. e alquanto pi su evvi un A, e altre lettere, che non (285) si leggono. Il mettersi a interpetrare queste lettere,  lo stesso, che il voler far da indovno. Il Tabernacolo ha i suoi sportellini, nel destro dequali per di dentro  dipinto S. Gio. Batista, nel sinistro S. Tobbia, e comecch v il millesimo, cio 1510 per questo penso, che anche le pitture degradi, che paiono della medesima, mano, non sieno di Domenico Ghirlandaio, come molti vogliono, ma di alcuno detre suoi Figli David, Benedetto, Ridolfo, poich Domenico mor nel 1493. A pi della base della macchinetta  scolpito il martirio di S. Pier martire, nella stessa guise che si vede dipinto nel quadretto del grado descritto di sopra. IX. In questOratorio dedicato alla Vergine, che per chiamasi di Santa Maria del Bigallo, si venerano come contitolari s. Pier Martire, e S. Tobbia, come accennano le tre pitture del grado superiore: onde, solennenmente vi si celebra la Festa della Assunzione, la Festa di S. Pier Martire, e la Festa di S. Tobbia il giorno della Domenica 3 di Settembre, quando la Chiesa pone nel Divino Ufizio il libro della Storia del medesimo. In esso giorno adunque si fa la sua Festa, cominciando da i primi Vespri, con rito di doppio di prima Classe. X. La Festa per, che con maggior pompa dellaltre si solennizza,  quella di S. Pier Martire, poich dicesi essere stato lAutore dellinstituto del Bigallo, ed avere in questo angolo principalmente predicato contro lEresia dePaterini, vedendosi due dipinture molto antiche, di mano (credesi) di Taddeo Gaddi sopra gli archi della parte laterale dellOratorio, in una delle quali predica, e nellaltra consegna gli Stendardi a 12 Uomini (che furon detti i 12 Buoni Uomini del Bigallo) per combattere contro i detti Eretici. Sopra i Paterini compose gi alcune bella Lezioni il Signor Dottore Giovanni Lami, da me con piacere udite nellAccademia della Crusca. Uno dementovati Stendardi conservasi in Santa Maria Novella frallaltre venerabili Reliquie: per altro non pare a taluno (286) essere lantico, ma altro rifatto su quell modello: il suddetto Stendardo  bianco con croce rossa, la quale piglia tutta lestensione di esso, e con orlo rosso intorno intorno, ed  il simile al palio, che si pone per premio nella corsa deCavalli, salvo che  pi piccolo, e non ha striscia. Nella pittura suddetta le bandiere non son fatte cos, ma si pu supporre una libert pittoresca. E fama che gli altri undici si serbassero nel Bigallo, e andassero male in alcuna delle piene, in cui moli antichi libri ancora perissero; e in fatti in cattivo stato ridotto, e dalla belletta gusto si vede alcuno di essi, che pot alla violenza dellacque ritogliersi(?). XI. Quattro sono i Cappellani, che ufiziano lOratorio, e dipendono da un Proposto. Oltre agli oblighi delle Messe piane, son tenuti a cantare tre messe la Settimana, il Luned de Morti, il Gioved della Pace, e il Sabato della Madonna. Lobbligo della Messa della pace dicesi lasciato da Mone Fantini Taverniere, o Vinattiere mosso dagli avvenimenti funesti delle civili discordie. XII. Ma perch il suddetto numero di Cappelanni riuscirebbe scarso per le tre Feste solenni accennate, vi sono altri Preti fino al numero di 12 che allora intervengono, e in altre Feste di non tanta solennit ne intervengono otto, talch questo Oratorio viene ad avere quasi una Collegiata di non cos leggier conto, se si consideri lUfiziatura continovata delle Messe, e del Coro, che ab antico  quivi stabilit, in vigore, de lasciti delle pi, e divote Persone. XIII. La Compagnia di Santa Maria del Bigallo ebbe origine della carit, e cura degli Spedali: quella della Misericordia dal raccogliere i Morti, e dar loro Sepoltura, specialmente in tempo di peste. Erano da prima unita, ma poi furono separate, e quella della Misericordia dal Bigallo pass alla Chiesa di S. Cristofano, e quindi al luogo, dove di presente, che era prima la Residenza del Magistrato de i Pupilli. Il Migliore (287) tratta prima della Misericordia veechia, poi della nuova, onde da esso, e da altri documenti la sua industriosa instancabile diligenza potr assembrare sicure notizie, da formare una, o pi aggradevoli, e utili Lezioni. XIV. Per ultimo le trasmetto la copia duna Cartella, che  appesa nellOratorio di caratteri doro antichi, che essendo logori prima che si dileguassero affatto, fu avvedutamente ordinate, che si rifiorissero, ma non so precisamente in qual tempo. Ella  scritta in un quadro di legno con cornice dorata alto un braccio in circa, e nella parte superiore finisce in un triangolo, nel quale  dipinto un Ges rito colle gambe nel sepolcro, e colle braccia aperte, e dietro ad esso  la Croce, sulla quale par, che stia appoggiato: quel che  scritto nel quadro dice cos: AL NOME DI DIO AMEN. QUEST E LA CONPAGNIA MAGIORE FATTA EDIFICATA PER NOBILE SAN PIETRO MARTIRE AD ONORE E REVERENZIA DELLA NOSTRA GLORIOSA MADRE VERGINE MARIA NELL ANNO MCCXLIIII IL DI DELLA SENSIONE E FA DIRE ONGNI GIOVEDI LA MESSA DELLA PACE E CHI E DI QUESTA CONPANGNIA A TRE AN.

XV. (288) La parte opposta, o dir vogliamo il rovescio  tutto dipinto, essendovi nel triangolo la Madonna nel mezzo col Bambino in collo, alla cui destra sta S. Pier Martire con un giglio in mano, e alla sinistra S. Franesco, che tiene un libro. Nello spazio sottoposto del quadro, S. Pier Martire (dietro al quale  il frate suo Compagno) consegna lo Stendardo ad uno, che  inginocchiato asuoi piedi in atto di ricerverlo, e gli altri cogli Stendardi gi ricevuti sta ritti a dirimpetto con abito talare, ma di diversi colori. Tutta questa pittura pare della scuola di Giotto, cio di alcuno desuoi Scolari, e qui ne diamo una copia. XVI. Parlando daltra pittura consimile, che  sopra uno degli Archi, nominai lo Stendardo, che si conserva in Santa Maria Novella, aggiungo ora, che  di tela rada di lino, che rassomiglia il filondente, ed  rattoppato. Nulla dimeno vi ha chi non crede esser lantico. Avrei da dirle alcune altre cose da me osservate, ma gliele portr un giorno comunicare in voce. Son con vero ossequio: Di Casa 5 Maggio 1755 Suo Devotissimo Servitor Angio Maria Ricci. XVII. Degli Scrittori soprallodati, pregiatissimi per vero dire sono i documenti, e insieme utilissimi, onde stabilire la verit della Storia. Ma perch sopra alcune cose riferite da i ricordati Scrittori ne possono nascere gravi dubbiezze, mi far dal punto il pi difficile, ma essenziale, qual  lorigine delle due Compagnie, vale a dire della Compagnia maggiore di Maria Vergine chiamata poi del Bigallo, e della Compagnia detta della Misericordia vecchia, standosi forte in dubbio, se dal principio queste due Compagnie fossero una sola, o almeno, come io credo, tra se presto unitesi, (289) poich amendue riconoscevano per Fondatore San Pier Martire. Per lopinione negative son il suddetto Ambrogi, e Rosselli, e molti altri: per laffirmativa trovasi Leopoldo del Migliore nella Firenze Illustrata, dove dice a c. 78 come segue, E qui si deve avvertire, prima di passer avanzi, che doppo questunione come daltri dodici spedali raccomandati sotto alla medesima cura segu il dividersene le ragioni in due Corpi destinti, uno sotto il medessimo nome, e titolo di S. Maria del Bigallo alias di San Pier Martrie, e laltro di S. Maria della Misericordia, ambidue al governo di Capitani. Il che sperimentatosi con lungo andare uno servare, e tor di vita la virt, corroborante lunioni delle cose, e per tale conosciutosi da Padri, arrivata che f la Repubblica felicemente allAnno 1425 in cui par pi che in altro tempo, i Fiorentini non combattuti dalleiterne, e disastrose brighe di Guerra sostero intenti fuor di modo a riaccomodar lo stato loro, e linterne direzioni della Citt appoggiate al giudiziio delle Leggi, si deliber in Senato, che le predette due Compagnie si riunistero insieme sotto un medesimo nome di S. Maria del Bigallo, da governarsi da otto Capitani risendenti collegialmente a guisa di Magistrato, e che un segno esteriore ne fosse lArmi loro ridotte in uno Scudo solo diviso per lo lungo in parte, da una la Croce rossa in Campo nero con un F, e dallaltra un M doro dalle bande, e dallaltra un Gallo bianco in azzurro con lettere sotto S.M.B. XVIII. Ora questa opinione io penso di appigliarmi sul riflesso, che cos meglio si dichiarao parecchie cose difficili, come per esempio le pitture di S. Pier Martire fatta da Taddeo Gaddi nella facciata esteriore dellOratorio, dalla banda, che guarda San Giovanni, delle quali con maggiore facilit ne intendiamo il fine di chi le ffece colorire, cio la Compagnia in onore del Santo suo fondatore, laddove se ci allontaniamo dal parere del Migiore, e vogliamo distinte, e separata le Compagnie, il Bigallo non avrebbe potuto far lavorare dal Gaddi le dette dipinture, mentrech non prima dellanno 1425 divent il Bigallo unico Padrone di questo luogo, n poteva comandare tal (290) fattura sopra casa non sua, ma che era della Compagnia della Misericordia, e per ogni altro Santo si arebbe fatto da essa dipignere: In tal guise ancora noi combiniamo la variet degli Scrittori nellassengare lanno della fondazione del Bigallo, volendo alcuni che fosse il 1240 ed altri il 44 che se giudichiamo le due suddette Compagnie neprimi anni unite, possiamo stabilire nel 40 prinicpiata una di esse, ed ivi pure laltra nel 44 e sullo stesso sistema troviamo la cagione perch la Signoria nel 1352 per contratto rogato da Ser Piero di Ser Grifo ne 28 di Giugno, desse al Bigallo, terreno per fabbricarsi la sua Residenza l vicino a S. Bartolo al Corso, done se ne deduce forte congettura, che appunto in quellanno 52 o in quell torno si separassero, giusta il Migliore, le due Compagnie, altrimenti siamo costretti a dire, che la Compagnia del Bigallo per cento, e pi anni non avesse mai avuto casa in Firenze. E se abbiamo detto di sopra, che I Capitani di essa si radunaveano ora in un luogo della Citt, ed ora in altro, da ci non sembra buona illuzione il dire, che non avessero propria Residenza, imperciocch andavano in varie Chiese, o di loro dipendenza, o da essi beneficiate in certe occasioni di fare varie provvisioni; ed io ne ho una presso di me fatta dadetti Capitani in Santa Maria sul Prato, che dice come segue: 1297 15 Aug. Nos Mazzottus Bacherelli, Bartolus Ugolini, Ser Ciprianus 4 Riccomanni, Ser Guido Spadaccii, Folchardinus Bonsignori, Ubaldinus Ardinghelli, Guido Ramaglianti, &amp;amp; Vieri Arrussi Rectores, sive Capitanei maioris Societatis B.

Ego Rusticus Not. Q. Ugonis. XIX. Altro dubbio ora ci occorre da illustrare, riguardante lOratorio, che non  assai certo su qual terreno, e quando fosse fabbricato, dicendo a questo proposito lAmbrogi, che la Compagnia della Misericordia antichissima, comper alcune Case da Baldinaccio degli Adimari sopra la Piazza di San Giovanni, e su di esse edificasse ella il suo Oratorio, e Residenza: ma Leopoldo del Migliore a c. 81 diversamente la discorre come appresso, in su la cantonata  lOratorio della Misericordia vecchia, situate appunto dove fu gi la Torre del Guardamorto, e la Stanza pubblica allesposizione deCadaveri, e dal medesimo ivi dicesi, che la detta Torre rovinata che su, fosse conceduta dalla Repubblica a San Pietro da Verona per trasferirvi la sua novella Compagnia, da I cui Capitani fu il luogo ridotto ad uso di Oratorio, e di Residenza. Uniformamente al Migliore scrisse pure il Rosselli nella sua memoria, tendo egli per cosa certa, che sopra il sito della suddetta Torre fosse eretto lOratorio, ed al sentiment di amendue favorevole sarrebbe la pianta del sotterraneo, avente muraglie grossissime, ed un barbacane stupendo, i quali non furono murati certamente per servizio dellOratorio, che essendo di mediocre altezza, non richiedeva somiglianti fondamenta. E per dirre alcunch dellanno della erezione dellOratorio del Bigallo, noteremo qui labbaglio preso primieramente da parecchi, che scrisseroessersi principiata la detta Fabbrica nel 1240 o al pi 44 posciach abbiamo da Ricordano Malespini a pag 123 e da Giovanni Villani a pag. 177 che solamente nel 1248 cadesse detta Torre, e le parole del Villani sono le sequenti, Ancora mostrarono maggiore ampiezza per cagione, che eGuelfi faceano di loro molto capo alla Chiesa, et Duomo di S. Giovanni (292) et tutta la buona gente usava quivi la Domenica mattina, e faceanuisi molti matrimoni. Quando vennero a disfare la fortezza deGuelfa (cio le Torri) intra laltre unalta, et bella Torre, che era in su la Piazza di S. Giovanni allentrare nel Corso degli Adimari, la quale si chiamava la Torre del Guardamorto, perch anticamente tutta la buona gente che moriva, si seppelliva a S. Giovanni, i Ghibellini facendo tagliar da pi della detta Torre (da Niccola Pisano) s la fecero puntellare per modo, che quando si mettesse fuoco nepuntelli cadesse sopra il Duomo di San Giovanni, et arsi i puntelli, come piacque a Dio, et a Messer Santo Giovanni, cadde la Torre per lo mezzo della Piazza, et apparve manifestamente, che la Torre si ravvolse, e schifo di non cadere, dove haveano ordinato, la qual Torre era alta CXX braccia. Quindi si fa ragione, che non solamente vicinissima fosse la detta Torre a S. Giovanni, ma che non prima del 1248 anno della vendetta sacrilege deGhibellini, non poteva il Bigallo aver principiato il suo edifizio sulle rovine delle Torri, la cui demolizione arrec a Niccola Pisano lode di grande Architetto. E dale suddette Notizie chiaro appare lo sbaglio di un Diario, che trovo tra le Scritture del Rondinelli, che scrisse, 1411 si fabbrica lOratorio del Bigallo sul canto del Corso deBrigliai. Oltredich il lavoro esterno di questo Oratorio o sieno le colonnette, o larco, o i rilievi, dichiarano manifestamente questo esser fabbrica di maniera pi antica. XX. Quando poi la Compagnia di Santa Maria del Bigallo, e della Misericordia, cessato il titolo dei Capitani, diventasse un cospicuo Magistrato di Firenze, il cui principale ufizio  la sollecita cura, e governo degli Abbandonati, nella prima lezione ne siamo andati istruiti, ma notar qui mi giova, che nellantico ancora dalla Repubblica furono al Bigallo raccomandati i Fanciulli, e Fanciulle o smarrite o derelitte, come ne parlano varie Provvisioni del Comune, (293) e lo Statuto Fiorentino sotto la rubric 117 del libro 3 con le seguenti parole: Quicumque invenerit aliquos Pueros, vel puellas vagantes sine custodia, reneatur representare, &amp;amp; assignare in Platea Orti S. Michaelis, vel apud Domam Misericordie ufficiali deputato per dictum Commune; e da Fra Domenico da Corella cos ne fu scritto circa al 1460 nel suo Theotocon: Unde pusilla mihi Domus est adeunda Marie Proxima que nomen Commiserantis habet. Hec tenet ambiguo Pueros errore vagantes Ne patria pereat nescia turba laris. Tuta sed hec fido maneat sub culmine, donec Reddantur patribus pignora chara suis. Talis enim nostra mos hic servatur in Urbe Preferri religuis que pietate solet. XXI. E gi schiariti i prinicipali punti della Storia, non sar certamente disconveniente cosa laccennare qui per fine alcune dipinture intra lasciate dal Sig. Proposto Dottore Angelo Maria Ricci, perch non pertinenti al suo Oratorio, dove Egli  capo di una piccolo, ma riguardevole Collegiata. E per consideramo una pittura grande sopra il Portone al di fuori dipinta a fresco, rappresentante in varie, e belle attitudini, dove molti Fanciulli smarriti, e dove delle Madri chi afflitta per la perdita del figlio, e chi in aria allegra per vederselo restituire daCapitani del Bigallo, veggendosi in tale dipintura molte case, e Torri alluso di quetempi, cio del 1444 come trovasi notato al lib. X pag. 8 nellArchivio del medesimo Bigallo, dove si legge anche il nome del Pittor e dice, 1444 1 Iunii Capitanei S. Marie virginis, &amp;amp; Misericordie del Bigallo &amp;amp;c ordinano pagarsi diversi obblighi del loro Spedale etc. Item Piero Chellino Pictori proresto totius sue Picture facte in Domo habitationis Captineorum in facie exteriori. Nellandito dellUdienza sonovi alquante Pitturre vetuste, come quelle che occupano tutta la parete addirimpetto alla Porta del Magistrato, ma (294) cos annerite, e guaste, che non  sperabile larrivare ad intenderle: sul piano della scala, che con due braccia conduce al piano superior, vedesi un Cristo ritto(?) nel Sepolcro, colle braccia aperte, tenente nel seno una moltitudine di gente per esprimere la Misericordia, e sotto due Cartelli di caratieri gottici, che dicono: O VOI GENTE, CHE PER VIA PASSATE, INTRATE DENTRO, E QVI RIGVARDATE IL MIO FIGLVOLO IN CROCE POSTO PE VOSTRI PECCATI  COS MORTO. SE VOI DE PECCATI VI PENTETE MISERICORDIA DA LVI AVRETE. O PECCATORI PERCH NON PIAGIETE I VOSTRI PECCATI CHE QVI VEDETE MORTO IL NOSTRO SIGNOR GES CRISTO CHE PER VOI SALVARE FV CROCIFISSO QVALVNQVE COLLVI VORR CONCORDIA PRIEGHI LA MADRE DI MISERICORDIA. XXII. E a manritta di questa porta viene una parimente antichissima pittura a fresco, ed una Figura giagantesca della Misericordia espresso in una Persona ammantata di Piviale con Mitra tonda in capo, e Stolone fino a i piedi, nella quale Stola veggonsi alcuni ovati, in cui sono effigiate le Opere della Misericordia con lettere longobarde. Questa figura sta in aria in atto maestoso di padrona, sopra a Firenze dipintale sotto col Popolo inginocchioni, e chi bramasse sapere qual fosse il secondo Cerchio della Citt, o veda quivi delineato. Il Pittore di questa Tavola spieg la sua idea con le sequenti lettere mezze gottiche, ma rifiorite sullantiche, e dicono; OMNIS MISERICORDIA FACIET LOCVM VNICVIQVE SECVNDVM MERITVM OPERVM SVORVM, ET SEVNDVM INTELLECTVM PEREGRINATIONIS ILLIVS ANNO MCCCLII. (295) Uscendo da questo loggetta a man destra sono nel muro numero sei arpioni alti dal piano degli scalini due in tre braccia, dequali sha certa tradizione, che servissero per attaccarvi la Cattedra, quando San Pier Martire predicava in su questa Piazza; della qual cosa non avendo altra autenticazione, che il detto di qualche Persona antica, mi baster di averlo qui accennato, lasciando a ciascuno giudicare come gli piace. E sua Porta dellUdienza, oltre larme deGranduchi evvi un Cartello contenente a caratteri doro queste lettere: SERENISS. COSMO MAGNO D. HETRVRIAE XII. VIRI CVM CERTIS PIETATIS MINISTERIIS ET PVPRIS DERELICTIS CVM ALIQVA ECCLESIAST. DIGNIT. PERSONA. COLLIGENDIS ET CVRANDIS PRAEFECTI. XXIII. E qui mi si conceda di por fine a questa istoria, col riferire smmariamente tutti gli anni delle Pestilenze in Firenze, e suo Contado, e per conseguente i tanti prodigi di carit operati dalla Compagnia nostra in quelle stragi, e fuesti apparati di morte. La prima vi succeed nel 1325 cagionata dalla Guerra di Altopascio, la seconda nel 1340 nella quale i morti furono il sesto de i Cittadini, la maggior parte nobili; sette anni dopo segu la terza, e nellanno seguente 1348 venne la pestilenza chiamata la Peste grande, la quale uccise centomila anime, nel cui numero annoversari Giovanni Villani famoso Storiografo, e Matteo fratello di Giovanni ci fu tolto dalla peste del 1363 e due altre ne furono in quellinfelice secolo, cio nel 1374 e nel 1383. Ritorn nel 1400 detta la peste deBianchi, che erano certe Compagnie, che andavano pellegrinando, e vi restarono quasi tutti morti; la nona fu nel 1411 e la decima venne nel 1417 con 16 mila morti. Altra di pochissima durata fuvvi nel 22 e somiglianti nel 30 e nel 37. Una poi chiamata lAnguinata nel 1449 fu grande, massimamente nel Contado, a questa succeede nel 65 la XVI e la XVII (296) nel 79 nella quale trovatosi Marsilio Ficino, scrisse quell celebre libro intitolato: La cura della Peste, contenente ottime istruzioni. Di tre altre nel 95, 98, e 1509 non ne abbiamo particolarit: fierissima per, e lunghissima fu quella del 1525 sino al 1527 dicendone il Varchi, fece strage quasi di Uomini infiniti. Dopo questa vise la Citt centotr anni libera da tal flagella, quando nel 1630 il contagioso male scopertosi a Milano, e picchiate le Porte a Bologna, a gran passi venne a Firenze, ed in tutto il tempo del male occupatissima fu nesuoi esercizi di Misericordia la Compagnia, che in quetempi addimandavasi, come oggi, la Misericordia nuova, la quale si guadagn tanta venerazione, che passando per le vie, anche terminata la peste, sentivasi rimbombare di lode laria. Viva viva la Compagnia della Misericordia. Non fu per questa Pestilenza lultima, avvegnach nel 1633 facesse ritorno, ma dale diligenze del Granduca Ferdinando, che mise tutta la Citt in quarantine, presto spar, e per vero dire, dagli esempi posteriori non pu negarsi, che la salute dellItalia nostra non si riconosca dallamore, potere, e diligenza dePrincipi.",

        "content"  : "Translation: Jorge Gomez Historical News of the Florentine Churches: First Three Lessons of the Madonna of Orsanmichele First Lesson: There are many miraculous images of Mary in Florence, among which the most glorious was always that of Or S. Michele. This was probably due to the multiplicity of the centuries, or because of the quantity of miracles, or the quality of the honors. I would like to address all three of these privileges here in this lesson. But first, I would like to speak of his sovereign Tabernacle and the sublimity of its design and the marbles richness surpassing all human estimation. Moving me to do this is the lack of much valuable information left out by Francesco Bocchi, Giovanni Cinelli, and Filippo Baldinucci, who all wrote about this Oratory. Furthermore, Giorgio Vasari could have written much more about it in the life of Andrea Orcagna. However, I will begin by reporting what he briefly wrote, as follows: Soon after having the men of the Company of Or S. Michele put together many denari of alms, and goods that were donated to that Madonna after the plague of 1348, they resolved to make around her a chapel, or Tabernacle, not only carved in marble but also from other precious stones of immense value, like mosaic and bronze, as much as could be desired. So much so that by labor and by matter every other work was advanced until the point that the grand work was made. Being the most excellent of that age, all the work was given to Orcagna. He made so many designs until one finally pleased the patrons, and they deemed it better than all the others; whereby they entrusted the work to him, they left everything to his judgment, and to his advice. He then gave several carving masters from several places all the decorative things that needed to be done and waited with his brother (Nardo di Cione) to produce all the figures of the work. When everything was finished, he had them bricked up, and made them together very considerably without mortar with spliced copper bars, so that the polished and clean marbles would not get stained, which he did so well with profit and honor, that to those that came after him and considered his work, it seems that the whole chapel of Orcagna was quarried from a single piece of marble due to its unity and joints. And although the chapel is of a Gothic manner, it holds the first place among the things of that genre and time due to its grace and proportion, and especially the composition of large and small figures, the angels, and the half-relief prophets placed so well around the Madonna. The casting of the diligently cleaned bronze enclosures is also marvelous, which, going around the whole work, encloses and squeezes it together so that it remains no less vigorous, strong, and beautiful than in all the other parts. But how much he worked to show the subtlety of his ingenuity in that great time can be seen in a large half-relief narrative in the rear part of said Tabernacle. This half-relief contains figures one and a half braccia (about 100 cm) long which depicted the twelve Apostles looking at the Madonna while surrounded in an almond tree by two angels in the sky. In one of those Apostles, he portrayed himself as old, with a shaved beard and a hood wrapped around his flat head and round face. In addition to this he wrote these words underneath in marble: Andreas Cionis Pictor Florentinus Oratorii Archimagister exstitit bujus 1359. Up to this point Vasari said nothing about the variety of precious marbles and the very rare stones, nothing about the many beautiful figures and statues, and nothing of the mysteries portrayed in the bas-reliefs; on the contrary, by mentioning the blessed ascended Virgin Mary, he makes a mistake by saying that the apostles look at the Madonna ascended to heaven. There are two low reliefs (not one) divided into two pictures, the first of which above shows the Ascended Virgin surrounded by Angels among some trees worked with rare finesse at the bottom of the scene. In the second section from below, which has nothing to do with the one above, we see the dead Madonna surrounded by the Apostles, and it is true that Orcagna portrayed himself, but not yet old, as the aforementioned Writer said since the good craftsman died in 1389 at age of 6o. Therefore in 1359, the year in which the Tabernacle was completed, he must have been 30 years old without any more. Here, I would like to start making up for the things of this Chapel that the writers left out. First, I would like to notice the beautiful design of this work with its measurements made by Orcagnas own hand. Even after 400 years, the very well preserved design may be seen in the famous Library of ancient manuscripts of the former Senator Carlo Strozzi. Thanks to the courtesy of Mr. Carlo Tommaso, his worthy grandson, we have a copper engraving of the design. Now coming to the exact description, in the corner of the loggia towards the middle, the reader will see a niche adorned with various marbles, as high as a step and three braccie (about 200 cm) wide. This niche goes around the Tabernacle covered by a domed grandstand and surrounded by a rich balustrade, resting at the end of a staircase also made of marble. In the four corners of the gate worked with bronze arabesques there are four pedestals, which support a spiral column, on whose top there is a statue representing an Angel. These columns are four and three-quarter braaccie high, and the Angels are one and one fourth. Then after this noble balustrade, inside rises the much-commended Tabernacle supported by four pillars, each of which has nine columns that are three and a sixth braccie high, and a quarter large, between each of them you can see hard stones shining with an abundance of lapis lazuli  not only in the pillars, but in the bases and in the arches of the Dome, as well. Twelve are of the Prophets, which are one braccia high, and half turned on the architrave, each having a sign that expresses the virtues of the Virgin Mary. Then there are four spiers made in the Gothic style, six and an eighth braccie high without the base, which in the middle they place the dome six and a quarter high, and in the highest of it is an Angel two braccie tall. The vague arabesques and the very fine marble leaves are extended everywhere in such a manner that they are considered miraculous. Finally, eight mysteries are represented in the base of the grandstand in graceful bas-reliefs. These are of the Nativity of Mary, her Presentation in the Temple, the Marriage with Saint Joseph, the Annunciation, the Epiphany, the Circumcision, and in the eighth, according to the ancient tradition, an Angel who brings to the Virgin a palm leaf as an announcement of Christs death. In the middle of such a remarkable grandstand above the rich altar surrounded by beautiful relief angels there is a painting, famous and adored all around the world, of the image of the Virgin Mary, called the Madonna of Or S. Michele, the most powerful advocate of the Florentines. Giulio Mancini, a modern Tuscan author, argues in one of his essays about paintings that this image was painted by the Sienese painter, Ugolino di Nerio. I will report here a scholarly defense from Baldinucci written during the life of Orcagana. It states as follows: We will add lastly that the modern writer, of whom we spoke a little while ago, believed that Vasari made a mistake to have affirmed that the sacred image of the Virgin Mary, which adorned this Tabernacle, was made by the hand of Ugolino who died in 1349, being that the image was painted in 1284. It did not seem likely to him that in 1284 Ugolino could have been well educated in painting and that he could have painted such a work. Furthermore, the style of the painting was more akin to a Byzantine painting than to a contemporary Florentine one. Finally, the image is wooden, and Vasari says that the image that originally hung on the column in the loggia was made by Ugolino. But if we consider well, the Authors argument cannot hold. First, Vasari in his first edition says that Ugolino died not in 1349 but in 1339, and in both the first and second editions he states that Ugolino died in a decrepit age. Therefore, if we count well, in 1284 he could have been at least 30 or 35 years old, and consequently in the prime of his work. Secondly, Vasari says in both editions and in open letters that Ugolino worked in a Byzantine style and that he always stubbornly kept to these ancient ways, even though many painters of his time - including Giotto himself  worked in a much better manner. For this reason, we must say that the painting is the hand of Ugolino. That she may be on wood or on the wall may then be typo by the printer. Instead of writing he made the image of our Lady FOR a pillar of the loggia he wrote IN a pillar. And even when Vasari had said so, we still find that he and many of those who wrote about the lives of painters, used to say that a painting was made in a church, but it is not necessarily made for said church. Thus, Vasari having said this, Ugolino making Our Woman in the pillar does not prevent us from being able to believe that he meant that Ugolino had made the image into a wooden painting to get the measurements right and then for that panel to be placed on the pillar. The doubt then seems to be reduced to a mere cavillation. Having accomplished this and having the obligation to trace all the most noteworthy things in this chapel, I will go on to discuss the singular privileges of the Most Holy Image. I must observe that ascribing to the painting its performance of sensational miracles to the year 1292  despite being the one noted by Giovanni Villani  is incorrect. I find that the distinguished Company of the Madonna of Or. S. Michele had begun in 1291, which would presuppose that before some time the miraculous painting was already in great place on the pillar. Therefore, it seems more likely that the holy painting was placed on the pillar soon after 1284, the year the loggia was built. Hence it is now about 460 years old, counting only from 1291, the start of the company. And here I would like to make a not contemptuous reflection on a marvelous combination of two sanctuaries which were formed at the same time and became famous all over the world. For precisely at this time, when in our image, heaven opened a source in Florence or rather a river of grace, the angels brought the House of Nazareth from Palestine to Italy. And if Pontiffs, Emperors, Kings, and Princes made the Lauretan temple magnificent, the Florentine Republic alone, as we shall see later, not wanting to spend immense treasures, built the Madonna of Or. S. Michele, one of the most splendid and superb churches. As the Book of the Reformations stated Un fiat Beatissime Virgini Marie S. Michaelis in Orto templum splendidissimum, &amp;amp; supra modum splendidissimum. Pilgrims came to the Holy House of Loreto from all parts of the world, and even people from different parts of Europe came with very large offerings and vows to venerate our Image, thus writing to Pope Urban V in 1364 Ad quod sere concurrunt homines de variis Mundi partibus. And after such a beautiful digression, returning to our Image, I must not forget to mention things about the Company of Or. S. Michele, like the most authoritative document demonstrating the antiquity of the miraculous painting. There is no better way of doing this than by summarily reporting the old chapters of the statutes written in the fourteenth century, and communicated to me by the scholar and courteous Mr. Domenico Maria Manni, the prologue of which is as follows: In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. And to the honor and reverence of Our Lord Jesus Christ, and of His Most Holy Mother Madonna Santa Maria always Virgin, and of Blessed Santo Michele Arcangelo, &amp;amp; of Blessed Santo Lorenzo, and of the whole Court of Heaven, and to the honor and reverence of the Holy Church of Rome, &amp;amp; of Our Lord the Pope, and of his Cardinal Signori Friars, and of the Bishop of Florence, and to the status, honor, and maintenance of the City of Florence, and its district, for the good and consolation of the Poor. These are the Chapters, and the orders of those, which are and will be of the said Company, which was begun in the years of the Incarnation of Our Lord Jesus Christ, MCCLXXXI. the day of Blessed Santo Lorenzo in the month of August. Three writers penned forty chapters in the confraternitys statutes that confirm the high veneration that different peoples had for this institution. In the first one we must recall the manner which was used to console the hordes of peoples who asked to be enrolled in the company. This confraternity employed a notary obligated to solemnly stand at the desk every day to register the names of the brothers and sisters who were enrolling. However, since there were too many to accommodate, the step was taken to have foreigners and those from the countryside registered alongside citizens as soon as they entered through the citys gates. And with a rare example we find in chapter XXXVII that even the dead were ascribed to the company as long as one brought the name of the deceased to the notary. As written in the book, his soul became a participant in the suffrages of which grace was given. The policy was marked with the confraternitys seal of the Annunciation and with these words written around it: Sigillum Societatis Virg. Marie Sancti Mich. in orto de Florentia. I will discuss everything that the company did under the Loggia in the second chapter, but here I will instead talk about the sacred pillar, since in those early times of the statutes creation the Oratory was not mentioned. In every evening, lauds were sung by the Laudesi brothers. During the eve of the feasts of the Lord, of Mary, of the Apostles, and of the Holy Advocates of the City, these lauds were sung with greater solemnity, making a general illumination of the whole Loggia in the preceding night. On all Sundays of the year and other solemn days, a sermon was delivered in the Loggia by preachers chosen by the Clergy to preach in the late afternoon hours, after Vespers. Throughout the day, four assiduous guards were kept at the pillar and then two at night to receive offerings of wax, clothing, money, and alms, which were more abundant since they were made at night. Finally, in the third chapter it is pertinent to talk about the examples of charity and piety that the brothers gave to the city and to the county. Most devout in the Company were the processions of the Carmine and the Nonziata, which each year visited two of the following churches: S. Marco, S. Spirito, S. Croce, and S. Maria Novella. The order would restart every three years with the offering of a one-ounce candle for each brother. Each Monday six masses were celebrated in various churches for the deceased brothers. This was done so that each dead brother would have at least one mass said for him during the year, in which an officer of the company had to attend and pay twelve coins to the Priest. However, the most common gifts were general alms, besides the daily ones, and which took place in all the districts of Florence and its county. Indeed, it was the happiest day of the whole year for the poor, among which were included all the monasteries, hospitals, prisons, and hermits, being found in the books of the company, as charitable donations sometimes reached the sum of 37,000 lire, which helped the fame of Or. S. Michele and its company grow. And, as I have done in the books other chapters, allow me to quote the title which can be read at the beginning of another book, called Green Champion, as follows: Codex bonorum piissima Societatis Gloriosissime Virg. Maria S. Michaelis in Orto, merito in toto Orbe re &amp;amp; fama memoratissima, ob suum devotissimum Oratorium sub famoso Templo , ac supramodnm Eminentissimo, eius nomine fundatum pariter &amp;amp; sonstrutum. By having invoked the miraculous image of the Madonna of Orsanmichele, located on the pillar in the loggia, we may now refer to the multiple miracles it performed with so much abundance. Giovanni Villani interrupted the flow of his chronicle with the story of the paintings amazing powers, writing: On the 3rd of July 1292, great and open miracles began to be shown in the city of Florence for a figure of S. Maria painted in one of the loggias pillars of Or. S. Michele, where wheat is sold, the sick are healed, people are captivated, and miracles were performed in large quantities. S. Antonio affirms the same in the third part of his story, as follows: Eodem anno (1292.) mense Iulii patrata sunt quadam miracula Florentia ex quadam Figura Virginis Gloriosa, qua erat in pariete picta atrii, seu horti S. Michaelis, ubi tunc forum erat frument, &amp;amp; aliorum bladorum. Nam concepta devotione ab omnibus ad Figuram illam infirmis devote orantibus, plures sanati sunt exvariis languoribus, claudi erecti, contracti sanati, &amp;amp; obsessi a doemonibus liberati. In the same year (1292), the image of the Glorious Virgin that appears on the wall of the court of Orsanmichele, the market for corn and grain, performed a miracle in the month of July. Answering the devout prayers of the people, the sick were healed, the lame walked, and those possessed by demons were freed.] Sozomeno from Pistoia wrote about this in his general history of the world, which is preserved in the library of the regular canons of the abbey of Fiesole. As Father Antonio Zaccaria writes about the aforementioned story: Anno 1292. Die 3. Mensis Iulii Figura picta B. Virginis Maria, qua erat in horto S. Michaelis fecit multa miracula sanando infirmos &amp;amp; elaudos, unde fuit maxima devotio totius populi &amp;amp; finitimorum, &amp;amp; tantum aucta est, quod singulis annis distribuebantur sex mille libbra, &amp;amp; usque ad hodiernum diem extat devotion In the year 1292. On the 3rd day of July the figure of the Blessed Virgin Mary, located in the garden of Orsanmichele, performed many miracles by healing the sick and the lame, and it is venerated to this day All the Tuscan writers speak of it this way, but none that I know of tell of how this miraculous painting was saved by Sig. Neri Abati in 1304 and thus was unharmed by the fire in Florence of that year, which burned not only the adjoining houses, but the loggia itself. Additional miracles that the painting performed can be observed in Orsanmicheles stained glass windows, which some believe were the first to be made in the city after the secret was brought to Florence from Flanders. The quantity and quality of the miracles performed by the Madonna of Orsanmichele provoked responses that I must report. The first derived from theologians and professors of divinity, who were not convinced of the powers of the painting or swayed by the stories they were told  but who were probably simply jealous of the devotion it received. They urged people to reconsider its power, which caused the Masters of Theology to be accused of envy over the pure zeal they were showing to the glory of God and Mary. St. Antonino (Bishop of Florence, 1446-1459) wrote about it in the third part of his story, scathingly rejecting the accounts of Giovanni Villani and of other writers. Antoninos words are as follows: Fratres autem Predicatores &amp;amp; Minores, quia parum fidei dabant dictis miraculis, Populus, qui leviter movetur, eis detrahebat, &amp;amp; obloquebatur contra eos, adscribens invidia, quod erat vera pietatis Because the Friars Preachers and Minors (Dominicans and Franciscans) properly gave little credence to the miracles which had been reported, the people (who were unpersuaded by them) drew away from the clerics and insulted them by claiming their protests were driven by envy. But the stupendous abundance of miracles contradicted the aforesaid critique. At all hours the painting attracted the impoverished and the sick, along with curious strangers who wished to witness supernatural events, and their prayers of thanks filled the air with a thousand blessings. So it was then that the Loggia, intended for the sale of grain, was instead frequently encumbered by the crowd of devotees, so much so that the Signoria was forced to close the loggia  but I am not sure of the year. It was then transformed into a church, but not without serious regret and opposition from several citizens of the Great Council, who lamented the alternations that compromised the beauty of the most majestic place in Florence, which we will describe in due course. The very large sums that were donated to the guardians of the pillar were the direct result of the many miracles performed there. I will now report on only one of these many rich offerings. It was the one that the Florentines made in 1348 (the year of the great plague) recorded in the ledgers kept by the captains of Or. S. Michele, which ascended to a sum of 35,000 gold florins that, as Matteo Villani reported, was an incredible treasure due to the value of the money then. This was an offering so large that none like it had ever been made to another sanctuary of its time. But since we have recalled the merits of this images antiquity and miracles, reason has it that we speak of the honors received both publicly and in private. To avoid recounting the long series of ordinations made by the Republic regarding the cult of our Lady, I have chosen some of the most memorable ones, which are high marks of honor to this Oratory, and will discuss other solicitudes of the Signoria in another lesson in order to place the Loggia alongside the most commendable works of Architecture, Sculpture, and Painting. The act that increased the devotion of the painting, along with the holy tabernacle, occurred when she was declared by the republic as a special advocate of the Florentines: the sound of the great bell, customarily rung to recognize grave resolutions, summoned people to the great Piazza dei Signori on the 13th of August 1365. A law was passed in 1366, soon after this proclamation, ordering every citizen to send a banner to Or. S. Michele and if he was a soldier, one light shield (targa). To this same end, governed by piety and following another law of 1386, the Churches Rectors and the Superiors of the Holiday of Ascension were expected to make an offering at the Altar, which on the same solemn day the Gonfalonier offered a gift of fruit at mid mass, serving as an example to all. Ever increasing the ardor of everyone to do new honors to Mary, he then gave votive offerings of wax figures portrayed naturally, being as tall as the living, with heads and hands, with hats, dresses, shapes, and every other ornament. As per the custom of those times, the Loggia was so filled that it was, as the proverb states, Sarebbonelleno mai tante quanti I Boti di Or. S. Michele - There are more votives in Orsanmichele than there are Hellenes in Greece  to which S. Antonino add, &amp;amp; in processi temporis est repletes locus imaginibus cereis (And as time went by, the room was filled with wax figures). Returning to the holy laws of the republic regarding the veneration and esteem of this valuable image, we must not ignore the one which required the men of the government to swear on the venerable altar of Or. S. Michele to directly administer public matters and attest the books of Remembrances (Recordanze) of those times. Each member made their public or private oaths solemnly, taking it for granted that severe punishments would be meted out to those with insincere intentions. An ancient statute can be found in Rubrica115 of book II which states that any oaths made beyond this altar would be declared null: Nullo modo valeat, neque observetur, nisi tale iuramentum praestitum fuerit coram B. Virgine, &amp;amp; Capitaeneis Or. S. Michaelis (In no way shall it be valid, nor observed, unless such an oath has been made before the Blessed Virgin and the Captains of Ortus S. Michael). And from a book of the Company of Or. S. Michele we have the following privilege: 1329, the Florentine Republic orders that whoever has killed any of his relatives, from whom the delinquent could have inherited from, he shall be stripped of this inheritance. A third of this inheritance will then go to the company of the Virgin Mary of Or. S. Michele, and the remainder to the Municipality of Florence. It was thought by the lords that the value of Or. S. Michele would increase by hosting exquisite concerts and a concourse for lauds which were said to be at the oratory every evening. The republic thus ordered in the law of 1388 that the musicians of the city, and the Sonatori di pifferi, and Viole players of the Palace, should come to Or. S. Michele on Saturdays and on solemn feasts, a custom which is still preserved today. And here I may be granted, although outside its place, to discuss two additional alms made by the Company of Or. S. Michele which can give light to the Florentine history and which I did not know about when I wrote about the chapters of the company above. I learned about these from Mr. Domenic Maria Manni, who found them in the same books: 1306, alms of 100 florins donated by Giovanna Romita da Signa and delivered by Chele Lapi, a Laudese singer from San Frediano. This is the same one from Signa who was beatified, and on page 49 of the book it says that the gift was for general maintenance or discretionary use. In the book of 1307, there is another alm from a resident of Fosse della Porta dellAlloro Oste, Giotto di Bondone, the distinguished painter who restored the art to its glory. And finally in praise of this Oratory, I will report some verses from the famous Fra Domenico from Coiella, a writer of the fifteenth century, no less famous for his theological works than for his poetic art, as noted by the scholarly author of the Delights of the Erudites in his tome of 1742, to whom we are able to give the print of the IV book of Elegies on Florentine churches to the aforementioned Author, where he says as follows: Attamen apparet longe spatiosior intus, Fulget ubi Sancta Matris imago Dei. Hans miro candore nitens complectitur arcus, Sculptilibus pollens undique marmoreis Quorum compages tanta contexitur arte, Ut fibi vix aliud par videatur opus (However, the interior appears far more spacious; It shines when the image of the Holy Mother of God shines. Hans embraces a gleaming rainbow The powerful marble statues on all sides Their structure is so tightly consolidated Hardly another pair of work to be seen) Second Lesson: The motives of great patrons to construct magnificent buildings made is to demonstrate their might and wealth. At the same time it is the solicitous commitment to increase their citys ornamentation and to contribute to the needs of its citizens. Such were the ends that the Florentine Republic had in mind when building the majestic and most splendid building of Or. S. Michele. It was the Florentines who had risen to great power by means of commerce and thus wanted to reveal to the whole world the splendor of their free state, and to give to its potentates a structure made even worthier by the many artistic riches installed inside it. One of the main ornaments of Florence, this marvelous building had already been used for the preservation of grains and for the custody of the General Archives public faith. Nor should I overlook another nobler reason for its construction, derived from Florentine piety: the miraculous Tabernacle of the Madonna di Or. S. Michele. The Lords wanted the temples marvels of architecture and sculpture to complement each other, as we will see in this lesson. Since the original has been lost, I quote from an imperfect copy of the Captains Statutes that appears in Chapter X of the Green Book of Or. S. Michele, in which we read of the ordination made by the republic for the above-mentioned purpose: Templum in statura &amp;amp; forma Palatii cum volta supra coopriente Oratorium, &amp;amp; alia deinceps , &amp;amp; tesso , atquesor platea, ubi consueverat esse sorum denominatum Orto di S. Michele, cui erant confines a 1 &amp;amp; 2 via, a 3 Illorum de domo de Abbatibus, &amp;amp; 4 de domo Caligariis, &amp;amp; cuius constructio fuit commissa per Consilium Civitatis Arti Porta S. Maria, &amp;amp; suit ordinatum, quod fierent 12. Pilastra laterum, &amp;amp; in unoquoque ponendum fore statuam S. Advocati cuiusque Artis, &amp;amp; in medio lateris dignioris Figura Advocati Partis Guelforum, cioe S. Ludovici, ut sic B. Virgo Maria defenderet &amp;amp; augeret Artes &amp;amp; Universitates buius Civitatis, ut apparet mentio de pradictis facts per Reformationem editam manu Ser Folchi Ser Antonii Notarii Populi &amp;amp; Com. Flor an. 1309 De mense Aprilis. Meaning: The temple in stature and form of a palace with a vault above the oratory, and another successively, and tesso, and the street, where it had customarily been called Orto di S. Michele, whose first and second borders were on the road, the third side across from the house of their abbots, and the fourth from the house of the Caligaries. Its construction was entrusted by the Council of the Silk Guild, and it was arranged that twelve piers should hold the saintly advocates of the guilds, along with the patron saint of the Guelph party  S. Louis  so that B. Virgo Maria could defend and enhance the guilds and institutions of the State, as appears in the contract written by Ser Folchi Ser Antonio, Notary Public &amp;amp; Com. Flor, in the year 1309, the month of April. Therefore, we have from such an authoritative Book with the public Decree of the new construction delegated to the Silk guild, called the Por. S. Maria, for the fortunate and grandiose initiation of the foundation, or rather of the designs for, this building, in the year 1309. Taddeo Gaddi, the publics architect of the time, had to do the design, but the pillars were not installed until 1337. The delay was caused by the Emperor Henry VIIs siege of Florence. He was the enemy of the Florentines his whole life since the war with the Pisans and Lucchesi and internal discord, but calm returned to the city on July 29 of the aforementioned year. The first stone was placed by Gonfaloniere Strozza, attended by the Signoria, and all the magistrates. Then followed all the people with the blessing of the Florentine Bishop Francesco Silvestri from Cingoli. Giovanni Villani spoke of this solemn function in book XI of his Chronicles, in chapter 66. To not repeat the things I said above, I will rather report some circumstance noted by Leopold del Migliore, on page 540, as follows: The ceremony which was performed in the name of the Guelphs who dominated the city, never reduced to such a happy state as it is now. It was marked by the throwing of gold and silver coins, minted on one side with the building and these letters: Ut magnificentia Pouli Flor Artis, &amp;amp; Artificum ostendatur. On the other were the arms of the republic and we can read Reip. &amp;amp; Popili Honor &amp;amp; Decus Those who were by chance there and told about it added more details, such as the fact that the Ambassador of the city of Arezzo threw a small coin onto the pile. How many years later the place reached its current state of sublime perfection is not possible to determine; although there are some paintings by Jacopo del Casentino, Lorenzo di Credi, and Andrea del Sarto, and Giovanni Antonio Sogliani. Luca della Robbia produced three of the tondi, and between them appear many statues that were produced in the fifteenth century by Donatello and his workshop that were done with innovation, noble design, and beauty. You many also wonder who the architect was, since in a folder in the church Leopold del Migliore praises Andrea Orcagna and Baldinucci gives credit to Taddeo Gaddi as the architect. However, I believe that they are correct in part, and we will see this once we distinguish the length of time it took to complete the project. First, in 1284, Arnolfo built the Loggia by order of the Signoria. Second, in 1337 Taddeo Gaddi installed the pillars which were first made of bricks, and then covered up with stone and marble. Gaddi then died in 1350. In 1352, according to Baldinucci, Orcagna worked on the altar of the Madonna until 1359, at which time he became the architect. As for the expense, Varchi writes that it reached eighty-six thousand gold florins, an enormous amount considering the currencys value in those times. Twenty thousand florins were diverted from the grain Loggia for the use of the church, as mentioned above. I found in the books of Commissions in the years 1339 and 1350, assigned to Silk Art, that this money was obtained without aggravating the municipality with a new tax, but that certain levies were created called the seven Piazzas from the Mallevadoria dellArmi. Villani call it a small duty, as if by this diminutive term he meant how the little amount assigned to be collected was multiplied for the good of commerce that such an excellent amount could have been raised. However, I would like to recall an incredible entry which can be found in the book called Campione on page 14, and also noted by Villani in book XI, chapter 91. This entry notes that 750 florins of gold were obtained every year merely by sweeping up coins that were left there like trash. Still, we should note here the stupendous contributions made by devotees to the miraculous image, a portion of which was given to the magnificent ornamentation of this solemn and very rich temple. This praise will truly prove to be appropriate for Or. S. Michele, and much greater still for what we will say to describe its qualities. Its shape is almost quadrangular, being 42 braccie long, 32 wide, and 80 tall. It is all encrusted with strong squared stone which is water resistant and season-proof.According to Vasari, all gothic style buildings made in Tuscany at the time were walled up, and this Barbarian Architectural can be seen in this tower. However, in it we see one of the first improvements of the art, which was done to reinvigorate it. We can observe the arches which are turned into a portion of a circle and above the main pillars of the vault there are two series of large adorned windows in the compartments formed by marble columns. In the triangles of the front we can see the coat of arms of the Republic, the Guelph Party, and the royal house of Naples which is a shield divided in half with lilies on one side, and flat listre on the other. This was done for the Kingdom of Hungary, which was under the rule of Louis Anjou, son of Charles, when the loggia was built. He was such a friend and protector of the Florentines and Guelphs that as a sign of gratitude they raised there his coat of arms. At the time, this was the greatest benevolence that Florence ever professed towards a monarch. The place was finished with a wreath of openwork roses, which was supported by corbels that swing outward and gracefully turn around you like a parapet. The ground runs around a stone foundation a little higher than four braccie up to the niches, in which appear statues of the patron saints of the guilds. Some of these larger than lifesize figures were made of metal and others of marble, but all were beautifully carved. They spared no expense to outdo the work of previous masters. A comment in a book marked F reads as follows: Knowing how important it is to give heart to those who work hard to bring about ideas, try to leave his most honored name and fame to his homeland through rare workmanship. It is desired that those who have already been elected to show off their talent, and to know about the Statues of Or. S. Michele, be amply rewarded. To give an account of these statues starting from the eastern side to the via dei Calzaioli, in the first niche there was St. Luke, then St. Thomas, followed by St. John the Baptist. Towards the middle, the first niche holds St. John the Evangelist, St. George is in the second, St. James is in the third, and St. Mark the fourth. On the side of the magistrate, St. Lo was on the first pillar, then St. Stephen and third St. Matthew. Turning to Tramontana, the first niche is vacant for a certain reason of which we speak later; the second spot contains the Quattro Coronati, followed by St. Philip and then St. Peter. Coming back to St. Luke, this statue was made by Giambologna for the guild of the Judges and Notaries, also known as the Proconsolo, whose coat of arms is a star of gold, which fills the whole field with silver carved in the corners of the base. St. Thomas was made by Andrea del Verrocchio, disciple of Donatello. The saint seems so alive that it appears to be led by love to touch the wound of Christ. It was done at the expense of Mercanzia, which has a red star on a white bale as an insignia. By virtue of a public decree, St. Louis should be placed in this niche but we do not know why he was withdrawn from the niche save for matters of style. I read in the Green Champion, ordered in 1483, that Andrea was satisfied with this workmanship and placed its value at up to 800 large florins. St. John the Baptist belongs to the Merchants Guild, formerly the Consuls of the Calimala, whose symbol is a golden eagle on a white bale in a red field. The workmanship is by Ghiberti, whose name is written to the hem of the suit. However, we must confess that this is a languid figure in comparison to his other marvelous works. St. John the Evangelist, made of bronze, is the work of Baccio da Montelupo who made it with great diligence for the Silk guild, for whom the symbol is a red door on a silver field. Next is St. George, whose first location was in Tramontana, very proportionate to his greatness. We will later talk about the reason for his moving. The armorers and swordsmen, who make metal jackets and rapiers for weapons, had it done. This figure is esteemed by all as the most beautiful. In addition to what Vasari says about it, Bocchi has made a treatise titled The Excellence of the Statue of St. Giorgio made by Donatello, which was printed in 1584 by Marescotti. Nearby is the statue of St. James of the guild of the Furriers, who have on their coat of arms a white sheep on a field of blue. This saint was done by Nanni di Antonio del Bianco and is very much liked. St. Mark is by Donatello, of which Michelangelo said: That if such was the semblant of the living Saint, he could be believed in everything he has written, as much shows the statue of an honest man. Nanni made St. Louis for the Farriers guild, as evidenced by their coat of arms, which is a pair of black pincers. Admirable is the St. Stephen, a worthy work of Ghiberti, as a reward of which he also had the grace to make St. Matthew which is for the Wool Guild, having a white sheep with a white banderola and a red cross on a blue field as the coat of arms; there is also that of the Bankers guild, whose symbol was a red field sown with gold coins. In the archive of said guild there is a book in which, in addition to reading the allocation of the statue to Ghiberti, you can find how the officers of the guild obtained the niche, which had previously been given to the guild of the bakers to place their protector, St. Lawrence. However, being that the statue was poor valueless art, on the 24th of June in 1419 the Signoria, led by Gonfaloniere Niccol di Franco Sacchetti  with the consent of the bakers  gave their place to the bankers to make the figure of St. Matthew, for which Lorenzo Ghiberti received 650 gold florins. Two marble statuettes, worked with honor by Niccol Aretino, can also be observed in this place. After this comes the empty niche, where nothing remains except a base with a prodigious half-relief by Donatello representing St. George who kills the Dragon, praised by Raffaello Borghini with these words one can look at it, but not imitate it. The Quattro Coronati are by Nanni, representing four different Masters of the arts with the ax, the shoe, the ladle, and other blacksmith tools. The artist was troubled with their positioning in such a narrow place. However, his master Donatello, with the reward of only a dinner, with a few industrious blows, arranged them in a way to cover the disciples error, which got him esteem and wonder from all. Next is St. Philip, made by Nanni for the guild of the shoemakers. St. Peter was for the Guild of the Butchers, intelligently made by Donatello. Vasari holds it to be an admirable and extremely rare work due to the graceful drapery corresponding to the altitude of the body, so that the clothes are not better worn on a living man. Such a litany of statues, united this way and exhibited to the public, is seen in very few cities. Many have come from distant places to see them, confessing that it seems to them a rare thing indeed. To defend these statues and uphold the respect demanded by the Florentines, we have the statute which imposes punishment on anyone who throws stones at them or does some harm to them. We can find another beautiful view in the archways between pillars, adorned with four tall columns, on each of which is a statue one and a half braccie tall. In all they are forty, decorated with rustic acanthus leaves, as the arabesques that fill the arches are very vague. The last things to be seen above the niches are paintings in the twelve terracotta tondi, all but three of which are ruined, by Luca della Robbia. They depict a Madonna with a child on her neck above the pillar of St. George, the army of the Republic above St. Thomas, and the symbol of the guild of Por Santa Maria above St. John. Now it remains to discuss the aforementioned translation of the Madonna from the guild of the Doctors and Apothecaries that one can now see at S. Giorgio. However, having to assemble in another lesson on the many shining virtues from the interior of the Temple, in which we will talk again about the story of this decorative program, we will here return to praise this wonderful construction, some verses from the famous Dominican poet: Nunc ubi magna domus pracelsa turris ad instar Fertur in aereas altius una plagas  Qua licet ex omni videatur splendida parte Sanctorum Statuas dum soris ipsa tenet. Attamen apparet longe speciosor intus Fulget ubi Sancta Matris Imago Dei. Meaning: Now where the great house towers, said to be in bronze, one of the higher quarters From which one may be seen on every side the splendid statues of the saints while she holds the statues of sori. However, it appears far more beautiful inside where the image of the Holy Mother of God shines. Third Lesson: It is impossible to discuss the church interior in an orderly manner without considering the prodigious altar of the Madonna of Or. S. Michele, already described in the first lesson. I must add to the aforementioned discussion a comment on the laudable uses made from the great riches it has generated for the republic, and the daily sacred rites the altar services. To start with the first one, I will note a document indicating the great treasures spent in pious works by the superiors of the Oratory. Thanks to the captains, in addition to the splendid and noble maintenance of the church, they were able to administer large sums of money for the workings of the Monasteries of Chiarito, Lapo, and San Giorgio. Today they are considered exemplary monasteries in Florence, and their establishment is noted in the writings of Ser Michele di Ghirolfo da Lucardo in 1342 and Ser Salvestro Salvestri in 1405 in the general archive. About the second point, I would like to refer to the institution formed by the republic in 1415, composed of a collegiate of ten Priests and two cherici with a head called Proposto (Superintendent). Its establishment can be found a book with wooden covers in the archives of the captains. It can be read there that up until that time, the Oratory had been used by a single priest with the title of Sacristan. With the intervention of the musicians, they assist with the performance of the usual lauds to Mary on the holidays, and on every Saturday at the unveiling of the sacred Image with the singing of the litany, at which time 26 candles burn, with 12 at the altar, 6 at the tendrils, and eight at the garland. By legacy of Luca di Filippo Carnesecchi Gentiluomo Fiorentino, two candles must always be lit for the Mass at the Consecration. In his Testament of 1601, drawn up by Ser Antonio di Ser Chello, he says I leave two doublets of yellow wax of 15 pounds to be perpetually lit to the Madonna of Or S. Michele at the time of the elevation of the host. Passing now to recall how many sacred and beautiful things were in this Oratory, I will say that leaning against the pillar, next to this chapel, there is a larger than life-size wood crucifix, carved in a primitive style that the Florentines venerate. Based on the authority of the writers of Holy Archbishop Antoninuss life, it was believed that it was customary for him to go there to pray when he was a child; so he was painted at the foot of the cross, at that age. However, we cant confirm without an authoritative document whether the Crucifix of dried Elm actually spoke to the Saint (Antoninus). However, I believe Rondinellis report of the plague, in which he wrote: The Friars of St. Mark went in procession on many Fridays to the Crucifix of Or. S. Michele to which St. Antonino went to pray as a boy. I must thank those Benefactors, who in the year 1714 made for this divine image a richly carved tabernacle with a gilded canopy, pavonazzi pendants, and gold fringes. Opposite in the second pillar, you can see a fresco figure of The Good Thief, which was rarely painted in those days: the painter not only nailed him to the cross, but tied his legs with ropes so that he would not be confused with Christ Jesus. This is the customary way the Church made it, as Molano noted. I will now talk about the reason this painting was placed here. For 300 years the painting was noted in the Books of the Compagnia della Croce al Tempio, and copied by Vincenzio del Corno Gentiluomo Fiorentino  lover of old things - in his memoirs, and read about in Leopoldo del Migliores book as follows 1361 N. N. condemned to the gallows, he was from a family more than moderately civil. A few hours before he was taken to the fields, he spoke to a brother of the company of the Neri who was used to assisting those about to suffer publicly. He told him he had a sum of money in a chest at his house at the foot of the Ponte Vecchio. His intention was to have a figure of the Good Thief painted in Or. S. Michele at the pillar near the oratory so that one could pray to God that in that last short breath, so that he would use the mercy to bless him. Whoever fulfilled this legacy wrote this memoir. This image was painted by Iacopo Landini from Prato Vecchio, known as the Casentino (Jacopo del Casentino). We will now mention about the other paintings in that space, almost all of which were his. The vault indeed is by Jacopo, where he represented sixteen Patriarchs and Prophets who pose on a field of ultramarine blue, a color that cost a lot since it has to be extracted from the precious lapis lazuli stones. There were many state citizens who murmured about it saying it was a waste of the Madonna of Orsanmicheles money. However, this bold talk displeased the people so much that, according to Cambi, they wanted the imprisonment of one member of the Foraboschi house to satisfy the outrage of Mary. Returning to Jacopo del Casentino, likewise he painted the many saints that appear above the other in the arches. On a second ovate St. Mary Magdalene is carried to heaven by the angels, the latter painted by the hand of Andrea del Sarto. St. Stephen, painted between the two doors, was made by Poppi, who again made the two paintings, that are in the choir, of Christ and St. John the Baptist. The St. Martin in front of St. Stephen is believed to be of the Sogliani. The St. Augustine in the middle of the choir is also believed to be his although there are those who say it was done by Albertinelli. On the wall under the organ, Agnolo Gaddi represented Christ Disputing among the Doctors. And lets not neglect to report what Doctor Brocchi recalls having happened to the figure of St. Verdiana, who is seen at the pillar of the corner of this church next to the image of St. Lucy. This image particularly flourished in our times, but to the great detriment of history the painter erased the inscription written in gothic characters underneath. Stranger still, the Saint can now be seen in secular clothing, whereas normally she was shown wearing a religious habit. The important chapel of St. Anne was erected by of the Municipality of Tramontana, which was dedicated to commemorate the most important action that could happen in a free republic, the expulsion of the Tyrant Duke of Athens and violent occupier of the Florentine Domain. This occurred on July 26, 1343 the feast of St. Annes, who became honored for her assistance as one of the patron saints of the city, receiving the title Propitia &amp;amp; F. utrix libertatis Civitatis Florentina, the woman of liberty of the state of Florence. In the Book of Riformagioni Lib. B. of 1349, appears a record of how the Signoria decreed to spend three thousand florins of gold for the erection of a new chapel in Or. S. Michele. This chapel was then demolished in 1526 by the captains so that the altar could receive on top of it the larger-than-life white marble figure of the Virgin Mary Carrying the Infant Jesus in her womb, a highly praised work by Francesco da San Gallo. On the 26th of July, the Signoria annually took part in a ritual offering with the Captains of the guilds. There was on that day a horse race, among other things of great joy, ordered in the Statutes of the 28 of October 1343 with this beautiful introduction of words: Pro honore Reip. &amp;amp; ad perpetuam memomoriam libertatis Civitatis Florentia, &amp;amp; ut Civium mentibus sit infixum, qualiter die S. Anna de mense Iulii Populus Flor per Dei gratiam, &amp;amp; virtutem bonorum, a Tyrannide Ducis Atbernarum liberatus. Meaning: In honor of the Commonwealth and to the perpetual remembrance of the liberty of the state of Florence, and so that it may be fixed in the minds of the citizens, how on the day of St. Anna, in the month of July, the people of Flor, by the grace of God and the virtue of good men, were freed from the tyranny of the duke of Athens. And in a panel of the church we read that on this feast day is exhibited the relic of the saint, which is kissed by the Friars of the Centuria and the Nuns of SS. Trinit. I will now speak about another chapel and refer back to what I promised in the preceding lesson. A Madonna seated with her son made by Simone da Fiesole, pupil of Brunelleschi, was placed at the niche of the Apothecaries. It was then transferred to the church where it was placed at one of the two large doors to form a chapel. The reason for this was that in 1628, many people swore to have seen this statue blink and move, which then caused a panic. They all ran away in very large numbers, forming crowds during the day and night to the point that the streets had to be blocked to escape the tumult. Everyone was shouting for mercy, which was one of the preludes to the plague which came to Florence in 1630. To divert the devout people, who refused leave there, Grand Duke Ferdinand resolved to transfer it inside. This miraculous event was processed by the order of Archbishop Alessandro Marzimedici and the Canon Cavaliere Giovanni Guidacci, one of the people who claimed to have seen the statue blink several times. During the time of the Republic, another similar case occurred (in 1493) with the image of the Madonna, which was standing outside of its niche. In this case an uncoverted Jew, on a fine day when he thought he couldnt be seen, struck the statue with an iron rood, a crime for which he was killed. This incident can be read today at the foot of the marble, and the sacrilege also appears in the Chronicle by Forese da Ribatta, who goes into more detail saying that his body was thrown into St. Stephens sewer as a final contempt. The words carved into the marble base in the memory of this fact are the following: Hanc ferro effigiem petiit ludeus, &amp;amp; Index Ipse fibi vulgo dilaniatus obit MccccLxxXXlII. Knowing that the title of Or. S. Michele is frequently mentioned in these lessons, I will now report the origin of its name as it contains significant information about antiquity which I do know if historians truly speak about. I begin by examining the doubt that there was already an Oratory there since 750, dedicated to the Holy Arcangel. To be safe with the authoritative documents, I will first say that shortly after the year 1000 there was a Parish Church with a contiguous garden that was called San Michele in Orto(garden). It was situated in the most dignified place in the city and was truly more venerable than any other which was in Florence. The fact that it was a Parish is very clear from the very ancient sources, which declare it as such in a testament in the Badia Archive number 25 among the following witnesses: Filippus Pieri Ranerii, S. Micaelis in orto 1100. In many ancient contracts of the Mozzi family, who lived along the route that passes by S. Gregorio to the Arno River, the parish of San Michele in Orto is mentioned. It later passed to the Cistercian monks of the abbey of S. Silvestro di Nonatola, but I have not been able to find a source for this. The truth is that Pope Innocentius III, in one of his notes from Viterbo in 1209, confirms to said Monks that this church was still of S. Michele: Ecclesias S. Felicis, S. Martini in Mamma, &amp;amp; S. Michaelis intus Flor. Afterwards, when the Republic had to reassume its patronage and claimed its ancient rights, it had to displace the Cistercians, which was met with some disgust from Rome which can be found in the Reformations in a letter from Papa Inocenzio IV dating back to 1249. In it, the republic was urged to return the church to the abbey of Nonantola, together with the castle of S. Martino. The effects of this exhortation can be seen in the resolutions of the republic. Since the Signoria needed a piazza for the sale of grain and large rooms to store it, they had the church leveled, as it was considered a very opportune location. A Loggia was then to be built, of which the Migliore says the following on page 530: With the design of Arnolfo Panno 1284 which was founded on the ancient church of S. Michele. To not lose the memory of such an ancient church, the Republic wanted Arnolfo to build another one in front of the new Loggia at the same time. This is the present oratory, called S. Michele Vecchio but today called S. Carlo. The reason for this is that S. Carlo da Paolo (Borromeo) had recently been canonized and the fame of his holiness penetrated everywhere. The main cities, especially Florence, were filled with devotion to the saint. After remembering about the ancient passage from Florence to Milan, made by the Borromeans, and of the space made for the saint, he ordered some relics to be brought from Milan to Florence. The first of these relics was a large piece of the shirt he was wearing when he died and a sponge which had been used to collect his blood. The solemnity in receiving them was very great due to the devotion among the people. However, Cosimo II foresaw that the place where these relics were to be placed was very narrow to celebrate the sacred translation. Wanting to give a sign of his usual devotion and grateful to show himself courteous to the offers from the Cardinal, he signed a memorial to the Company of the Lombards, to whom they were to direct the relics. This granted the brothers the oratory of San Michele as a more capable place than the church of S. Miniato, where the company gathered having already moved from S. Pier del Murrone, today called S. Giovannino in Via di S. Gallo. Furthermore, his highness wanted the captains of Or. S. Michele who had the dominion of the oratory to donate it by decree of 1616, on the condition that no coat of arms would ever be placed on it (arme). Then, the very ancient painting depicting a dead Christ was removed from the high altar and was transferred to the door inside. It was replaced afterwards by Matteo Rosellis painting, in which S. Carlo was dressed as a cardinal  a glorious, shiny, and resplendent figure surrounded by angels. Among them, in the first place was S. Michele with his insignia. However, the captains foresaw that the new veneration to S. Carlo would make us forget the Oratory of S. Michele, which was illustrated by Pope Alexander VII in the ninth year of his pontificate of a perpetual indulgence for the Brothers on the Feast of St. Charles. The grandstand of the altar had been erected in ancient times by the Pilli Consular Family, of which Dante speaks in Canto XVI of Paradiso: Great was the column of the Vajo. In the scriptures of Or. S. Michele we read High altar of the Oratory of S. Michele made in the execution of the testament of Messer Bindo dei Pilli in the year 1376. On the left, as you enter, you can see a panel by Fabbrizio Boschi who portrayed the presentation of Christ in the temple with a beautiful design and a vivacity of colors. As a sign of the patronage of the captains, their unifom is carved in gilded bronze characters which are the three letters: O.S.M. Finally I return to the loggia of Or. S. Michele, which was said to have been a tower for grain storage supported by 16 pillars. It was subsequently judged by the Grand Duke Cosimo I to be a suitable place to store and preserve documents and historical writings from fire and water. A medal was made with the effigy of the Grand Duke and his name on one side, and on the reverse was the open door of the archives, with many illustrated books for protocols with crowns on the title page and letters around it which said: Publica Fidei. There is still an inscription on the door of the archives located in the via Calimala in gold lettering and it says: ARCHIVIVM HOC PERPETVITATI PVBLICORVM MONIMENTORVM CONSERVANDAE DICATVM SERENISS COSMVS MED. EREXIT . QVAMPRIMVM MAGNVS DVX HETRVRIAE SALVTATVS REGIAQVE corona insignitvs est mdlxix. I thought I had finished my historical memoirs about Or. S. Michele, however, I should speak of an indispensable piece of information without which the reader would misunderstand the officials of Or. San. Michele. Two magistrates had similar appelations. The first was responsible for the care of the Piazza or Loggia, regarding the sale of wheat and fodder. The second magistrate was in charge of the good governance of the company and Oratory of the Madonna of Or. S. Michele, along with extensive jurisdiction over the goods donated to the Holy Image. This difference between these two positions appears in the Carnera Fiscale in the book marked 1344, which contains various decrees and writings of the Priori at the Podest of Florence. Under the date February 27, the following excerpts about grain officials can be found: Filippus Rochi de Capponibus, Zenobius Lapi Risaliti, Dominicus Rizzini Fagioli, &amp;amp; Mattheus Roselli Pictor Officiales extracti pro Comuni Flor. ad Officium Platea O. Si M. pro termino, &amp;amp; tempore quatuor mensium. With this document, I regret to have to note the mistake of Leopoldo del Migliore on page 369 of his Illustrated Florence. Leopoldo stated that the aformentioned Matteo da Rosello was one of the captains of the Madonna of Or. S. Michele even though his name was never mentioned by other scholars. However, if he is not among the captains of the Madonna, he deserved to be placed by Giorgio Vasari among the painters as determined in the above-mentioned election. Among his works is the painting of Hell, which he completed in Or. S. Michele. Going back to Leopoldos Illustrated Florence, on the same page we can find the following words: Painted naturally in that hell were many sad men of that age, among which were the Duke of Athens with his followers, since they were traitors of the lordship of Florence. They had shown themselves contrary to the public interest as they went against freedom and were thieves with evil tongues. The resemblances in the painting were so excellent that those who had known them were able to point them out in the painting. For as long as the painting stood, the following proverb was said in Florence: He is portrayed in S. Michele and that is enough. This work was done by Matteo di Rossello, an ancient and civil painter. Returning to the Captains, I must add that these positions were abolished by our Emperor who gave the supervision of the sacred temple to a single gentleman, who is currently Mr. Domenico Baldigiani. I will recall here the twentieth congregation of priests, known as the visitation which recognized its beginning on February 24, 1494. This congregation was composed of exactly 40 priests and they gathered in the church of S. Michele in Palchetto, where the following title can be read on the door: CONGREGATIO VISITATIONIS PRESBYTERORVM. Meaning, Association for the Visitation of Priests. ### Italiano Originale: Notizie Istoriche della Chiese Fiorentine della Madonna di Orsanmichele Lezione Prima: Molte, e molte sono in Firenze le miracolose Immagini di Maria, tra le quali la pi gloriosa and mai sempre quella di Or S. Michele o si voglia per la moltiplicit dei secoli, o per la quantit dei miracoli, o per la qualit degli onori; i quali tre privilegi mi piace di far vedere in questa Lezione. Ma prima dir si vuole del suo sovrano Tabernacolo nella vaghezza del disegno, e nella ricchezza dei marmi sorpassante ogni umana estimazione: movendomi a ci fare la mancanza di molte pregevoli notizie tralasciate da Francesco Bocchi, da Giovanni Cinelli, e da Filippo Baldinucci, i quali scrissero di questOratorio; e pi assai ne poteva scrivere Giorgio Vasari nella vita di Andrea Orcagna ; tutta volta ToM I. Fart L A Tuttavolta principier dal riportare quello, che sommariamente egli scrisse come appresso Poco poi avendo gli Uomini della Compagnia di Or S. Michele messi insieme molti denari di limosine, e beni stati donati a quella Madonna per la mortalit del 1348. Risolverono volerle fare intorno una Cappella, ovvero Tabernacolo non solo di marmi in tutti i modi intagliati , e di altre pietre di pregio ornatissimo, e ricco, ma di mosaico ancora , e di ornamenti di bronzo, quanto pi desiderare si potesse , in tanto che per opera, e per materia avanzasse ogni altro lavoro infino a quel d per tanta grandezza stato fabbricato ; perci dato carico di tutto allOrcagna, come al pi eccellente di quellet, egli fece tanti disegni, che finalmente uno ne piacque a chi governava, come migliore di tutti gli altri; onde allogato il lavoro a lui, si rimisero in tutto al giudizio , e consiglio suo, perch egli dato a diversi maestri dintaglio avuti di pi paesi, a fare tutte le altre cose, attese con il suo fratello a condurre tutte le Figure dellopera , e finito il tutto le fece murare, e commettere insieme molto consideratamente senza calcina con ispranghe di rame impiombate, acciocch i marmi lustrati, e puliti non si macchiassero, la qual cosa gli riusc tanto bene con utile, ed onore di quelli, che sono stati dopo di lui , che a chi considera quellopera, pare mediante tale unione, e commettiture trovate dallOrcagna, che tutta la Cappella sia cavata di un pezzo di marmo solo . E ancorch ella sia di maniera Tedesca, in quel genere ha tanta grazia, e proporzione, ch ella tiene il primo luogo fra le cose di quei tempi, essendo massimamente ii suo componimento di Figure grandi e piccole, e di Angeli, e di Profeti di mezzo rilievo intorno alla Madonna benissimo condotti. E maraviglioso ancora il getto dei recingimenti di bronzo diligentemente puliti, che girando intorno a tutta lopera la racchiuggono, e serrano insieme di maniera che essa ne rimane non meno gagliarda, e forte, che in tutte le altre parti bellissima. Ma quanto egli si affaticasse per mostrare in quella et grossa la sottigliezza del suo ingegno, si vede in una Storia grande di mezzo rilievo nella parte di dietro di detto Tabernacolo, dove in fgure di un braccio, e mezzo luna fece i dodici Apostoli, che in alto guardano la Madonna, mentre in una mandorla circondata di Angioli saglie al Cielo, in uno dei quali Apostoli ritrasse se stesso vecchio, comera, con la barba rasa col cappuccio avvolto al capo, e col viso piatto, tondo. Oltre a ci scrisse a basso nel marmo queste parole: Andreas Cionis Pictor Florentinus Oratorii Archimagister exstitit bujus 1359. Sin qui il Vasari nulla dicendo della variet dei preziosi marmi, e rarissime pietre, nulla delle tante belle fgure, e statue, e nulla de misteri effigiati nei bassi rilievi; anzi egli accennando quello della SS. Vergine Assunta prende uno sbaglio, ove dice, che gli Apostoli guardano la Madonna salita in Cielo, conciossiacosach non uno, ma due sono i bassi rilievi qui divisi in due quadri, nel primo dei quali in alto evvi la Vergine Assunta circondata dagli Angioli con appi della Tavoia alcuni alberi lavorati con rara finezza, e nel secondo spartimento da basso , che nulla ha che fare collaltro divisato, vedesi la Madonna morta attorniata dagli Apostoli, traquali, egli  vero , che lOrcagna ritrasse se stesso, ma non gi vecchio , come il suddetto Scrittore disse, avvegnach il bravo Artefice morisse nel 1389. di anni 60. e per nel 1359. nel quale fin il Tabernacolo, doveva avere anni 30. senza pi. E principiando qu a supplire nelle cose, che s desiderano negli Scrittori di questa Cappella , notar mi piace in primo luogo, come un bellissimo disegno di questOpera con sue misure fatto di propria mano dellOrcagna vedes al presente, dopo un corso di anni 400. benissimo conservato nell insigne Libreria degli antichi manoscritti, e spogli del gi Senatore Carlo Strozzi , e noi merc la cortesia del Signor Carlo Tommaso suo degno Nipote ne diamo in rame la figura. Or venendo alla esatta descrizione, nellangolo della Loggia verso il mezzo di (Continua alla seguente pagina) Mezzo di il mio Leggitore incontrer una platea ornata di vari marmi, alta quanto uno scalino, e larga tre braccia, la quale ricorre intorno al Tabernacolo coperto da una tribuna a cupola, e circondato di ricca balaustrata, posando su duna scalinata pure di marmo. Nei quattro angoli del cancello lavorato con arabeschi di bronzo veggonsi quattro piedistalli, che sostengono una colonna spirale, sul di cui capitello evvi una statua rappresentante un Angioo: queste colonne sono alte braccia quattro, e tre quarti, e gli Angioli braccia uno, e un quarto. Dentro poi a questa nobile balaustrata si innalza il tanto commendato Tabernacolo retto da quattro pilastri, ciascuno dei quali ha nove colonne alte braccia tre, e un sesto, e grosse un quarto, tra luna, e laltra di esse veggendosi pietre dure rilucenti con abbondevolezza di lapislazzuli non solamente nei pilastri, ma nelle basi, e negli archi della Cupola. Dodici sono i Profeti, quali alti un braccio, e mezzo girano sullarchitrave, avendo ciascuno un cartello in mano esprimente le virt di Maria Vergine, e sonovi quattro guglie lavorate alla Gottica alte braccia sei, e un ottavo senza la base, le quali mettono in mezzo la Cupola alta braccia sei, e un quarto, e nel pi alto di esta un Angiolo alto braccia due. N dallocchio fuggire ci debbono i vaghi arabeschi, e fogliami finissimi di marmo sparsi da per tutto in s fatta guisa, che miracolosi piuttosto che rari sono riputati ; e per fine nellimbasamento della Tribuna in bassi rilievi graziosissimi otto misteri si rappresentano, e sono la Nativit di Maria, la sua Presentazione al Tempio, lo Sposalizio con San Giuseppe, la Nunziata , la Nascita di Cristo, lEpifania , la Circoncisione , e nellottavo, giusta lantica tradizione, lArtefice effigi un Angelo, che porta alla Vergine una palma quale annunzio di sua vicina morte. Nel mezzo adunque di cos ragguardevole Tribuna sopra un ricco altare circondata da bellissimi Angioli di rilievo adorasi la Tavola tanto famosa nei Mondo tutto dellImmagine di Maria Vergine, detta la Madonna. Madonna di Or S. Michele potentissima Avvocata dei Fiorentini. Ma perch moderno Autore Toscano per altro letterato, qual si fu Giulio Mancini ,in un suo discorso di pittura, che lasci scritto a penna, nega , che questa Immagine fosse dipinta da Ugolino Sanese , io riporter qu la dotta difesa dal Baldinucci scritta nella vita dellOrcagana, come segue : Soggiungeremo per ultimo, che lo Scrittor moderno, di cui parlammo pur dianzi, ha creduto equivoco del Vasari, laver affermato, che la sacra Immagine di Maria Vergine ornata da questo Tabernacolo fosse fatta per mano di Ugolino morto nel 1349. ed essendo limmagine stata dipinta nel 1284. Non gli pareva verisimile, che in quel tempo, cio del 1284. Ugolino avesse potuto essere ben istruito in pittura, che potesse avere una talopera dipinta, e che la maniera si avvicinava pi alla Greca, che a quella, che allora usavasi in Firenze; e finalmente che lImmagine  sopra a legno, e Vasari dice, che fosse fatta da Ugolino nel pilastro. Ma se bene si considera, non avr pi luogo il dubbio del soprannominato Autore, prima perch il Vasari nella sua prima edizione dice, che Ugolino mor non gi nel 1349 ma nel 1339 e tanto nella prima, che nella seconda edizione afferma, che Ugoiino morisse in et decrepita; sicch fatto bene il conto, egli nel 1284. pot essere in et di 30 o di 35 anni almeno, e conseguentemente nel pi bello del suo operare. Secondariamente dice il Vasari nella prima edizione, e nella seconda ancora a lettere apertissime, che Ugolino oper di maniera Greca, anzi, che tale antica maniera volle egli sempre ostinatamente tenere, non ostante che da molti Pittori del suo tempo, e dallo stesso Giotto s operasse di assai miglior maniera : sicch per questo stesso dobbiamo dire, che la pittura  mano di Ugolino . Che poi ella sa sopra legno, o sopra muro, forse pu essere, che lo Stampatore delle opere di Vasari in luogo di dire: fece lImmagine di nostra Donna per un pilastro della Loggia ec. dicesse: in un pilastro e quando anche cosi aves. E quando anche cosi avesse detto il Vasari troviamo ancora, che il medesimo, e con Iui molti di coloro, che hanno scritte vite dei Pittori, hanno usato dire, fece una tavola nella tal Chiesa, e non per questo sintende che quella tavola fosse fatta in quella Chiesa , ma per quella Chiesa, non nella tal Cappella , ma per quela Cappella, cio che dovea andare in quella Chiesa, o Cappella. Cos laver detto il Vasari, Ugolino fece la Nostra Donna nel pilastro, non ci toglie il poter credere, che egli volesse dire, che Ugolino avesse sopra tavola fatta limmagine per rapportarsi, e stuarsi poi nel pilastro, onde il dubbio par che si riduca ad una mera cavillazione. E cos compiuto avendo allobbligo di rintracciare tutte le pi notevoli cose di questa Cappella, passer io a ragionare dei privilegi singolari della Santissima Immagine. E facendomi dalla moitiplicit degli anni, ne quali ella  a Fiorentini in venerazione osservare debbo, che lanno 1292 bench sia il tempo notato da Giovanni Villani, e dagli Scrittori, nel quale strepitosi erano i miracoli , non  per lepoca giusta, avvegnach io trovo la insigne Compagnia della Madonna di Or. S. Michele principiata nel 1291 il qual anno necessariamente suppone, che prima di qualche tempo fosse gi in grande venerazione nel pilastro la miracolosa Tavola , onde sembra, che si possa stabilire , che dopo al 1284 nel qual anno fu fabbricata la loggia, ivi venisse collocata la santissima Tavola. Onde sarebbero gi anni 460 e pi, contando solamente dal 1291 principio dalla Compagnia. E piacemiqu fare non dispregevole riflessione sopra una maravigliosa combinazione di due Santuari nello stesso tempo principiati, e diventati famosi in tutto il Mondo: imperciocch in questo tempo appunto, quando II Cielo apr in Firenze nella nostra Immagine un fonte, o piuttosto un fiume di grazie, gli Angioli portarono la Casa di Nazaret dalla Palestina nellItalia. E se Pontefici Imperatori, Re, e Principi rendettero magnifico ii Tempio Lauretano, la sola Repubblica Fiorentina, come poscia vedremo, non guardando a spendere immensi tesori, fabbric alla Madonna di Or S. Michele una delle pi splendide, e superbe Chiese, come parlano i libri delle Riformagioni Un fiat Beatissime Virgini Marie S. Michaelis in Orto templum splendidissimum, &amp;amp; supra modum splendidissimum. E se alla S. Casa di Loreto da tutte le parti del Mondo divoti Pellegrini si portano, anche da diverse parti dellEuropa venivano i Popoli con larghissme offerte, e voti a venerare la nostra Immagine, cosi scrivendo la Signoria a Papa Urbano V. nel 1364. Ad quod sere concurrunt homines de variis Mundi partibus. E dopo s bella digressione tornando alia nostra Immagine, non debbo tralasciar di dire alcunch della Compagnia di Or S. Micheie, come il pi autorevole documento dimostrante lantichit delia miracolosa Tavola: n meglio io saprei farlo, che riportando sommariamente i Capitoli antichi della medesima Compagnia scritti di carattere del XIV. secolo, e comunicatimi dallerudito, e cortese Sig. Domenico Maria Manni, il prologo dei quali  come segue In nome del Padre, del Figliolo, e dello Spirito Santo. Amen. Ad honore, &amp;amp; reverentia del Nostro Signore Ges Christo, e de la sua Santissima Madre Madonna Santa Maria sempre Vergine, e del Beato Messer Santo Michele Arcangelo, &amp;amp; del Beato Messer Santo Lorenzo, e di tutta la Corte di Paradiso , e ad honore , e reverentia de la Santa Chiesa di Roma , &amp;amp; del Nostro Signore Messer lo Papa, e dei suoi Frati Segnori Cardinali, e di Messer lo Vescovo di Firenze, e ad stato, e honore, e mantenimento de la Citt di Firenze, e del suo distretto, ad bene e consolatione dei Poveri. Questi sono i Capitoli, e gli ordini di quelli, che sono, e saranno de la detta Compagnia, la quale fu cominciata negli anni de la Incarnatione del Nostro Segnore Iesu Christo, MccLxxxxi. il d di Beato Messer Santo Lorenzo del mese di Agosto. Quaranta sono i capitoli, quali io comprendo in tre soli pi che sufficienti, onde viemaggiormente corroborare lalta venerazione dei popoli a questimmagine. E nel primo rammentare si deve la maniera, che tenevasi per consolare limmenso popolo, che in folla chiedeva di essere ascritto alla Compagnia, la quale teneva stipendiato un Notaio obbligato in tutti i giorni feriali, e solenni di stare a desco a registrare i nomi dei fratelli, e delle sorelle, che vi si ascrivevano, e perch uno non reggeva al concorso dei devoti, si prese lespediente, che gli stranieri, e quelli del Contado si facessero scrivere nel popolo, del quale era la Porta, onde essi entravano in Citt, e con raro esempio trovasi nel capitolo XXXVII che si ascrivevano alla Compagnia anche i morti, sol che uno ne portasse al Notaio il nome del defunto , quale scritto nel libro, si faceva lanima sua partecipe dei suffragi; della qual grazia se ne dava la poliza segnata col suggello della Compagnia avente per impronta la Nunziata, ed intorno scritte queste lettere: Sigillum Societatis Virg. Marie Sancti Mich. in orto de Florentia. Al secondo capitolo ristringo tutto quello, che la Compagnia faceva sotto le logge, dir al sacro Pilastro, giacch in quei primi tempi non trovasi nei capitoli nominato Oratorio. In ogni sera adunque si cantavano le laudi da i fratelli chiamati Laudesi, e con maggior solennit di canto nelle vigilie delle feste del Signore , di Maria, degli Apostoli, e dei Santi Avvocati della Citta, facendosi nella notte precedente a simiglianti Feste una illuminazione generale di tutta la Loggia, In tutte le Domeniche dellanno , ed in altri giorni solenni facevasi fare la predica nella Loggia per sufficienti Predicatori, scelti o dal Clero, o dalle Religioni, delle quali prediche lora era dopo il Vespro. Quattro poi guardie in tutta la giornata assidue tenevansi al Pilastro, e due nella notte per ricevere le offerte di cera, di vesti, e di danaro, e talora erano pi copiose le limosine, che facevansi di notte, E finalmente al terzo capitolo pertinenti sono gli esempi di carit , e di piet, che dai fratelli davansi e per la Citt, e per il Contado: devotissime erano due processioni generali di tutta la Compagnia in Ciascunanno a due di queste Chiese, S. Marco, S. Spirito, S. Croce, S. Maria Novella , il Carmine, e la Nonziata, ripigliando il giro ogni tre anni, collofferta per ciascuno Fratello di una candela di unoncia. Ogni Luned si facevano celebrar sei Messe in varie Chiese per i Fratelli defunti, sicch a tutte dentro lanno toccava almeno una Messa, alla quale assister dovea unUfiziale della Compagnia dando dodici soldi al Prete. Ma la cosa pi plausibile era una limosina generale , oltre le quotidiane, la quale facevasi in tutti i Sesti di Firenze, e nel suo Contado, e per vero dire era il giorno di tutto lanno il pi lieto per i poveri, tra quali comprendevansi tutti i Monasteri , Spedali , Prigioni , e Romiti, trovandosi nei Libri della Compagnia avere importato somigliante carit talvolta 37000. lire, delle quali cose and viepi crescendo la fama della nostra Madonna di Or S. Michele, e della Compagnia a lei dedicata. E se ho sin qu ragionato del Libro dei Capitoli, mi si conceda di riportare il titolo, che leggesi nel principio di altro Libro detto Campion Verde, ed  come segue : Codex bonorum piissima Societatis Gloriosissime Virg. Maria S. Michaelis in Orto, merito in toto Orbe re &amp;amp; fama memoratissima, ob suum devotissimum Oratorium sub famoso Templo , ac su pramodnm Eminentissimo, eius nomine fundatum pariter &amp;amp; sonstrutum. Ma avendo chiamata pi fiate miracolosa questa Immagine, qui dir si vuole i moltiplici miracoli a quel Pilastro gia corona facienti, e con tanta abbondevolezza, che Giovanni Villani arrestando il corso alla sua Storia, come a cosa insolita, e di grande stupore , ne scrisse le seguenti parole Ad 3. di Luglio 1292. si cominci a mostrare grandi, e aperti miracoli nella Citt di Firenze per una figura di S. Maria dipinta in un Pilastro della Loggia di Or S. Michele, dove si vende il grano, sanando infermi, e rizzando attratti, e sgombrando imperversaci visibilmente in gran quantit E lo stesso afferma S. Antonino nella Terza Parte di sua Storia come appresso: Eodem anno (1292.) mense Iulii patrata sunt quadam miracula Florentia ex quadam Figura Virginis Gloriosa, qua erat in pariete picta atrii, seu horti S. Michaelis, ubi tunc forum erat frument, &amp;amp; aliorum bladorum. Nam concepta devotione ab omnibus ad Figuram illam infirmis devote orantibus, plures sanati sunt exvariis languoribus, claudi erecti, contracti sanati, &amp;amp; obsessi a doemonibus liberati. E gli stessi prodigi si rammentano di questo Santo Simolacro da Sozomeno Pistoiose nella sua Istoria generale del mondo, la quale in cartapecora conservasi nella libreria dei Canonici Regolari della Badia di Fiesole, come scrive nella sua Biblioteca Pistoiese il Padre Antonio Zaccaria, che non gran diligenza, e somma erudizione ho dato alle stampe, leggendosi nella suddetta Istoria come segue: Anno 1292. Die 3. Mensis Iulii Figura picta B. Virginis Maria, qua erat in horto S. Michaelis fecit multa miracula sanando infirmos &amp;amp; elaudos, unde fuit maxima devotio totius populi &amp;amp; finitimorum, &amp;amp; tantum aucta est, quod singulis annis distribuebantur sex mille libbra, &amp;amp; usque ad hodiernum diem extat devotio. Ed in s fatta guisa parlano tutti gli Scrittori Toscani, niuno per, che io sappia, avendo notato il pi ammirabile di tutti i prodigi, che fu lessere la stessa miracolosa Tavola rimasa illesa dallincendio in Firenze procurato da Ser Neri Abati nel 1304., avendo per altro le fiamme arse non solamente le case contigue, ma la Loggia stessa. Altri miracoli ancora si possono osservare dipinti nei vetri delle finestre, le quali  stato creduto da taluno, che fossero le prime in citt a vedersi dipinte, dopo che di fiandra fu portato il segreto a Firenze. Intanto la quantit, e qualita di questi miracoli produsse vari effetti, quali io non posso non rammentare, ed il primo derivato da s alta cagione fu, che alcuni religiosi maestri in divinita, non dando facilmente fede ai quotidiani prodigi, che raccontavansi, giudicarono in materia s gelosa di culto, e di fede, di fare alcuni esami sopra la verita dei prodigi, e darne al popolo saggi avvertimenti, cosa che loro suscito una piccola persecuzione della plebe, imputando loro ad invidia quello, che era puro zelo della gloria di Dio, e di Mari, come ne scrive S. Anronino nella Terza Parte della sua Storia, rigettando il detto mordace di Giovanni Villani, e di altri Scrittori, e le parole del Santo sono le seguenti : Fratres autem Predicatores &amp;amp; Minores, quia parum fidei dabant dictis miraculis, Populus, qui leviter movetur, eis detrahebat, &amp;amp; obloquebatur contra eos, adscribens invidia, quod erat vera pietatis. Ma un altro effetto ben contrario al suddetto segu dalla stupenda abbondevolezza dei miracoli, i qual a tutte le ore tirando poveri infermi, e concorrendovi moltissimi curios ad essere testimoni di soprannaturali avvenimenti, e risuonando laria di mille benedizioni, ne venne, che la Loggia destinata alla vendita del grano, era ad ogni ora ingombrata dalla folla dei divoti, onde fu costretta la Signoria a serrarela Loggia , e non ho ben certo lanno, riducendola a Chiesa, non senza grave rammarico ed opposzione di parecchi Cittadini del Gran Consglio, cui spiaceva , che fosse levata la bellezza alla pi maestosa fabbrica di Firenze , e che noi a suo tempo descriveremo. Le somme poi larghissme depositate nelle mani dei Custodi del Pilastro, ed i iasciti considerabilissimi, furono il terzo, e principal frutto delle tante miracolose grazie. Io per delle molte, e ricche offerte una sola per ora ne riferir, e fu quella, che fecero i Fiorentini nel 1348. anno della gran peste, trovandosi nei libri dei Capitani di Or S. Michele, che ascendesse alla somma di Fiorini doro 35,000. chiamata da Matteo Villani tesoro incredibile per lo valore della Moneta, che non si legge un lascito cos grosso tutto in un anno fosse fatto giammai a nestun altro Santuario di quei tempi. Ma dappoich di questa Immagine abbiamo rammentati i pregi di sua antichit , e dei suoi miracoli, ragion vuole, che parliamo degli onori ricevuti e dal Pubblico, e dai Privati ; e per non istare a narrare la lunga serie delle ordinazioni fatte dalla Repubblica riguardanti il culto d nostra Donna, io me ne sono scelte alquante delle pi memorabili, che sono contrassegni pregiatissimi di onorevolezza a questo Oratorio, rimettendo ad altra Lezione il porre in veduta le sollecitudini della Signoria in volere adornata la Loggia delle pi commendate opere dellArchitettura, Scultura, e Pittura. Principiando adunque da quellazione , la quale accrebbe divozione, e insememente rispetto grandissmo verso il Santo Tabernacolo, non vi ha dubbio, che ella fu, lessersi presa dalla Repubblica per Avvocata speciale dei Fiorentini la Madonna di Or S. Michele a voce di tutto il popolo convocato nella gran Piazza dei Signori nel 13.di Agosto del 1365. Al suono della Campana grossa, come era solito a farsi in tutte le risoluzioni gravi; e correlativa a questa elezione fu la Legge del 1366. colla quale ad ogni Cittadino statuale si ordinava di mandare a Or S. Michele un drappellone; e se era Uomo di arme, una Targa; ed a questo stesso fine retto dalla piet, che pi desiderar non si poteva verso il Santuario , per altra Legge del 1386. si aspettava ai Rettori delle Chiese, ed ai Superiori delle Religioni nella Festa dellAssunta di fare unofferta a questo Altare, sul quale nello stesso solennissimo giorno il Gonfaloniere servendo di esempio a tutti , a mezza Messa offeriva qu un regalo di frutte. Ma aumentandosi sempremai lardore in tutti di fare nuovi onori a Maria, invent dipoi il Popolo Figure di uomini ritratti al naturale alti quanto il vivo, colle teste, e mani di cera colorita, con capelliere, vesti, fogge, ed ogni altro ornamento allusanza di quei tempi, e di somiglianti voti se nempi talmente la Loggia, che per proverbio si diceva, quando si voleva significare una moltitudine di cose Sarebbonelleno mai tante quanti i Boti di Gr. S, Michele ? dei quali parla pure S. Antonino nella Parte Terza della sua Storia cos; &amp;amp; in proccssu temporis est repletus locus imaginibus cereis. E tornando alle sante Leggi della Repubblica riguardanti la venerazione, e stima di si pregiatissma Immagine , non si deve tacere quella, che obbligava gli uomini di governo a giurare suIlaltar venerabile di Or S. Michele direttamente amministrare le cose del pubblico , ed attestano i Libri di Ricordanze di quei tempi, che nessuno si Sarbbe accostato con livida coscienza per farv giuramento o pubblico, o privato, tenendosi per certo da tutti, che se la intenzione loro non fosse stata sincera, si sarebbero veduti gastighi esemplari; e trovasi unantico Statuto alla Rubrica 115. del Libro II. col quale nullo si dichiarava qualunque giuramento, che non fosse stato fatto su questo Altare: Nullo modo valeat, neque observetur, nisi tale iuramentum praestitum fuerit coram B. Virgine, &amp;amp; Capitaeneis Orti S. Michaelis. E da un Libro della Compagnia di Or S, Michele coperto di asse si ha il seguente privilegio 1329. ordina la Repubblica Fiorentina, che chi aveste ammazzato alcun suo parente, o altro congiunto, al quale aveste potuto succedere il delinquente nella Eredit , questi ne sia spogliato, e la terza parte dei beni dellucciso vadano alla Compagnia della Vergine Maria di Orto San Michele , ed il restante al Comune di Firenze. Si pens ancora dai Signori ad accrescere con isquisiti concerti di suono, e canto il pregio, e concorso alle Laudi, che si dicevano allOratorio in ogni sera, avendo la Repubblica ordinato con Legge del 1388. che i Musici della Citta, ed i Sonatori di pifferi, e viole di Palazzo nei Sabati, e nelle Feste solenni venissero ad Or S. Michele, costume per vero dire, che in qualche parte ancora in oggi si conserva. E qu mi si conceda, bench fuori del suo luogo, di aggiugnere due partite di limosine fatte dalla Compagnia di Or S. Michee , quali possono dar lume alla Storia Fiorentina, e che non seppi, quando sopra scrissi dei Capitoli della Compagnia, avendole avute dal Sig. Domenico Maria Manni, che le trov nei libri della medesima, e sono 1306 limosina Fior. ic, aila Giovanna Romita da Signa, port Chele Lapi Laudese da San Friano. Questa  la Beata da Signa, e dice il Libro a carte 49. per suo mantenimento, o per dispensarla. Nel Libro del 1307 vi ha altra limosina, e dice a persona, che sta sulle Fosse della Porta dellAlloro Oste (cio pigionale) Giotto di Bondone, questi  linsigne restaurator della Pittura. E per fine in lode di questo Oratorio riporter alcuni versi del celebre Fra Domenico da Coiella Scrittore del Secolo XV. non meno celebre per le teologiche sue opere, che per la poetica arte , come nota il dotto Autore delle Delizie degli Eruditi nel suo Tomo del 1742. al quale abbiamo grado lavere dato alle stampe del suddetto Autore il IV. Libro di Elegie sopra le Chiese Fiorentine, dove dice come appresso: &quot;Attamen apparet longe spatiosior intus, Fulget ubi Sancta Matris imago Dei. Hans miro candore nitens complectitur arcus, Sculptilibus pollens undique marmoreis Quorum compages tanta contexitur arte, Ut fibi vix aliud par videatur opus.&quot; Seconda Lezione Motivi dei Grandi nellordinare fabbriche assai magnifiche, sogliono essere il genio di voler dimostrare la loro possanza, e ricchezza, ed insiememente il sollecito impegno di accrescere ornamento alle Citr, e comodo a Cittadini. Ed appunto somiglianti fini ebbe la Repubblica Fiorentina nella fabbrica maestosa, e splendidissima di Or S. Michele. Erano i Fiorentini saliti in gran potenza per mezzo del negozio, e volendo palesare agli occhi di tutto il Mondo lo splendor del loro stato felicemente conservatosi libero, e di pi far costare ai Principi il sovrano potere fondato nel valor di molte ricchezze conquistate dalle arti, alzarono questo maraviglioso edifizio, anche in oggi uno dei principali ornamenti di Firenze, destinato gi alla conserva dei grani, e dipoi alla custodia della pubblica fede per Archivio Generale. N debbo tralasciare un altro pi nobile motivo derivato dalla piet Fiorentina verso il miracoloso Tabernacolo della Madonna di Or S. Michele, al cui onore vollero i Signori, che in questo Tempio gareggiassero le maraviglie dellArchitettura, della Scultura, e della Pittura, quali ravviseremo noi in questa Lezione. E facendomi dalla ordinazione fatta dalla Repubblica per il soprallodato fine, bench se ne sia smarrito loriginale , ne riporter una imperfetta copia enunciata nel Campione, o sia Libro Verde dei Capitani di Or S. Michele al Cap. X. Templum in statura &amp;amp; forma Palatii cum volta supra coopriente Oratorium, &amp;amp; alia deinceps, &amp;amp; tesso, atquesor formosis beccatellis, ubi tabernaculum Nostra Donna splendidssimum, &amp;amp; supra modum superbissimum, nec non miris vitris, porfido, &amp;amp; gemmis maximi valoris fundatum super Platea, ubi consueverat esse sorum denominatum Orto di S.

Advocati cuiusque Artis, &amp;amp; in medio lateris dignioris Figura Advocati Partis Guelforum, cioe S. Ludovici, ut sic B. Virog Maria defenderet &amp;amp; augeret Artes &amp;amp; Universitates buius Civitatis, ut apparet mentio de pradictis facts per Reformationem editam manu Ser Folchi Ser Antonii Notarii Populi &amp;amp; Com. Flor an. 1309 De mense Aprilis. Abbiamo adunque da cos autorevole Libro col pubblico Decreto della nuova Fabbrica la deputazione orrevole dell Arte della Seta, detta di Por S. Maria, per la felice e grandiosa esecuzione, e lepoca certa della fondazione, o piuttosto della innovazione di questo Edifizio, cio lanno 1309. A Taddeo Gaddi, in quel tempo Architetto del Pubblico tocc a fare il disegno, che se non prima del 1337 non principi a rifondare i pilastri: limpedimento fu cagionato e dallassedio di Firenze postovi dallImperatore Enrico VII. nemico dei Fiorentini fin che visse, e dalla guerra coi Pisani, e Lucchesi , e dalle discordie intestine. Ma ritornata la calma, nel 29 di Luglio del suddetto anno se ne gett la prima pietra dal Gonfaloniere Strozza di Rosso Strozzi, presente la Signoria, tutti i Magistrati, e seguitati da tutta la gente, colla benedizione del Vescovo Fiorentino Francesco Silvestri da Cingoli. Di cos solenne funzione ne parl Giovanni Villani nel Libro XI. al Capitolo 66. che tralasciando io di riferire, per non ripetere le cose di sopra dette, piuttosto riporter alquante circostanze notate da Leopoldo dei Migliore a pagina 540. come segue La funzione, che si faceva a nome dei Guelsi, che erano quelli che dominavano la Citt, mai ridottasi in s felice stato quanto allora, si accompagn anche col getto di monete doro, e di argento, coniate da una parte con ledifzio , e queste lettere : Ut magnificentia Populi Flor.  Artis, &amp;amp; Artificum ostendatur, e dallaltra parte lArmi della Repubblica, e del medesimo Popolo, e si leggeva : Reip. &amp;amp; Popili Honor &amp;amp; Decus. Chi lo racconta, che per avventura fu presente, dice di pi, come anche lAmbasciatore della Citt di Arezzo , vi buttasse non so che moneta piccola. E sin qu lAutore della Firenze illustrata. In quanti anni poi fosse la Fabbrica ridotta alla sua perfezione e vaghezza, non  possibile il determinarlo; conciosiacosach vi si ravvisano tralle pitture alquante di Iacopo da Casentino, di Lorenzo di Credi, di Andrea del Sarto, e di Gio: Antonio Sogliani; fra i tondi, tre se ne veggono di Luca della Robbia, e tralle Statue parecchie di Donatello, e dei suoi Discepoli, che furono tutti Artefici del Secolo XV Onde fa duopo il dire, che o vi fossero innovazioni sempre pi belle, o che tardi assai si desse lultimo compimento al nobile disegno. Avvi pure un altro dubbio circa chi ne fosse lArchitetto: imperciocch in una cartella in Chiesa leggesi Autore Arnolfo di Lapo; Leopoldo del Migliore ne d la lode ad Andrea Orcagna, ed il Baidinucci ne fa Architettore Taddeo Gaddi. Ma io credo, che tutti e tre dicano il vero, solo che distinguiamo i tempi, stabilendo che nel 1284 giusta tutti gli Scrittori, Arnolfo per ordine della Signoria fabbricasse la Loggia, in secondo luogo, che nel 1337 Taddeo Gaddi ne rifondasse i pilastri, che erano di mattoni, rivestendogli di pietra, e di marmi, e per fine morto il Gaddi nel 1350. giusta il Vasari, o nel 1352 secondo il Baldinucci, vi lavorasse lOrcagna, che appunto allaltare della Madonna leggessi questi essere stato Architetto nel 1359. Andreas Cionis Pictor buius Oratorii Arcbimagifter 1359 Circa poi la spesa, scrive il Varchi, che arrivasse ad ottantasei mila fiorini di oro da stimarsi grandissima in ordine al valore della moneta di quei tempi, e ventimila in ridurla da Loggia ad uso di Chiesa, come si  detto di sopra: e donde si cavasse questo danaro, senza aggravare il Comune di nuovo dazio, io trovo nei Libri di Provvisioni agli anni 1339 e 1350. che furono assegnate allArte della Seta per proseguir la fabbrica certe gabelle chiamate delle sette Piazze, della Mallevadoria dellArmi, e che il Villani le addimanda Gabellette, quasi che con questo diminutivo significar volesse, come il poco assegnato , avesse moltiplicato tanto per la felicit del Commercio, da essersi potuta alzar Mole cos eccelsa. Mi piace per rammentare unentrata, che ha dellincredibile, ma ella  registrata nel libro detto Campione a car 14. ed inoltre dal Villani  notata al Lib. XI. Cap. 91. Questa entrata era la spazzatura della Loggia di Or S. Michele, e prestatura di bigonce , dalla quale cavavansi ogni anno 750 fiorini di oro, dovendosi ancora qu comprendere le stupende limosine, che si facevano dai devoti alla miracolosa Immagine, porzione delle quali si applicava al magnifico ornamento di questo sovrano, e ricchissimo Tempio. E veramente si mostrer convenirgli questa lode, e molto maggiore ancora, per quel che diremo in descriverne le qualit. La forma sua  quasi quadrangolare, lunga essendo braccia 42 e larga 32. Si alza dal piano della strada alla cima braccia 80 tutta veggendosi incrostata di pietra forte riquadrata, di quella , che resistendo allacqua, ed ai rigori delle stagioni, se ne murarono, dice il Vasari , quasi tutti gli edifici alla gotica, che si fecero in Toscana in quei tempi, della quale Architettura barbara  anco questa Torre, sebbene in essa si vede un dei primi miglioramenti dellArte, nel ricominciar, che ella fece a rinvigorire, e pigliar forza, osservandovisi gli archi, che lasciato il sello acuto sono girati con grazia a porzione di circolo, sopra a pilastri principali della volta vi sono due ordini di Finestroni adornati nei vani di colonnette di marmo, veggendosi nei triangoli dei frontespizi principali le armi della Repubblica, e della Parte Guelfa reiterate in pi luoghi, ed ancora sonovi quelle della Casa Reale di Napoli, che  uno scudo dimezzato per lo lungo, da una parte pieno di gigli, dallaltra di listre in piano per il Regno di Ungheria, posseduto, allorach questa Loggia si fabbricava, da Lodovico di Angi figliolo di Carlo, che fu tanto amico dei Fiorentini, Protettore, e fermezza del loro stato in favore dei Guelfi, e per segno di gratitudine la Repubblica vi alz quelle armi, essendo questa la maggior benevolenza, che professasse mai Firenze verso nessunaltro Potentato. Finisce la fabbrica con una corona di rose traforate, che sportando in fuori ,e retta con grazia su certi beccatelli, vi rigira intorno a guisa di parapetto, o sponda. E venendo al terreno ricorre attorno un imbasamento di pietra alto da terra poco pi di quattro braccia fino alle nicchie, nelle quali sonovi le Statue dei Santi Avvocati delle Arti, parte di metallo, e parte di marmo, di tutto rilievo, essendo alte pi del vivo, e per condurle a perfezione vi si stanc per dir cos lindustria dei primi Maestri, e Professori di quei tempi, senza risparmio di spesa in ricompensa del loro valore, parlandosene in un Libro alle Riformagioni segnato F. come appresso Sapendosi quanto importi dar cuore a chi operando con industria per mero parto dellintelletto, cerca a lasciar di se onoratissimo nome, e fama alla Patria per mezzo di fatture rare: si vuole, che largamente se ne ricompensino quelli, che gi sono stati eletti a far pompa del loro talento, e sapere intorno alle Statue di Or S. Michele. E per dar ragguaglio di queste Statue principiando dalla parte di Levante a venire dalla via dei Calzaioli, nella prima nicchia evvi S. Luca, segue S. Tommaso, e poi S. Gio; Batista ; verso Mezzod la prima  di S. Giovanni Evangelista, di S. Giorgio la seconda, viene S. Iacopo, e la quarta  di S. Marco: dalla parte del Magistrato della Lana nel primo pilastro incontrasi S. L, dopo vedesi S. Stefano, ed in terzo luogo S. Matteo: e voltando a Tramontana la prima nicchia  vacante per un certo caso, che poi diremo; la seconda  dei quattro Santi , dopo la quale evvi S. Filippo, e nellultima San Piero. E ripigliando da S. Luca, ella  di getto fatta da Giovan Bologna per lArte dei Giudic e Notai, o sia del Proconsolo, la cui arme  una stella di oro, che empie tutto il campo di argento, intagliata negli angoli della base. S. Tommaso  di Andrea del Verrocchio discepolo di Donatello per non dire emolo del Maestro, tanto  vivo il Santo, che sembra camminare portato dallamore a toccare la piaga di Cristo: fu fatto a spese della Mercanzia , che ha per impresa una stella rossa sopra una balla bianca: in virt di un pubblico Decreto in questa nicchia doveasi collocare S. Lodovico ; il perch si recedesse da questordine non lo sappiamo; bens per mercede dellArtefice ho letto nel Campione Verde, che nel 1483 si ordina, che Andrea sia di tal fattura sodisfatto fino in 800 fiorini Iarghi. II S. Giovan Batista spetta allArte dei Mercatanti, gi Consoli di Calimala, che portano unAquila di oro sopra una balla bianca in campo ross: la fattura  del Ghiberti, il cui nome  scritto nel lembo dellabito: ma convien confessare essere figura languida in comparazione delle altre sue opere meravigliose. Il S. Giovanni Evangelista anchegli di bronzo  opera di Baccio da Montelupo, che lo fece per l Arte della Seta con diligenza estrema e felice , della quale Arte limpresa  una porta rossa in campo di argento. Segue il S. Giorgio, il quale prima stava nella sua nicchia a Tramontana molto proporzionata alla sua grandezza, e poscia diremo la cagione della traslazione; la fecero fare i Corazzai, e Spadai, che fanno per arme un giaco, ed uno stocco : questa figura  stimata da tutti la pi bella, ed oltre a quel che ne dice il Vasari, il Bocchi ne ha fatto un trattato intitolato LEccelenza della Statua di S. Giorgio fatta da Donatello, che fu stampato nel 1584. dal Marescotti. Alla vicina nicchia viene la Statua di S. Iacopo dellArte dei Vaiai, i quali in un campo di azzurro fanno per arme una pecora bianca, e molti vai: piace assai la maniera di questo Santo lavorato da Nanni di Antonio del Bianco. Di Donatello  il S. Marco, di cui Michelagnolo, dicono, che dicesse: che se tale era il sembiante del Santo vivo gli si poteva creder tutto quanto aveva scritto, tanto mostra cera di galantuomo. Del soprallodato Nanni  San L lavorato per lArte dei Maniscalchi, come lo dimostra lArme loro, che  un paio di tanaglie nere, ed appi della Statua vedesi un basso rilievo di alcuni occupati ad unincudine. Ammirabile  il S. Stefano, degna opera del Ghiberti, in premio della quale ebbe anche la grazia di fare laltra che segue di S. Matteo, quella  dellArte della Lana avente per Arme una pecora bianca con banderola bianca, e croce rossa in campo azzurro; questa  dell Arte del Cambio, la cui divisa  un campo seminato di monete di oro; e nellArchivio di detta Arte si conserva un Libro, nel quale oltre il leggersi lallogazione della Statua al suddetto Ghiberti, trovasi il maneggio di quei Consoli per ottenere questa Nicchia, che era stata data per lavanti allArte dei Fornai per collocarvi la figura di S. Lorenzo loro Protettore: ma stante che ella era Arte poverissima, e che n di presente, n per lavvenire avrebbero potuto fare una grande spesa, la Signoria nel 21 di Giugno del 1419 essendo Gonfaloniere Niccol di Franco Sacchetti, col consenso dei medesimi Fornai concedette la Nicchia allUniversit dei Cambiatori per farvi la figura di S. Matteo, per la quale ebbe Lorenzo 650. fiorini di oro. Sono anche da osservarsi su questa Nicchia due statuette di marmo lavorate con lode da Niccol Aretino. Dopo questa viene la nicchia vuota, ove non  rimaso, che nella base un prodigioso mezzo rilievo di Donatello, rappresentante S. Giorgio, che occide il Drago, lodato da Raffaello Borghini con queste parole si pu mirare, ma non imitare I quattro Santi sono del Nanni, fatti da quattro Arti di Maestri, di scure, o accetta, di scarpello, di mestola, e di altri strumenti fabbrili. La invenzione di collocarveli, che portava sapere per la strettezza del luogo, pose in disperazione lArtefice, ma il di lui Maestro Donatello colla sola ricompensa duna cena, a forza di alcuni colpi industriosi scanton di quelle Statue a chi la spalla, a chi le braccia, talch ponendo luna per cos dire addosso allaltra, le commesse di modo, che non solo copri lerrore del discepolo, ma riscosse stima, e meraviglia da tutti. Non  dispregevole il S. Filippo, che gli  allato nellaltra nicchia, fatto dal medesimo Nanni alla Universit dei Calzolai, quali portano tre listre nere in piano di argento. Ma di vero il S. Piero dellArte dei Beccai, quali alzano per arme un becco rampante in campo di argento,  fatto da Donatello con tanto sapere, che  tenuto dal Vasari opera mirabile e rarissima, dove  un panneggiare graziosissimo corrispondente allattitudine del corpo, in guisa, che meglio non istanno i panni indosso ad uomo vivente. Questo apparato di Statue unire cos, ed esposte al pubblico si vede in poche Citt, e molti sono venuti di lontani paesi a bella posta per vederle, confessando esser loro parute una Scuola di cose rare da potersene pigliar copia con qualche riserva; e per cagione del rispetto, che convenevolmente pretesero i Fiorentini, che si portasse a s preziose nicchie, abbiamo lo Statuto, che impone pena a chi o vi tirasse sassi, o facess loro qualche oltraggio. Bella veduta ancora fanno i vani degli Archi tra un pilastro, e laltro, adornati di quattro altissime colonne, su ciascuna delle quali posa una Statua di un braccio e mezzo di altezza, che in tutte sono quaranta, veggendosi i capitelli e dei pilastri, e delle colonne ornati a foglia di acanto rustica, siccome vaghissimi sono i rabeschi, che empiono gli archi, restando da osservarsi sopra le nicchie le pitture nei dodici tondi, totalmente guaste, eccettuate tre che sono di terra inverniciata di Luca della Robbia, rappresentanti una Madonna col Bambino in collo sopra il pilastro di S. Giorgio, lArme della Repubblica sopra S. Tommaso, e sopra S. Giovanni Evangelista la divisa dellArte di Por Santa Maria. Resterebbemi a ragionare dellaccennata traslazione in Chiesia della Statua della Madonna dalla nicchia della Universit dei Medici, e Speziali, nella quale oggi si vede collocato San Giorgio. Ma dovendosi in altra Lezione assembrare i moltiplichi pregi rilucenti nell interiore de Tempio, in essa parleremo ancora della Sroria di questo Simolacro, riportando qu per fine in lode di tale Meravigliosa fabbrica altri versi del celebre Poeta Domenicano, e sono i seguenti: Nunc ubi magna domus pracelsa turris ad instar Fertur in aereas altius una plagas. Qua licet ex omni videatur splendida parte Sanctorum Statuas dum soris ipsa tenet. Attamen apparet longe speciosor intus Fulget ubi Sancta Matris Imago Dei. Terza Lezione Il ragionare degli interiori pregi di questa Chiesa con ordine, non si pu quasi fare senza deferenza al prodigioso Altare della Madonna di Or S. Michele gi da noi descritto nella prima Lezione di questa Storia, dovendo qui aggiungere ai sopraddetti titoli, i laudevoli usi fatti di sue grandi ricchezze assembrate nel florido stato della Repubblica, ed il sacro quotidiano servizio a quellAltare. E per farmi dal primo ne noter un lolo documento indicante i gran tesori spes in opere pie dai Superiori dellOratorio, mercech i Capitani oltre lo splendido, e nobile mantenimento della Chiesa, potettero somministrare grandi somme di danaro per le fabbriche dei Monasteri di Chiarito, di Lapo, e di San Giorgio, i quali sono oggi reputati al pari di ogni altro Monastero esemplare di Firenze, constando queste fondazioni dai rogiti di Ser Michele di Ghirolfo da Lucardo 1342 e di Ser Salvestro Salvesfri 1405 nellArchivio Generale. Circa poi al secondo punto riferir mi piace la istituzione fatta dalla Rep nel 1415. di una Collegiata di dieci Preti, e due Cherici, con un Capo loro chiamato Proposto; la quale erezione trovasi registrata in un Libro coperto di asse nellArchivio dei Capitani, ove s legge ancora , che fino a quei tempo lOratorio era stato ufiziato da un solo Prete col titolo di Sagrestano. Questi Preti hanno il privilegio dei Cappuccio pavonazzo, e collintervento dei Musici assistono alle solite Laudi di Maria nelle Feste, ed in ogni Sabato alio scoprimento della sacra Immagine col canto delle Litanie, nel qual tempo ardono 26 candele con questo ordine di 12 allAltare, 6 ai viticci, ed otto alla ghirlanda, siccome nella Messa alla Consacrazione sempre debbono accendersi due Ceri per legato di Luca di Filippo Carnesecchi Gentiluomo Fiorentino, il quale nel suo Testamento del 1601, rogato da Ser Antonio di Ser Chello dice Lascio due doppieri di cera gialla di libbre 15 in perpetuo da accendersi alla Madonna di Or S. Michele nel tempo della elevazione dell Ostia. E passando ora a rammentar quanto di sacro, e di bello avvi in questOratorio dir, che appoggiato al pilastro, che sta allato a questa Cappella, trovasi un Crocifisso di legno in gran venerazione appresso i Fiorentini, con tutto che sia mal fatto, di maniera antica, alto pi del vivo. Credesi sullautorit di tutti gli Scrittori della vita del Santo Arcivescovo Antonino, che egli fusse consueto andarvi ad orare, quando era fanciullo, che in quellet vedesi dipinto appi della Croce. Non ci pare per di potere acconsentire a chi senza autorevole documento disse, che quel Crocifisso parlasse pi fiate al Santo, e molto meno che sia lavorato del legno di quellOlmo secco, il quale rifior nella traslazione del corpo di S. Zanobi, credo per al Rondinelli, che nel suo Ragguaglio della peste dice come segue I Frati di S. Marco molti Venerd in processione andarono al Crocifisso di Or S. Michele, al quale S. Antonino fanciulleto orava ringraziar debbo queBenefattori, i quali nellanno 1714 fecero a questo divino Simolacro un Tabernacolo di ricco intaglio attorno tutto dorato con baldacchino, e pendoni pavonazzi, e frangia di oro. L dirimpetto nel secondo pilastro osservasi una figura a fresco del buon ladrone, che si trover in pochi luoghi cos dipinto allantica, avendolo il pittore non solamente confitto in Croce coi chiodi, ma legate le gambe con funi, acciocch non si confondesse con Cristo Ges, e cos not il Molano essere stata la Chiesa consueta di fare . Questa pittura per fu qu collocata per la seguente cagione, notata 300 anni sono nei Libri della Compagnia della Croce al Tempio, e ricopiata da Vincenzio del Corno Gentiluomo Fiorentino amatore delle cose antiche nei suoi Ricordi, e leggesi negli Spogli di Leopoldo del Migliore, come segue 1361. N. N. condannato alla forca, era di Famiglia pi che mediocremente civile; poche ore prima di esser condotto al pratello, parl ad un Fratello della Compagnia dei Neri solita ad assistere queo da doversene fare pubblico spettacolo, e dissegli come in sua casa appi del Ponte Vecchio aveva in un cassne riposta una somma di danaro, e che la sua intenzione era di voler far dipingere in Or S. Michele al pilastro vicino allOratorio una figura del buon ladrone, acci pregasse Dio, che gli usasse in quel breve respiro quella misericordia, che rese lui beato. Chi esegu ii Legato ha scritto questo ricordo, Questa Immagine fu dipinta da Iacopo Landini da Prato Vecchio detto il Cafentino, di lui essendo quasi tutte Ie altre, toltene alcune poche, di cui faremo qui menzione. Di Iacopo adunque  la volta, ove rappresent sedici tra Patriarchi e Profeti, i quali posano surun campo di azzurro oltramarino, colore che cost assai, per la fresca invenzione ritrovata di estrarlo dalle preziose pietre di lapislazzuli; n mancarono Cittadini statuali di quei tempi, che ne mormorarono , paruta loro una spesa buttata , anzi uno strapazzo del danaro della Santissima Immagine: ma questo parlare ardito dispiacque tanto al popolo, che ne volle, dice il Cambi, una pubblica sodisfazione allonore oltraggiato di Maria con la prigionia di uno di casa Foraboschi. E tornando a Iacopo di Casentino, suoi sono parimente i moltissimi Santi dipinti lun sopra laltro negli archi, tra un pilastro e laltro , e nelle facce dei 16 pilastri, fuori che alquanti pochi, come il S. Bartolommeo lavoro finissimo di mano di Lorenzo di Credi, e al secondo pilastro in un ovato S. Maria Maddalena portata in Cielo dagli ngioli di mano di Andrea del Sarto; siccome il S. Stfano tra le due porte fu fatto dal Poppi, il quale fece ancora le due tavole, che sono in Coro, di Cristo, e di S. Giova Batista; dei Sogliani  il S. Martino rimpetto a S. Stefano, e suo credes il S. Agostino in mezzo del Coro, bench vi sia chi lo giudica dell AIbertinelli. Sotto lorgano Agnolo Gaddi pittore in quei tempi di grido rappresent alla parete Cristo, che disputa in mezzo ai Dottori. N io voglio tralasciare di riferire ci che il Dottor Brocchi rammenta essere accaduto alla figura di S. Verdiana, la quale si vede al pilastro della cantonata di questa Chiesa riguardante il Mezzod accanto alla immagine di S. Lucia. Essendo ella per lantichit assai guasta fu fatta rifiorire nei nostri tempi, ma con grande discapito della Istoria, posciach il Pittore scancell la iscrizione, che vi era sotto scritta a caratteri gotici, e quello, che fu pi strano, alla Santa mutato si vede labito di secolare , che aveva, in tonaca Religiosa. Considerabile poi  la Cappella di S. Anna erettavi a spese del Comune dalla banda di Tramontana, per dovervisi commemorare in perpetuo latto di unazione la pi importante, che accader possa in una Repubblica libera , che fu la cacciata del Tiranno Duca di Atene, ed occupator violento del Dominio Fiorentino, seguita, giusta tutti gli Scrittori, nei 26, Luglio del 1343 giorno di SantAnna, la quale venne per questa grazia onorata fra i Protettori principali col titolo di Propitia , &amp;amp; F. utrix libertatis Civitatis Florentina; e per, come apparisce alle Riformagioni Lib. B. del 1349 si fece il Decreto della Signorsa di spendere tremila fiorini di oro per la erezione in Or S. Michele di una Cappella ridotta nel 1526 a miglior ordine dai Capitani, veggendosi sullAltare isolato la Santa figurata in marmo bianco p alta del vivo in atto di tenere in collo la Vergine Maria, che porta in seno il Bambino Ges, opera lodatissima di Francesco da S. Gallo. A 26 di Luglio la Signoria vinterveniva ogni anno a offerta con tutte le Capitudini delle Arti, si correva un palio, ed altre cose di somma allegrezza facevansi in quel giorno, ordinate nello Statuto fatto nel 1343 ai 28 di Ottobre con questa bella introduzione di parole : Pro houore Reip. &amp;amp; ad perpetuam memoriam libertatis Civitatis Florentia, &amp;amp; ut Civium mentibus sit infixum, qualiter die S. Anna de mense Iulii Populus Flor per Dei gratiam, &amp;amp; virtutem bonorum, a Tyrannide Ducis Atbernarum liberatus &amp;amp;c. Ed in una tavola della Chiesa leggesi, che in questa Festa si espone la Reliquia della Santa, che si d a baciare alla Centuria dei Fratelli, e Sorelle della Santissima Trinit. Passandosi ora ad altra Cappella,  duopo, che io mi faccia a riferire quel tanto, che ho promedso nellantecedente Lezione, parlando della nicchia degli Speziali, perch una Madonna a sedere col Figlio in collo standovi collocata, e lavorata gi da Simone da Fiesole allievo del Brunellesco, fu trasferita in Chiesa , e messa ad una delle due porte grandi chiusa per formarne una Cappella; e la cagione di ci fu la seguente. Nellanno 1628 il popolo a voce di parecchi, che asserivano con giuramento di aver veduta questa Statua muovere, e battere gli occhi, corse in grandissimo numero, ed in tanta folla di giorno, e di notte, che s ebbe prima a sbarrar le strade per isfuggire il tumulto, gridando ognuno misericordia, che fu uno di quei preludi della peste, che venne dipoi a Firenze nel 1630. Poscia per deviare la gente devota, che non si sarebbe mai partita di l, si pigli dal Granduca Ferdinando espediente di trasferirla dentro. Del miracoloso avvenimento se ne fece processo per ordine dellArcivescovo Alessandro Marzimedici, ed uno dei disaminati, che depose di aver veduta la Statua aprire e serrare pi volte gli occhi, fu il Canonico Cavaliere Giovanni Guidacci. A questa figura di Nostra Donna stando fuori nella sua nicchia accadde un altro caso in tempo di Repubblica, che in due versi inciso appi del marmo anche in oggi si legge, e fu che un Marrano Giudeo di bel giorno senza tema di esser veduto la percosse con un ferro, ma il far ci, e il vederlo morto, strascinato fu tutto un tempo; e questo sacrilego fatto viene anche scritto da Forese d Ribatta nei Libri di sue Ricordanze, nelle quali vien di pi a questo particolare, che il corpo di costui fosse buttato per ultimo vilipendio nella fogna di S. Stefano. E Ie parole intagliate nella base del marmo per memoria di questo fatto sono le qui appresso: Hanc ferro effigiem petiit ludeus, &amp;amp; Index Ipse fibi vulgo dilaniatus obit MccccLxxXXlII. E conciosacosach in queste Lezioni si abbia frequentemente rammentato il titolo di Or S. Michele , non sia grave a chi legge , che io riporti lorigine di questo nome, come contenente non ispregevoli notizie, e specialmente dellantichit, lo che non so se veramente lo dicano le Istorie, che di O. S. M. favellano: e per dispensandomi dallesaminare il dubbio, se quivi gi dal 750 vi fosse unOratorio dedicato al Santo Arcangelo, per camminare sul sicuro con documenti autorevoli, dir primieramente, che poco dopo il mille vi era una Chiesa Parrocchiale, la quale contigua ad un Orto fu detta San Michele in Orto , venerabile per vero dire pi di ogni altra, che ne fosse in Firenze con somigliante titolo, situata ella essendo nel pi nobilitato luogo della Citt; e che fosse Parrocchia  verit assai chiara dagli Strumenti antichissimi, che la dichiarano tale, come in un Testamento nellArchivio di Badia n. 25. tra i Testimoni leggesi: Filippus Pieri Ranerii pop. S. Michaelis in orto 1100. Ed in molti contratti vetusti della famiglia dei Mozzi qu abitanti innanzi che passassero di l di Arno a S. Gregorio , trovansi accennati Populi San Michele in Orto. Come ella poi passasse ai Monaci Cisterciensi della Badia di S. Silvestro di Nonantola, non mi sono avvenuto sin qui a trovarlo: il vero si , che Papa Innocenzio III. in una sua Bolla data in Viterbo nel 1209 gi esistente presso le Monache del Paradiso, indicata dal Migliore a pag 540 conferma a detti Monaci con molte altre Chiese questa ancora di S. Michele: Ecclesias S. Felicis, S. Martini in Mamma, &amp;amp; S. Michaelis intus Flor. La Repubblica poscia per suoi antichi diritti ne dovette riassumere il padronato, levandolo ai Cisterciensi; per la qual cosa segu qualche disgusto con Roma, trovandosi alle Riformagioni una lettera del 1249. di Papa Innocenzio IV veduta dal Migliore, nella quale esortasi la Repubblica a render la Chiesa alla Badia di Nonantola, insieme col Castello di S. Martino. E quali fossero gli effetti di questa esortazione si pu ravvisare dalle risoluzioni della Repubblica. Conciosiach avendo la Signoria bisogno di una piazza per la vendita del grano, e di stanzoni per conservarlo, e considerato questo luogo molto opportuno, ne fece spianare la Chiesa, ordinando di darsi principio ad una Loggia, della quale parla il Migliore a pagina 530 cos : Col disegno di Arnolfo Panno 1284 che si era fondata sopra lantica Chiesa di S. Michele. Ma perch non si perdesse la memoria di Chiesa cos antica, debbo qui notare, come nello stesso tempo volle la Repubblica, che Arnolfo ne fabbricasse unaltra rimpetto alla nuova Loggia ; che  lOratorio presente, detto S Michele vecchio, ma in oggi S. Carlo per la cagione seguente. Si era di fresco canonizzato S. Carlo da Paolo. E penetratasene la fama di sua santit per ogni dove, con riempiersi di divozione al Santo le Citt principali, e massimamente Firenze, che in materia di Religione fu sempre mai ferventissima, quando il Cardinale Federigo Borromei Arcivescovo di Milano ricordevole dellantico passaggio da questo Stato a quello di Milano, che fecero i Borromei, e del soggiorno fatto in questa Citt dal Santo , volle, che delle Reliquie, le prime che fossero portate fuori di Milano, si mandassero a Firenze, che furono un gran pezzo della Camicia , chegli aveva addosso quando mor, e del suo sangue raccolto in una spugna sparato che fu. La solennit nel riceverle fu grandissima al pari della gi conceputa divozione nel popolo, ma prevedendosi, che il luogo, ove queste si dovealo collocare sarebbe stato anguito assai per celebrarvi la sacra traslazione, e Cosimo II. volendo anchegli dare un segno al suo solito di divozione, e grato mostrarsi alle cortesi offerte del Cardinale, lAltezza sua sottoscrisse un Memoriale alla Compagnia dei Lombardi, cui erano esse Reliquie dirette , concedendo ai Fratelli loratorio di San Michele, come luogo pi capace della Chiesa di S. Miniato tra le Torri, ove allora la Compagnia si ragunava, trasferitavi gi da S. Pier del Murrone, oggi detto S. Giovannino in Via di S. Gallo, e volle Sua Altezza, che i Capitani di Or S. Michele, ai quali spettava il dominio dellOratorio, ne facessero la donazione per Decreto del 1616 contenente alcune condizioni, cio di non mai la Compagnia mettervi alcuna sua Arme, e dellonorificenza annua di un censo di cera da darsegli nel giorno di S. Michele. Allora fu levata dallAltar Maggiore la tavola antichissima di Buonamico Bufalmacco rappresentante un Cristo morto, venendo trasferita sulla porta al di dentro, e fu collocata in suo luogo la tavola di Matteo Roselli, ove  S. Carlo vestito da Cardinale in una gloria figurata lucida, e risplendente con molti Angioli attorno, e fra essi nel primo luogo S. Michele con le sue insegne, secondo i patti, sperando cos i Capitani di conservare vivo il titolo di S. Michele, prevedendosi , come  seguito, che la nuova venerazione a S. Carlo aveva a far dimenticare lOratorio di S. Michele, il quale  stato illustrato da Papa Alessandro VII nellanno nono del suo pontificato di una perpetua Indulgenza per i Fratelli nella Festa di S. Carlo. La Tribuna dellAltar grande, come dimostra lArme di una Colonna seminata di Vai affissa nellarco con licenza dei Capitani, era stata in antico eretta dai Pilli Famiglia Consolare, della quale parla Dante nel Canto. del Paradiso: grande era gi la Colonna del Vajo. E nelle Scritture di Or S. Michele si legge Altar Maggiore dellOratorio di S. Michele fatto in esecuzione del Testamento di Messer Bindo dei Pilli nellanno 1376. Ed a man manca entrando  osservabile una Tavola di Fabbrizio Boschi, avendo egli in essa effigiata con bel disegno e vivacit di colori la presentazione di Cristo al Tempio. NellArchitrave della porta in segno del Padronato dei Capitani vedesi scolpita Ia loro divisa a caratteri di bronzo dorato, che sono le tre lettere O.S.M. E tornando finalmente alla Loggia di Or. S. Michele, che si disse sostenere con 16 pilastri la gran torre fatta per il grano, e che poscia dal Granduca Cosimo I. giudicata per luogo atto a poter salvare le scritture dal fuoco, e dallacqua fu destinata per Archivio Generale non posso tralasciare le lodi, che ne derivarono alla gloriosa memoria di questo Principe. Si pubblic adunque una medaglia colleffigie del Granduca, ed il suo nome; e nel rovescio la Porta dellArchivio aperta con molti libri in essa fgurati per Protocolli con corona ai Frontespizio, e lettere attorno, che dicevano: Publica Fidei. Evvi ancora a caratteri di oro una Iscrizione sulla Porta dellArchivio situata in Calimala, e dice: ARCHIVIVM HOC PERPETVITATI PVBLICORVM MONIMENTORVM CONSERVANDAE DICATVM SERENISS COSMVS MED. EREXIT. QVAMPRIMVM MAGNVS DVX HETRVRIAE SALVTATVS REGIAQVE corona insignitvs est mdlxix. E similmente alla Porta, che mette nello Stanzone delle Scritture, dove non si ammettono se non i Ministri senza lume, e senza fuoco, si legge pure a lettere indorate. FIDEI PVBLTCAE SERENIS.S. COSMVS MED. MAGNVS DVX ETRVRIAE EREXIT KAL. MARTIIS MDLXIX. E io quando mi credeva di avere qui terminato le mie Memorie Istoriche intorno ad Or S. Michele, debbo a queste arrogere una indispensabile notizia, senza la quale chi legge potrebbe prendere unequivoco sopra gli Ufiziali di Or San Michele. Conciosiach due Magistrati eranvi di simigliante appellazione, al primo dei quali spettava la cura di detta Piazza, o Loggia circa la vendita del grano, e delle biade , i quali durarono a cosi chiamarsi sino a tanto, che i Signori non fecero chiuderla la loggia mutata avendola in Chiesa, ed altrove trasferito il pubblico granaio; Al secondo Magistrato apparteneva il buon governo della Compagnia, e dellOratorio della Madonna di Or S. Michele, con un ampla iurisdizione sopra i beni donati alla Santissima Immagine. E questa differenza di ufizi apparisce nella Carnera Fiscale al Libro segnato 1344 contenente diverse scritture, biglietti, e cedole dei Priori al Podest di Firenze, nel qual libro sotto il d 27 di Febbraio leggonsi estratti per Ufiziali della loggia del grano di Or. S. Michele i seguenti: Filippus Rochi de Capponibus, Zenobius Lapi Risaliti, Dominicus Rizzini Fagioli, &amp;amp; Mattheus Roselli Pictor Officiales extracti pro Comuni Flor. ad Officium Platea O. Si M. pro termino, &amp;amp; tempore quatuor mensium. E con tale documento spiacemi di dover notare su questo proposito lo sbaglio del chiarissimo Leopoldo del Migliore alla pagina 369 della sua Firenze Illustrata, nella quale Egli scrisse, che il suddetto Matteo da Rosello fu dei Capitani della Madonna di Or S. Michele, nel Ruolo dei quali, che v copiato nelle mani di pi studiosi, non si vede mai il detto Matteo. Ma se questi non trovasi al numero dei Capitani della Madonna, meritava per di essere messo da Giorgio Vasari nel numero dei Pittori, cos denominato nella sopra riferita elezione. E tra le opere di lui  considerata la dipintura dellInferno, che aveva fatto nella Chiesa di S. Michele dei Visdomini giusta il suddetto Leopoldo del Migliore alla detta Pagina, dove dice come segue Dipinti al naturale erano in 5, quello inferno molti uomini tristi di quella et, fra quali il Duca di Atene coi suoi seguaci, come traditori della Signoria d Firenze nel pi caro che  la libert, o ladri, !e male lingue, e quei che si erano mostrati contrari al pubblico interesse, che chi gli aveva conosciuti diceva, quello  il tale, cos bene vi erano state portate le somiglianze loro dal naturale: pass per proverbio finch la pittura stette in piedi, il dirsi per Firenze, gli  ritratto in S. Michele, e tanto basti. Era questo lavoro stato fatto da Matteo di Roffello Pittore antico e civile. Ma tornando ai Capitani della Madonna di O. S. M. non debbo tralasciar di avvertire, come questi sono stati pure aboliti, avendo il Nostro Imperatore dara la soprintendenza del Sacro Tempio ad un solo Gentiluomo, il quale presentemente  ii Sig. Domenico Baldigiani. E per modo di appendice rammenter qu la Ven. Congrega dei Preti detta della Visitazione, la quale riconosce il suo principio nel 1494. a d 24. di Febbraio da alcuni Sacerdoti della Collegiata di Or S. Michele, e questa Congrega composta di 40 Preti senza pi si aduna nella Chiesa di S. Michele in Palchetto, dove sulla porta leggesi il seguente titolo. CONGREGATIO VISITATIONIS PRESBYTERORVM.",

THE BIGALLO AND THE COMPAGNIA DELLA MISERICORDIA Documents The Building and its Decorations A.S.F., Carte Strozziane, Magliabecchiana, XXXVII, cod. 300, 132 (Poggi, Bigallo, 194, n. 1; Saalman, The Bigallo, 44, n. 1). A record transcribed by Senator Carlo Strozzi about the purchase of a building across from the Baptistery of S. Giovanni. The buyers were members of the confraternity of the Misericordia and the seller was Baldinaccio Adimari, an aristocrat whose family owned most of the buildings just south of the Piazza del Duomo, along the road that connected the cathedral to the Piazza della Signoria by the river. 1321. Libro della Compagnia della Misericordia dove sono notati tutti quelli che aiutorno comperare la casa dirimpetto alla porta del Battesimo di S. Giovanni, comperata da Baldinaccio Adimari, dove hoggi si ragunano i capitani della Misericorida. 1321 et 1322 si fece la detta compera. A.S.F., Bigallo, II, 1, 26r. September 16, 1351 (Poggi, Bigallo, 225; Saalman, The Bigallo, 44-45, n. 2). A neighbor, Giovanni degli Albizzi Pellegrini, bequeaths to the confraternity a house that he owns on the Corso degli Adimari (running south from the Piazza del Duomo to the Piazza della Signoria), along with a modest monetary gift for the Misericordia. Giovanni refers to himself as a member of the parish of S. Cristofori, the neighborhood just to the west of the Baptistery and the Bishops Palace: in one sentence, a Florentine refers to himself by his family name and lineage, neighborhood and street name, parish church, and charitable interest. 1351, 16 Settembre. Item dicta die Iohannes Albizi Pellegrini populi S. Cristofori obtulit se et domum suam positam super canto Cursus de Adimaribus societati nostrae et fuit factus familiaris perpetuus (cum certis pactis) cum salario 8 lib. fp. quolibet mense . A.S.F., Bigallo, II, 1, 28r. January 28 1352 (Poggi, Bigallo, 226; Saalman, The Bigallo, 45, n.3). A notary, together with witnesses that include a canon named Don Bartolo, describes the location and general size of the building that now houses the confraternity of the Misericordia. Located on the corner where the Corso degli Adimari meets the Piazza del Duomo (here called the Piazza S. Giovanni, or the plateae s. Iohannis), the structure extends some 10 braccia, or roughly 20 feet (about 6 meters).  Item die 28 Ianuari magister Iohannes ser Pieri, mensurator Communis, et magister Thomasus Iacobi Passerae, magister communis, dederunt, praesentibus domino Bartolo canonico maioris ecclesiae flor. et aliis presbiteris et pluribus vicinis, situm edificando oratorium super canto plateae s. Iohannis capiendo braccia 10 terreni vel circa, incipiendo ex latere viae de Adimaribus iuxta columpnam domus contiguae dicto hedificio et ita posse fieri declaraverunt et rogaverunt per me notarium infrascriptum. A.S.F., Bigallo, II, 2, 19r. December 20, 1359 (Poggi, Bigallo, 227; Saalman, The Bigallo, 45, n. 4). The confraternity, or compagnia (company), designates two of its membersAmaretto and Francescoto serve as operai, or overseers of the work about to be completed on the building. These volunteers will be expected to consult with the masons as construction commences and continues, and they will confer with the confraternity to describe the progress made and articulate the challenges that face them. Of note is the language used in this entry: as it serves as an internal document and not as an official legal contract, the vernacular Italian of everyday use has been employed. But when transactions occurwhether they be in the forms of wills, purchases, or gifts (see the donation of property from Giovanni degli Albizzi to the confraternity, noted above in 1351)professional notaries will be called upon to draft the agreement in Latin, the language of the Church and the language of the commune, so that its binding in the eyes of both judicial systems. . Item elexoro e chiamarono, per loro e per la detta compagnia, operai governatori e fabricatori del laborio delloratorio, con balia di potere allogare i lavorio che si dee fare delle volte e dellaltro lavorio che intorno accio bisogna di fare a quelle persone che alloro piacera e per quel tempo e termine e con quel salaro e mercede che alloro piacera, voglendo che il detto mandato duri finito lofitio de detti Amaretto e Francesco capitani insino che il detto lavorio sia finito e compiuto. A.S.F., Bigallo, II, 2, 27r. March 23, 1359 (1360) (Poggi, Bigallo, 227-28; Saalman, The Bigallo, 46, n. 5a). The building is constructed! A carpenter, or tavoliere, named Leonardo Bartolini has overseen an expensive project to decorate the buildingit has cost the confraternity 100 gold florins, a healthy sum in 1360, and has been delivered to the craftsman by Matteo Portinari, a camarlingo who has been designated by the companys members as the official responsible for taking care of business transactions for them. This project seems to postdate an earlier one that had resulted in the carving and installation of a sculptural program in marble of the Virgin Mary and Angels by Alberto Arnoldi that still exists in the Museo del Bigallo. Located on the ground floor and facing out toward the Corso degli Adimari, the image could have been seen by all passersby on the street as they moved to or from the piazza. The date of the document, March 23, indicates that this is a year-end appraisal of work: the Florentines marked the start of each new year on March 25, the feast of the Annunciation of the Virgin (yes, nine months to the day before the Nativity of Christ), which in turn represented to them the beginning of a new era in history. . In prima avuto consideratione alla constructione delloratorio e che bisogna e aconciare luogho dove le figure di marmo di nostra Donna e deglagnoli, le quali si fanno e lavorano, si ponghano, e altre chose bisognia intorno al detto oratorio fare, e voglendo intorno accio provedere, deliberarono e stantiarono che Mattheo Portinari, camarlingho della detta compagnia, dea e paghi a Leonardo Bartolini tavoliere e a compagni fior. 100 doro, i quali il detto Leonardo debbia ispendere nel lavorio del detto oratorio e per quello fare adornare e cresciere. A.S.F., Bigallo, II, 2, 29v. June 5, 1360 (Poggi, Bigallo, 227-28; Saalman, The Bigallo, 46, n. 5b). Leonardo Bartolini continues to oversee work on the building, while Matteo Portinari continues to pay him. A man named Francesco Salvini has joined the crew and is compensated for his work. Item deliberarano estantiavarono che Leonardo Bartolini dea e paghi a Francesco Salvini pro parte di pagamento de lavorio che deono fare aloratorio f. xiii doro fecero labolletta. A.S.F., Bigallo, II, 2, 31r. August 26, 1360 (Poggi, Bigallo, 227-28; Saalman, The Bigallo, 46, n. 5c). In the summer months, stone masons come into the project, again sub contracted by Leonardo Bartolini. They receive a hefty sum of 60 gold florins for their work. Item deliberarono che Leonardo Bartolini de somma a lui depositata dea e paghi a Matteo Portinari Camarlingho della detta compagnia per ispendere dare e paghare a maestri in pietre calcine erea f. LX doro e di cio fecero la bolletta in due partite. A.S.F., Bigallo, II, 2, 37r. June 30, 1361 (Poggi, Bigallo, 228; Saalman, The Bigallo, 46, n. 6). Now that construction on the addition to the building along the Corso degli Adimari has been completed, a man named Bartolomeo paints the roof. Bartolomeo received the equivalent of about 1 1/5 gold florins for his work (as there were roughly 40 lire to the florin): but, as he was a day laborer and had a number of inexpensive items he needed to purchase for his profession, he preferred to take his payment in smaller denominations of silver lire, soldi, and denari Note that Bartolomeos profession is listed as dipintore, the same word used for those who painted figures on altarpieces, frescoes, and manuscript pages. The latter were not yet referred to as artists. . In prima statiarono che il camarlingho paghi a Bartolomeo dipintore l. 62 s. 3 d. 6, i quali dee avere per dipintura del tetto de loratorio. A.S.F., Bigallo, II, 3, 27v. July 5, 1386 (Poggi, Bigallo, 229; Saalman, The Bigallo, 46, n. 7a). Niccolo di Pietro Gerini and Ambrogio di Baldesetwo painters, or dipintorireceive 17 gold florins for completing a fresco on the faade of the original building that then, as now, faced the Baptistery of S. Giovanni The fresco illustrates one of the many charitable duties of the confraternitythe receipt, care, and return of children deposited there by parents either unable or unwilling to care for them. The painting could be seen by anyone and everyone standing at the south portal of the Baptistery (where a portion of the ritual of baptism was performed, with infants, parents, godparents, and friends would participate) or walking past the Bigallo on their way to or from work, social events, or shopping. The two painters worked together on a number of projects, but Gerini in particular became a favorite of Florentine patrons at the end of the fourteenth century. His works adorned altars and interior spaces of the Confraternity of the Pilgrims in S. Maria Novella, the ___ chapel in S. Croce, the guild church of Orsanmichele, and the monastery of S. Maria degli Angeli. Largely overlooked by historians of early Renaissance art, his popularity at the turn of the fifteenth century speaks to the public taste for imagery just before the arrival in Florence of the transformative artist named Masaccio. A Nicholo di Piero e Ambrogio di Baldese dipintori a di 22 di Giugno per resto del lavorio della dipintura della faccia dinanzi della casa della Misericordia, fior. 17 doro. A.S.F., Bigallo, II, 3, 90r. November 21, 1392 (Poggi, Bigallo, 228; Saalman, The Bigallo, 46, n. 7b). Ambrogio di Baldese paints a room in the Misericordiahere referred to as the domus (or home) used by the officers (capitani) of the confraternity. This was probably the so-called Sala dUdienza, or Audience Hall, where decisions large and small were discussed by the companys leaders. The modest sum of 8 lire, 6 soldi delivered to the painter suggests that this payment represented either a small portion of a larger original total agreed upon earlier or, conversely, that the image Ambrogio produced in the Audience Hall was very small and not terribly time consuming. Ambroxio Baldesis pictori pro expensis pro reactando picturam domus misericordiae in qua congregantur capitanei tam pro expensis factis per eum quam pro suo labore in totum l.8, s. 6. 1.

Election of operai for building of the oratory. Item elexoro e chiamarono, per loro e per la detta compagnia, operai governatori e fabricatori del laborio delloratorio, con balia di potere allogare i lavorio che si dee fare delle volte e dellaltro lavorio che intorno accio bisogna di fare a quelle persone che alloro piacera e per quel tempo e termine e con quel salaro e mercede che alloro piacera, voglendo che il detto mandato duri finito lofitio de detti Amaretto e Francesco capitani insino che il detto lavorio sia finito e compiuto.

Oratory construction in 1360. a.  In prima avuto consideratione alla constructione delloratorio e che bisgona e aconciare luogho dove le figure di marmo di nostra Donna e degliagnoli, le quali si fanno e lavorano, si ponghano, e altre chose bisognia intorno al detto oratiorio fare, e voglendo intorno accio provedere, deliberarono e stantiarono che Mattheo Portinari, camarlingho della detta compagnia, dea e paghi Leonardo Bartolini tavoliere e a compagni fior. 100 doro, i quali il detto Leonardo debbia ispendere nel lavorio del detto oratorio e per quello fare adornare e cresciere. a.

Giuseppe Richas description of the Bigallo residence in 1758 E pero consideriamo una pittura grande sopra il Portone al di fuori dipinta a fresco rappresentante in varie, e belle attitudini, dove molti Fanciulli smarriti, e dove delle Madri chi afflitta per la perdita dal figlio, e chi in aria allegra per vederselo restituire da Capitani del Bigallo, veggendosi in tale dipintura molte Case, e Torri alluso di quetempi, cioe del 1444 come travosi notato al liv. x pag. 8 nellArchivio del medesimo Bigallo, dove si legge anche il nome del Pittore e dice, 1444. 1 Iunii Capitanei S. Marie Virginis, &amp;amp; Misericordie del Bigallo &amp;amp;c. ordinano pagarsi diversi obblighi del loro Spedale &amp;amp;c. Item Piero Chellino Pictori pro resto totius sue Picture facte in Domo habitationis Capitaneorum in facie exteriori. Nell andito dellUdienza sonovi alquante Pitture vetuste, come quelle che occupano tutta la parete addirimpetto alla Porta del Magistrato, ma cosi annerite, e guaste, che non e sperabile larrivare ad intenderle: sul piano della scala, che con due braccia conduce al piano superiore, vedesi un Cristo ritto nel Sepolcro, colle braccia aperte, tenente nel senno una moltitudine di gente per esprimere la Misericordia, e sotto due Cartelli di caratteri gottici, che dicono: O volgente..XXI. E a manritta di questa porta viene una parimente antichissima pittura a fresco, ed una Figura gigantesca della Misericordia espressa in una Persona ammantata di Piviale con Mitra tonda in capo, e Stolone fina ai piedi, nella quale Stola veggonsi alcuni ovati, in cui sono effigiate le Opere della Misericordia con lettere longobarde. Questa figura sta in aria in atto maestoso di padrona, sopra a Firenze dipintale sotto con Popolo inginocchioni, e chi bramasse sapere qual fosse il secondo Cerchio della Citta, lo veda quivi delineato. Il Pittore di questa Tavola spiego la sua idea con le seguenti lettere mezze gottiche, ma rifiorite sullantiche, e dichono: OMNIS MISERICORDIA FACIET LOCVM VNICVIQVE SECVNDVM MERITVM OPERVM SVORVM, ET SECVNDVM INTELLECTVM PEREGRINATIONIS ILLIVS ANNO MCCCLII. Uscendo da questra loggetta a man destra sono nel muro numero sei arpioni alti dal piano degli scalini due in tre braccia, de quali sha certa tradizione, che serevissero per attaccarvi la Cattedra, quando San Pier Martire predicava in sue questa Piazza; della qual cosa non avendo altra autenticazione, che il detto di qualche Persona antica, mi bastera di averlo qui accennato, lasciando a ciascuno giudicare come gli piace. E sulla Porta dellUdienza, oltre larme deGranduchi evvi un Cartello contenente a caratteri doro queste lettere; SERENISS. COSMO MAGNO D. HETRURIAE | XII. VIRI CUM CERTIS PIETATIS MINISTERIIS | ET PUERIS DERELICTIS CUM ALIQUA ECCLESIAST. | DIGNI PERSONA COLLGENDIS ET CURANDIS PRAEFECTI. But let us consider a grand picture over the Gate on the outside painted in fresco representing in various, and beautiful attitudes, where many lost children, and where the mothers who were afflicted by the loss of the child, and who in happy air to see them returned from the Captains of the Bigallo, seeing in this painting many Houses, and Towers to the use of those times, that is of 1444 as noted in book X page 8 in the Archive of the same Bigallo, where one reads also the name of the Painter and say, 1444. 1 June Captains of Saint Virgin Mary, &amp;amp; Misericordia del Bigallo [&amp;amp;c.] 22. P. Landinis description of the oratory and residence (first published 1779) with notes by P. Pillori (published 1845) Pp. 16-17: Parimente in detto oratorio ad uso e comodo di sagrestia vi e annessa una stanza di lunghezza braccia otto, e di larghezza braccia sei, che aveva lingresso in un atrio ben grande dell ufizio, che teneva il magistrato de sigg. capitani del Bigallo, prima che fosse quello nellanno 1777 a nuova forma ridotto. Pp. 16-17: Likewise in the said oratory for use and convenience of the sacristy [it?] has a room eight braccia long, and in width six braccia, which had the entrance to a great atrium of the office, which was held by the magistrate of the Lord Capitains of the Bigallo, before that was in the year 1777 in a new, reduced form. Pillori, p. 17 no. 1: I fratelli della compagnia della Misericordia acquistarono da Baldinaccio Adimari nel 1340 alcune case, e da queste, oltre la residenza pe capitani, levarono una stanza per use di sagrestia, che ora piu non esiste. Pillori, p. 17 no. 1: The brothers of the Company of the Misericordia acquired from Baldinaccio Adimari in 1340 some houses, and of these, beside the residence [pe] captains, they raised a room for use of the sacresty, that now no longer exists. P. 17: Presentemente la comunicazione della sopredetta sagrestia, la quale fu comprata da Baldinaccio Adimari, si vede essere remasta in un piccolo andito, vicino ad un principio di scala di sette scalini che introduce a due scale, con branche di ferro, e davanti alla medesima, ben conservato, si vede espresso in una pittura sul legno un Cristo ritto nel sepolcro con le braccia apere che tiene nel seno una moltitudine di gente, per esprimere la Misericordia, e sotto due cartelli di caratteri gotici, che dicono P. 17 Presently the communication of the above mentioned sacristy, which was bought from Baldinaccio Adimari, [seen to be remaining in a small step], near to a [principle] of stairs of seven steps that lead to two stairs, with iron railings, and in front of the same, well-conserved, one sees expressed in a picture on wood a Christ [straight?] in the tomb with open arms that keep to his bosom a multitude of people, to express the Misericordia, and underneath two signs of Gothic characters, that say P. 21: Si vedevano al pubblico esposte sopra il portone al di fuori, che conduceva in detto luogo alcune pitture dipinte a fresco lanno 1444 rappresentanti in varie attitudini alcuni fanciulli smarriti, e fra essi alcune madri afflitte per la perdita dei loro figliuoli, ed altre in aria allegra per vederseli restituire dai capitani; e benche consumate dal tempo vi si vedono alcune case, e torri alluso di quei tempi. Trovasi di tale pittura descritto lautore nellarchivio del commissariato nel lib. X alla pag. 8, ove si legge PRIMO IUNII PETRO CHELLINIO PICTORI PRO RESTO TOTIUS PICTURAE FACTA IN DOMO HABITATIONIS CAPITANORUM IN FACIE EXTERIORI. Ma tutte queste pitture dal presente commissario in occasione della nuova fabbrica, fatta per commissario in occasione della nuova fabbrica, fatta per miglio comodita de poveri abbandonati con somma attenzione e diligenza, e accio non si perdesse del tutto tal memoria, nel mese di settembre dellanno 1777 furono in poco tempo, per mezzo di maestro Teobaldo Bercilli, fatte segare in due pezzi, che trasportati hanno poi servito per chiudere latrio, e farvi una nuova stanza, che prima metteva nellufizio de predetti sigg. capitani; nella quale sono state unite altre pitture e memorie antiche esprimenti molte opere del glorioso S. Pier Martire, ed una figura rappresentante la Misericordia. Nel mese di dicembre di detto anno, dopo che fu ultimata la nuova fabbrica del prenominato sig. commissario fu ordinato che per mano di Santi Pacini fossero ripulite tutte; come pure diciotto quadri di altezza, e larghezza di braccia uno e un sesto, dodici de quali restano dentro la sopradetto stanza, e sei in altro luogo interno, degni di ogni bellezza, per lattenzione usata dal detto professore. P. 21: One saw in the public place above the doorway to the outisde, which [led?] in the said place some pictures painted in fresco in the year 1444 representing in various attitudes some lost children, and between these some mothers afflicted by the loss of their children, and others [in the air?] happy to see them restored by the captains; and although consumed by time you see some houses, and towers in the use of those times. One finds these pictures described by the author in the Archive of the Commissariato in book X page 8, where one reads FIRST OF JUNE PIETRO CELLINI PAINTER FOR ALL THE PICTURES DONE IN THE LIVING QUARTERS OF THE CAPTAIN AND THE EXTERIOR. But all these pictures from the present commissario because of the new work, done for the Pillori, p. 22 n. 1, inscription under Fanciulli Smarriti fragment: FLORENTINI ORPHANOTROPHI MONVMENTVM | EXTERNAE AEDIS HVIVSCE PARIETI | GRAPHICE A VETERIBVS CONSIGNATVM | HAC IN NVPERRIMA EIVSMET RESTAVRATIONE | ARTE TRANSLATVM ANNO MDCCLXXVII | PETRO LEOPOLDO I ARCHID.

Quelle esprimenti alcuni fatti della vita di S. Pier Martire sono molto annerite e guaste, e si scorgono nella parete dirimpetto alla porta, che introduceva un tempo alla residenza del magistrato, sulla quale tuttora si vedono le armi della Misericordia e del Bigallo in un solo scudo ridotte. Pillori p. 22 n. 2: Also all these pictures remain now in the room of the [cashier] of the Bigallo. Those exprerssing some done of the life of Saint Peter Martyr are very blackened and [faulty], and they [notice?] on the wall opposite the gate, which once introduced to the residence of the magistrate, on which still they see the arms of the Misericordia and of the Bigallo in one reduced shield. Pp. 37-39:  una pittura antica esprimente la Misericordia, la quale ora resta in una nuova stanza del commissariato del Bigallo. Questa stanza fu tutta dipinta nel mese di novembre dellanno 1777 da Francesco Panaiotti, ed ora serve per uso del detto sig. commissario fu fatta ripulire da Santi Pacini insieme con gli altri diciotto quadri esistenti in parte nella medesima stanza; di altezza braccia uno e un sesto, esprimenti le piu stupende azioni di S. Pier Martire Pp. 37-39:  an old picture displaying the Misericordia, which now rests in a new room of the [commissariato] of the Bigallo. This room was all painted in the month of November in the year 1777 by Francesco Panaiotti, and now serves for the use of the aforementioned Sig. Commissario was done re-cleaned by Santi Pacini together with the other eighteen paintings Pillori, p. 39 n. 1: Tutte queste pitture molto ben conservate si vedono tuttora nella stanza del cassiere del Bigallo: le dodici esprimenti le azioni di S. Pier Martire sono un poco annerite e guaste Il Becchi nel suo illustratore Fiorentino a ragione si lamento che alla parete ove la pittura esprimente la Misericordia si fosse in addietro fatto attaccare un casotto da impiegati che la danneggiava, e ne impediva la vista. Ma recentemente e stato staccato dal muro quel casotto, e sbassato. Pillori, p. 39 n. 1: All of these well-preserved pictures are seen still in the room of the [cassiere] of the Bigallo: the twelve expressing the actions of Saint Peter Martyr are a little blackened and damaged The 23.
