        "content"  : "Baptistery of S. Giovanni, South Doors (1330-1336) Andrea Pisano The south portal of the Florentine Baptistery of S. Giovanni was originally adorned with a wooden door. In 1322 members of the Arte della Calimala, the Cloth Merchants Guild that was responsible for the building’s maintenance, upkeep, and decorations, moved to cover those doors with metal plates that they felt would act as a sign of the structure’s importance. By 1329 this approach was amended with a plan to make entirely new doors for the portal that would be made wholly of metal or brass. A goldsmith was sent to Pisa to study prototypes there, and by January of 1330 work was initiated on the Baptistery’s south portal. Wax models were completed by April of that year, and in January of 1332 the casting of at least some of the twenty-eight panels began in earnest. The lengthy chasing process lasted from February 1333 until December 1335, and the entire ensemble was installed by June 20, 1336, just in time for the celebration of the Feast of St. John the Baptist, the patron saint of Florence, which was observed four days later. Andrea Pisano, who inscribed his name on one of the panels in 1330 (“ANDREAS UGOLINI NINI DI PISIS ME FECIT A.D. MCCCXXX”), seems to have been involved in this project from the very beginning. A promising sculptor who had trained as a goldsmith – a logical background for one eager to sculpt in metals, like bronze – Andrea had received the commission from the Arte della Calimala due to his earlier successes in Pisa, Siena, and Orvieto, where his work showed a clear adherence to the Gothic style then in vogue north of the Alps. In a way, his selection marked a departure from the Florentine norm, which emphasized a more classicizing approach to sculpture like that seen in the work of Arnolfo di Cambio, the architect and sculptor of the new cathedral of S. Maria del Fiore and the designer of the Franciscan church of S. Croce. The centralized compositions and large, volumetric masses of Arnolfo now gave way to the swaying draperies and elegantly elongated heroes in Andrea’s scenes. Neither the choice of John the Baptist as subject of this relief cycle nor the choice of the south portal as the setting for it comes as a surprise. The south doors faced the larger portion of the city center, and therefore was the ‘front door’ of the Baptistery for most residents approaching the facility. Moreover, the south portal – perhaps because of their location as the ‘front door’ of the building for most locals – was the place where much of the baptismal ritual was performed in the later Middle Ages. It made sense, then, to ornament this particular portal with images of the namesake of the Baptistery and the patron saint of the city, for this was the entrance seen and used by the greatest number of people in 1322 and beyond. Andrea’s design incorporates a number of geometric patterns and shapes into its overall design. As Anita Moskowitz has noted, the rectangular doors situated inside the large portal that penetrates the octagonal Baptistery serve to frame smaller hexagons, quatrefoils, and rhomboids that contain the scenes and figures within them. Within these framing devices appear twenty narrative scenes, beginning with the Annunciation to Zacharias(image) (John’s elderly father) and ending with the Burial of the Baptist(image), who was beheaded by King Herod at roughly the same time as the Crucifixion of Christ. At the doors’ base appear two rows of seated allegorical characters: the first shows each of the three Theological virtues (images) (Hope, Faith, and Charity) with an additional relief of Humility added for good measure, and, below it, a row depicting each of the four Cardinal virtues (images) (Fortitude, Temperance, Justice, and Prudence). The mixing of religious symbols with civic ones underscores the dual nature of John’s importance for the Florentines, who revered the saint both for his status as patron saint of the commune and for his role as the baptizer of Christ and his followers in the Bible. Throughout the ensemble, Andrea Pisano engages with the difficult parameters of the quatrefoil framing devices that enfold his compositions. Popular in French manuscript painting and stained glass designs from the thirteenth century, these lobed configurations do not always lend themselves easily to three-dimensional forms. At times, Andrea refrains from using the rounded corners of his frame at all, choosing instead to leave empty those areas that form the upper and lower boundaries: The Birth of the Baptist(image), for example, contains literally nothing inside the ultimately vacant upper registers of the composition. At other times, Andrea seems to work too hard to fill those zones, as he does with the seemingly gratuitous trees that pop up inexplicably on either side of the wilderness into which the youthful Baptist (image) strides. Still, his mastery of the complicated and temperamental medium of bronze casting shines through in each of these panels, as their pristine condition even today speaks of their high quality of craftsmanship. Andrea, while certainly inventive and highly creative in his approach to these scenes, had an obvious template in mind when he devised his twenty scenes of the life of John the Baptist. The monumental mosaic covering the Baptistery’s ceiling, probably installed between 1275 and 1310 (at the very latest), includes in one of its horizontal bands the story of Florence’s patron saint, with many of the same scenes that later appear in the south door’s relief panels. Both cycles include multiple scenes that take place at or outside the prison in Jerusalem in which the Baptist was held, and both sequences may well refer to the local custom whereby non-violent prisoners in Florentine jails were released annually on June 24 – the Feast Day of St. John the Baptist. Although large effigies by Arnolfo di Cambio and Tina da Camaino were already installed on the cathedral’s façade by 1336, Andrea Pisano’s bronze reliefs were for almost one hundred years among the most highly prized images in the entire city.

        "content"  : "The Abandonment and Restitution of Children The Misericordia operated a kind of Foster Care unit inside its walls, and supported destitute families by tending to infants born into unstable environments. The hope was that these children would ultimately be reunited with their parents once affairs could be righted in the home, and sometimes this actually occurred. Often times it did not. The fresco on the building’s façade presents a moralizing image about the circumstances parents might find themselves in when seeking the Misericordia’s services and the custodial care offered by confraternity members. Led by a woman in white, a number of children appear in the lower left, holding opened pomegranates and moving toward the composition’s center. A black-clad woman, an ominous reference to the sorrowful situation unfolding before her, points her finger into a circle formed by three others, one of whom holds a child in her arms. Another woman turns her back to us, revealing only the braided and unveiled hair than stretches down her back; perhaps signifying her as an unmarried and youthful woman. Her facelessness may be the artists’ way of providing anonymity to a sinful woman who now faces the consequences of her sexual transgressions, a way of acknowledging the presence of unwed mothers in Florentine society without actually identifying any one of them in particular. The Misericordia’s loggia features prominently at the painting’s core as both the primary setting and, to a degree, the actual hero of this story. The child entering the facility from the left does so only under duress, and resists the confraternity member who forcibly grabs his arm to yank him inside. The frown on the man’s face reveals and accentuates the real-life dramas that transpire at the Misericordia on a regular basis, as well as the emotional toll endured by all parties during these familial severances. This dramatic anecdote is framed by the loggia of the residence hall, which seems to act as a participant in the action that unfolds within its arches. Fortunately, the right side of the fresco tells a happier story. Now a trio of men – one of whom literally pushes a child out of the loggia – oversees the restitution of children with their elated parents. Women congregate before the doorway to the residence hall, which has been identified by Arnoldi’s half-length sculpture, installed in 1361, of the Madonna holding her own child (find the Madonna and Child). Whereas the left side features only women in the act of abandonment, the right side includes men, as well: we might wish to see them as fathers, but there is no way to confirm such an identification (they could be grandfathers, uncles, friends, or merely bystanders who witness this reunification). To the far left stands a woman in blue who acts as the counterweight to the one in black on the left side: she seems to serve as an allegory of the joy of familial reconciliation, as opposed to her scolding counterpart’s representation of the pains associated with abandonment. The fresco’s placement on the building’s façade – just above the setting that Gerini and Ambrogio di Baldese represented in this image, in fact – made it immediately visible to all passersby who walked along or stood at the south edge of the Baptistery of S. Giovanni. Chief among these viewers would have been the parents and family members of infants who witnessed the portion of the baptismal ceremony that was performed in front of S. Giovanni’s south portal. As such, the image probably had an immediate impact on new parents and their families: the Misericordia, it seemed to say, could help them in times of need, but that there would be emotional strains involved should they choose to render their children to the confraternity’s care. It was, at one and the same time, both a somber warning and a gesture of great charity. Niccolò di Pietro Gerini and Ambrogio di Baldese used the architectural structure of the Misericordia as a character in this fictitious narrative, but they also employed other features of the urban environment as markers for viewers of the fresco who stood below it in the middle of the square. The viewer has been intentionally positioned to see this fresco with her or his back to the baptistery, which of course explains why that octagonal form does not appear in the painting. To the far left appears the façade of the new cathedral, finally walled up in 1381 and ready to be capped with a dome that had not yet been designed. The square building next to it seems to represent the city’s bell tower, articulated in pink with standing sculptures placed on top of it to recall the statues on the Campanile. A cluster of structures follows, perhaps representing the Palazzo del Podestà, the square granary of Orsanmichele (complete with niches containing sculptures, which would have been an accurate sight in 1386), the crenelated residence of the Wool Guild, and a spiral column in front of it that may allude to the base of a pedestal that was positioned at the mouth of the Old Market. To the right of the loggia appears a regal palazzo, complete with two towers, that may mark it as the old Bishop’s palace. Alternatively, this pink structure might echo the form of S. Maria Maggiore, the church located to the west of the loggia. The artists have elongated this urban landscape and altered its features in an effort to plot out a pathway for viewers that they would understand. The city has been depicted not as a rational space, with vistas and dimensions and distances carefully mapped out, but rather as a series of independent landmarks easily identified by specific features that have no real relationship to the structures beside them. As Sonia Brozak notes, this conforms to the common approach that Trecento writers took when describing spaces in written texts. Dante and Boccaccio tended to take for granted their readers’ familiarity with urban environments and, when describing the settings of their tales, preferred to focus on specific landmarks in real places rather than review the vast cityscape in which those landmarks were located. The two painters worked together on a number of projects, but Gerini in particular became a favorite of Florentine patrons at the turn of the fifteenth century. His works adorned altars and interior spaces of the Confraternity of the Pilgrims in S. Maria Novella, the sacristy in the Franciscan church of S. Croce, the guild church of Orsanmichele, and the Camaldolese monastery of S. Maria degli Angeli. He also worked in the towns surrounding Florence in rural Tuscany, a testament to the extent of his reputation. Largely overlooked by historians of early Renaissance art, Gerini’s popularity speaks to the public taste for Giottesque imagery just before the arrival in Florence of the transformative New Style of painting articulated in full by the artist named Masaccio (d. ca. 1427).

        "content"  : "Nardo di Cione, Last Judgment, ca. 1363 The wall just within the confines of the Bigallo’s loggia contains a now-damaged and detached fresco that probably illustrated the theme of the Last Judgment that artists like Nardo di Cione found so appealing during the fourteenth century (figure 1). The painting faced out toward the public from the chamber just inside the entrance, positioned on its west wall and facing east toward the Campanile that Andrea Pisano had recently ornamented with dozens of marble reliefs. The composition features the figure of Christ, who blesses viewers from his perch on a celestial cloudbank while holding in his left hand the open book emblazoned with the Alpha and Omega (the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, symbolic of the notion that Christ is the beginning and the ending of all things). Two pairs of angels flank him, some genuflecting with musical instruments in their hands and the others crossing their arms over their chests while gazing at their performing mates (figure 2). A constellation of gold stars covers what remains of the blue field below, damaged when the sculptural ensemble produced by Alberto Arnoldi was removed and relocated elsewhere in the Bigallo. Circumstantial evidence points toward Nardo as the artist responsible for the Last Judgment. Documents tell us that Nardo was paid to paint the ceiling vaults of the Bigallo in October, 1363 and that, at the time of his death two years later, he bequeathed to the institution a portion of his estate. Although neither archival reference pertains specifically to the wall on which the Last Judgment appears, scholars agree that Nardo was probably the author of the painting, and that the picture was most likely produced sometime in the early 1360s, at roughly the same time as Arnoldi’s Madonna and Child was sculpted for and installed in the loggia. The damage to this fresco obviously impedes our understanding and interpretation of it within the context of the Bigallo’s development as a charitable, social, and political institution. Certainly its subject matter made clear the spiritual qualities to which the Company of the Misericordia aspired, while the rather fierce representation of the uncompromising Christ figure must have injected into this setting – and projected onto the street where passersby could see it – a severe reminder of the fleetingness of time and the certainty of judgment at the End of Days. For precisely these reasons the Last Judgment was the perfect image for a confraternity eager to coax new members (and deep-pocketed donors) into its midst, for this reminder of the importance the Christian faith placed on works of charity was more than a subtle hint that this was a place worth supporting.

        "content"  : "In 1321, a wealthy magnate named Baldinaccio Adimari gifted property that he owned in his family’s neighborhood to a newly formed charitable organization charged with the tasks of tending to the destitute, diseased, and disenfranchised. The building there housed the Misericordia from that time forward but, thanks to a series of additional gifts from neighbors, the company was able to expand its residence to the east and the west. Giovanni degli Albizzi Pellegrini, a member of one of the city’s most powerful families, donated property adjacent to the original building in 1351, and in 1355 the addition of the twenty feet at the corner of the Corso Adimari provided the company with the area needed for the loggia that now extended to the east. From 1355 to 1360, a man named Leonardo Bartolini oversaw the construction of this loggia, which included work completed by a number of skilled laborers he subcontracted to produce details according to their areas of expertise: One Francesco Salvini received 13 gold florins for undisclosed work, while a painter named Bartolommeo earned the equivalent of 21 gold florins for his decoration of the top of the oratory – presumably its ceiling, but perhaps the walls of the upper floor of the residence. In 1363 the project was deemed complete when the so-called Ambrogio installed elaborate decorative ironwork, priced at 100 florins (but no more than that!), on the loggia’s western and northern arches. Although more modest in scale than some of Florence’s other loggias, the intimate proportions and delicate decorations of this elegant monument make the Misericordia’s structure one of the most beautiful in the city. Ambrogio’s iron grill alone distinguishes it from other such edifices in Florence, but it’s easy to overlook it when taking in the entirety of the building for the first time. The marble exterior forms two sides of the loggia’s square box, with openings on the east and north sides providing visual access to the interior. Green marble, a decorative motif borrowed from the eleventh-century facings of the Baptistery and S. Miniato, provides a subtle articulation that frames the two arches, their pendentives, and the horizontal borders at the top and bottom. Column clusters form the discrete sections of each pier and serve as supports for the loggia’s arches, and then spring upward toward the quadripartite vault that flowers into porch’s ceiling. Twisting columns, perhaps allusions to the spiral ones said to have once adorned the interior of King Solomon’s temple in Jerusalem, create the illusion of movement as one’s eye moves toward the interior. Foliage and rosette patterns dance across the surface of the entire white marble structure, making the loggia appear as an avant-garde welcoming center to all comers. This sense is only intensified by the figurative sculptures that decorate the façade. Within the green strips that create sections across the loggia’s surface appear a series of modest bas-reliefs – perhaps carved by Arnolfo Arnoldi, under the influence of Andrea Pisano – that contain in them a set of undifferentiated heavenly figures who tilt their heads back to consider images of Christ at the apex of each arch. The quatrefoil frames on the east arch contain scroll-bearing prophets from the Old Testament who flank the half-length form of the Dead Christ – the so-called Man of Sorrows – while those on the north arch feature saints from the New Testament and the Early Christian church who receive a blessing from an image of the Resurrected Christ above them. Representatives from both books of the Bible here recognize Jesus as Savior. Triangular spandrels on either side of each arch contain half-length figures of the four Cardinal Virtues: Temperance and Prudence appear above the rounded vault on loggia’s the east side, while Justice and Fortitude decorate that on the north. These same characters appear in Nardo di Cione’s lunette fresco of The Judgment of Brutus from the middle of the 1340s that decorated the main room of the Florentine Wool Guild, just down the street, on the way to the Ponte Vecchio. The concepts that guide wise decisions and just behaviors in and in front of the Misericordia have been paired with Judeo-Christian heroes whose exemplary lives and influential texts combine to form the experiential and codified bases for fourteenth-century moral codes. The very form of the public loggia carried some symbolic importance in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Often installed for pragmatic purposes – namely to provide the public with a form of protection from soaking rains or the intense Italian sun – the loggia came to be understood as a civic structure that, even when built by private citizens, was a gift to the commune at large. For example, the Loggia dei Lenzi, situated adjacent to the Palazzo della Signoria, gave the governmental piazza an architectonic emblem of democracy, as its form, location, and function suggested an accessibility to literally anyone who wished to venture inside it. Giovanni Rucellai’s loggia, placed opposite his palace in the middle of the fifteenth century on the occasion of his son’s marriage to Cosimo de’Medici’s daughter, heightened the owner’s sense of self-importance as he simultaneously celebrated his prominence in the city as a Medici kinsman and his role as a public servant through this “donation” of an architectural structure to the residents of Florence. In keeping with this signification, the loggia for the Misericordia was both a symbol of the charitable nature of the institution – both the building and the services rendered inside it were gifts to the city – and a symbol of the company’s prominence in the urban environment – it was made of expensive materials, followed long-standing Florentine design traditions, and sat on prime real estate in one of the city’s most important squares. Early painters of Florentine cityscapes occasionally included representations of the loggia when producing vistas of the Piazza S. Giovanni, although their renditions differed from artist to artist and from painting to painting. The building features prominently in the fresco by Niccolò di Pietro Gerini and Ambrogio di Baldese that originally decorated the façade of the residence hall that faced the Baptistery, and portrayed its appearance with impressive accuracy. These artists included in their painting of 1386 the column clusters, iron grates, spandrel figures, and the rosette decoration that forms the left side of the loggia’s entrance that mark it as such a remarkable space, suggesting that the building’s details truly mattered to both the fresco’s painters and its audience. Ridolfo Ghirlandaio, by contrast, painted in 1515 a much more simplified version of the space in his predella for the Bigallo altarpiece (with figures by Alberto Arnoldi installed in 1364): the sixteenth-century artist emphasized rectilinear pilasters (rather than sculpted column clusters and spiral colonnettes) as supports for the arches, avoided the articulation of each bas-relief, and omitted the figures of the Cardinal Virtues that were sculpted in the spandrels. Even though he truncated the residence in his painting – he shows only two arched bays on the north façade instead of three – he was careful to include iron bars within the archway and the rosette plinth at its base. The late sixteenth-century aerial view of Piazza S. Giovanni by either Giorgio Vasari or the Flemish painter Jan van der Straet (a.k.a. Giovanni Stradano, a.k.a. Johannes Stradanus, d. 1605) references the loggia only through the pictorial employment of rounded arches that mark the facility as distinct from those around it, but then fails entirely to capture even a semblance of its actual appearance beyond these obvious rounded vaults. Fabio Borbottoni (d. 1902) reproduced the loggia’s architectural features with some accuracy when he painted his version in the late nineteenth century, but he omitted completely the sculptural elements embedded in the archways: it’s as though they were never installed on the building’s façade at all.

        "content"  : "Madonna and Child with Angels Representations and effigies of all shapes, sizes, and media could adorn the early modern altarpiece, a devotional object that was placed on top of the table where the sacraments of the Eucharist were venerated and consumed by priests. Usually the altarpiece took the form of a wooden painting that featured, up to about 1440 or so, separate panels dedicated to single figures or scenes. The central panel often, but not always, represented the Virgin and Child, while flanking panels celebrated an institution’s reverence for specific saints who might represent the patron of a religious order, parish, feast day, or individual benefactor. Above and below these large forms often appeared smaller pictures dedicated to narrative scenes, often representing moments from the life or lives of those saints occupying the larger panels above. Arnoldi’s ensemble is that rare structure that both embraces and defies tradition. The three-dimensional forms have been arranged in a way that recalls the format of a painted altarpiece, with the central characters of Christ and the Madonna appropriately elevated above those who flank them. But Arnoldi, abiding by the requirements of his contract, sculpted two angels instead of saints to flank the Virgin, a distinct departure from the appearance of most Trecento altarpieces. Moreover, Arnoldi did not carve any bas-relief narrative scenes below these large statues in a way the might mimic a strip of predella panels placed at the base of an altarpiece. (this would be remedied only in the sixteenth century by Ridolfo Ghirlandaio, who painted images of charitable scenes from the Bible that were added to Arnoldi’s altarpiece in 1515). As a result, the ensemble originally appeared as a group of standing figures perched on a platform above the altarpiece in a grouping not unlike the one devised by Giovanni Pisano for the Scrovegni Chapel in the distant city of Padua in 1305. This may explain why, in the records of deliberations concerning Arnoldi’s commission, the captains of the Misericordia mentioned the sculptors of Pisa as the qualitative bar by which the local artist’s works would be judged. Arnoldi’s figures bear close resemblance to sculpted images produced in Florence during the first half of the fourteenth century. Despite being hidden by draperies that pull across her torso and sweep from left hip to right foot, Mary’s body seems proportionally accurate and naturalistically balanced thanks to a contrapposto pose formed by her flexed right knee and straight, weight-bearing left leg. The hefty Christ child, perched on his mother’s bent left arm, raises his right hand to her neck in a gesture of intimacy that contrasts with the more didactic presentation of the small crucifix that he holds in his left. The two angels hold candelabra that appear as columns and turn their heads (attenuated on top of rather slender and elongated necks) inward toward the holy couple. The chubby cheeks of Christ and the volumetric bodies of all four figures suggests the influence of Arnolfo di Cambio, whose marble figures on the façade of the nearby Duomo had been in place since the first decade of the century. But the craned necks and heads of the angels, combined with the swaying hips of the Virgin, recall the more Gothicized work of Giovanni and Andrea Pisano, the latter of whom was active in Florence during the decade of the 1330s. In fact, these visual recollections of the work of earlier Pisan artists confused later critics of Italian sculpture. In his famous sixteenth-century study of Italian art and architecture (the famous Lives of the Artists), Giorgio Vasari erroneously attributed Arnoldi’s figures to Andrea Pisano and his assistant, Ciognara, perhaps due to their participation in the sculptural project to cast bronze reliefs on the south doors of the Baptistery that face the Misericordia’s residence from the middle of the piazza. His mistake is understandable due precisely to Arnoldi’s intentional employment of the Gothicized approach to sculpture that his patrons, the captains of the Misericordia, demanded from him.

All of these figures must be by the hand of Alberto, who shall receive a salary of 150 florins for the figure of our Lady and 130 florins for the two angels, who should be holding candles in their hands: the figure of Mary should be of a higher quality than the figure of Our Lady in Pisa. Its quality will be judged by three or four masters deemed to be qualified by the city of Florence, which shall appoint them at the time. And if it is deemed to be inferior to the one in Pisa, the Bigallo will not be obligated to keep it. And the images of the marble angels must be of the same quality and beauty of the said figure of Mary. He will be paid in the following manner: he will recieve an initial payment of one hundred gold florins, and when the figure of Our Lady has been completed to our satisfaction he will have fifty gold florins, and when he has purchased the marble for the angels he will receive fifty gold florins to cover the cost of materials; he will compose and install in the oratory the figures at his own expense. And the figures will be completed in two years from the time of their initiation, as indicated by the date of the first payment of one hundred florins. See the statement notarized by Ser Tino (aforementioned book, carte 12). 1364, 16 August. They met and absolved the master Alberto Arnoldi and his son, Alesso, of wrongdoing in the production of the figures of Our Lady and angels, and they declared him to be in accord with the agreement made, and they asked me to check the contract and all the agreements, which I annulled and canceled (see carte 57).”",

        "content"  : "Madonna and Child Arnoldi’s Madonna and Child conforms to the half-length form popular at the time. The Virgin’s swung hip supports the Christ child in her left arm, while her right hand clutches both her own breast and the boy’s fingers. The two figures incline their heads toward one another while their halos intersect and overlap. A series of parallel forms – Mary’s right forearm and Christ’s legs, Jesus’s back and the Madonna’s right bicep, Mary’s left hand and her son’s tilted head – leads our eye in a gothic zigzag across the surface that culminates at the composition’s apex where the two heads nearly touch. The glazed background and pointed arch suggest that these figures reside in a celestial zone both above and within the Piazza S. Giovanni: they occupy the heavenly realm in perpetuity but simultaneously preside over the citizens of Florence while protecting the institution of the Misericordia (including both its members and those who take advantage of its services) at all times. Installed above the heads of visitors to the residence hall and positioned in the doorway that led directly to the oratory where Arnoldi’s figures on the Misericordia’s altarpiece stood, the Madonna and Child prepared lay Florentines for the experience they were about to have inside the place where mothers and their children were either separated from each other or reunited after a period of estrangement. The appearance of the Holy Family at this important, limnal juncture between the public space of the city (in the form of the piazza) and the private space of the Misericordia surely offered to viewers of all genders, ages, and vocations a sense of the services rendered by the company as well as the quality of care its members promised to provide for the children offered to it by families in need. As such, the intimacy between Arnoldi’s figures seems both tender and anguished, for some of those who entered into the residence hall from this portal could not have been happy about the transaction that was about to occur. Images of Mary were predictably popular in domestic settings, where women of all ages and stations recognized her as a symbol of matronly love. Her placement above the front entrance of the city’s best-known Foster Care center must have made her particularly appealing to those Tuscan women who, when approaching the confraternity in their time of need, may have been reminded that the Virgin had given birth out of wedlock and probably well before her twentieth birthday. She was a sympathetic and completely appropriate patron for the confraternity of the Misericordia.

        "content"  : "Nardo di Cione (?), The Judgment of Brutus, ca. 1345 Dante Society (ex-Palazzo del Arte della Lana, Sala d’Udienza) The lunette fresco of The Judgment of Brutus has received practically no serious attention from students of Florentine art and history, yet it is one of the more interesting pictures of the mid-fourteenth century (figure 1). Produced for the Sala d’Udienza, or Audience Hall, of the headquarters for the Arte della Lana probably sometime in the middle of the 1340s, the allegorical painting was originally adorned with a series of inscriptions on scrolls that made clear the identities of each figure. We know that the central character, seated on a bench, represents the First Consul of Rome, Junius Brutus, famous for his wisdom and staunch defense of Republicanism in the face of tyranny. Not to be confused with his more infamous descendent (the assassin of Julius Caesar), Junius Brutus led the uprising in 709 BCE that resulted in the dismantling of Rome’s decadent monarchy and the creation of a Republican government that fourteenth-century Florentines took as the predecessor of their own. It comes as no surprise, then, that the painting’s composition, attributed recently to Nardo di Cione, follows closely the groundbreaking template produced by Ambrogio Lorenzetti for his equally political picture, the Allegory of Good Government, completed in 1338 for the Room of the Nine inside Siena’s Palazzo Pubblico. In the Wool Guild’s painting, the four Cardinal Virtues of Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, and Temperance – all of them depicted as women, as was the custom – flank the seated judge, forming a kind of buffer so that the two pairs of finely dressed male petitioners cannot get too close to him. The men spit bitter accusations and threats at the Virtues and, through them, at Junius Brutus: they have axes to grind and wish to make clear that the wisdom of Brutus is not to their liking. The Virtues, by contrast, defend Brutus’ actions and dare the petitioners to follow through on their threats. They will not be cowed by the aggressions of self-important, but ultimately petty, complainants. To the lower right, however, we see a different exchange, and one that seems to catch the eye of Junius Brutus (who looks down in that direction). There we see Temperance engage with a seemingly deferential man, who actually pulls away from the Virtue: she urges him to approach the judge and guarantees that he will receive a fair hearing as long as he shows some respect. The man, in turn, humbly acknowledges his own shortcomings and worries that he is not worthy of Brutus’ attentions – when, in fact, he clearly is the ONLY one among the group of four men who merits a hearing. The painting’s message seems clear to any member of the Wool Guild who might have gazed upon it while waiting his or her turn to file a grievance or receive judgment from its consuls. The rule of law, it says, must be acknowledged; judges must be respected; and all those who appear before it with the proper attitude will be welcomed before the court. But, of course, it also illustrates clearly that those who oppose that court and its commitment to objective jurisprudence will be met with the wrath of its administrators. The timing of the fresco’s production, arguably initiated and completed during the middle years of the 1340s, corresponds to a major crisis that threatened the status quo of the Florence Republic. In the spring of 1343, Walter of Brienne, the Duke of Athens, permitted wool-workers normally excluded from the Arte della Lana to form their own guild, which in turn threatened the economic potency of the Wool Guild and the stability of a city that had traditionally relegated laborers to positions of inferiority with respect to their mercantile superiors. Walter’s ouster that summer was directly connected to this move, demonstrating both the depth of the Wool Guild’s concern over this matter and the power it wielded across the city. When the Duke of Athens fled into exile in August, 1343, the woolworkers’ trade association that he had supported was quickly dismantled and its members were either folded back into the Wool Guild in subordinate roles or were disenfranchised altogether. However, simmering animosities lingered. Some of these now-disenfranchised laborers wished to revive the guild that had been demolished by the wool merchants, and cells of malcontents were formed in 1344 to plot some kind of revival of the corporation that had been taken from them. These movements, when discovered, were suppressed quickly and mercilessly: ringleaders were arrested on charges of treason and sedition, tried within 72 hours, and hanged shortly thereafter. It is in the context of these bitter arguments that the Judgment of Brutus must be considered, for the will of the guild – expressed through the positioning of the Roman judge and his virtuous guardians – is here celebrated as omnipotent, merciful, and benevolent: precisely the things that many of those on the outside believed it wasn’t. In a very real sense, then, the Judgment of Brutus is a picture of pure political and economic propaganda. It attempted both to teach and to control viewers who saw it during times of controversy in the Audience Hall of the Arte della Lana, but did so by promoting itself in ways that, in part, defied credulity.

        "content"  : "Magdalene Chapel Frescoes Built between 1316 and 1322, the Magdalene Chapel served as a holding space in the Bargello Palace, where those convicted of serious crimes received their last rites and awaited execution. Also referred to as the Cappella del Podestà, the chapel is located in the northeast corner of the first floor of the ancient civic building. The walls of the chapel were decorated with vibrant frescoes of the Afterlife, discovered under a coat of whitewash in 1840 and immediately attributed to the hand of Giotto after a controversial restoration project added touch-ups to confirm such an attribution. Painted sometime between 1322 and 1337, the cycle features the remnants of what must have been a vivid scene of Hell on the entrance wall and an image of Christ Enthroned in the Celestial Court on the altar wall opposite it. Lateral walls linking the two contain scenes from the lives of John the Baptist and Mary Magdalene, respectively. One striking feature within the chapel is the apparent absence of a Last Judgment scene, despite the dual representations of Heaven and Hell on opposite sides of the room. This absence may have been due to the chapel’s function as a penal site and the intended viewership of this cycle. Condemned criminals spent their final hours in the chapel after receiving their sentence from a court tribunal, and during their final moments on Earth were invited to decide which fate to embrace for the duration of eternity. To assist them in this process, members of the Arch-confraternity of Santa Maria della Croce al Tempio joined them in the chapel and attended to their spiritual and physical needs as they accepted their confessions. Surely, some conversations about the penance of the Magdalene and the Baptist’s decapitation must have occurred while gazing up at the frescoes that illustrated the lives and deaths of those canonized Christian heroes. The lay brothers then assisted the condemned during the procession through Florentine streets to the gallows beyond the church of S. Croce, offering words of solace and invitations for repentance along the way as the executioner awaited their arrival. The iconography of the Magdalene Chapel was inspired by the function of the space. Having been judged by the commune, the condemned entered the chapel to receive his (or, occasionally, her) last rites and contemplate the fate of their souls, with the options of Heaven and Hell displayed upon the walls. A portrait once believed to be of the famous Italian poet Dante can be seen standing among the figures of Heaven. The North wall of the chapel retains only two of the original scenes from the life of John the Baptist, The Naming of the Baptist and The Feast of Herod. If the cycle was based on the mosaic in the south end of the Baptistery’s ceiling, it may have included an image of John’s imprisonment or his beheading, or both. As the patron saint of Florence, his presence in the Magdalene chapel marked the civic space as a zone protected by its holy advocate, but also reminded the condemned that the Baptist, too, had been executed for his crime. Mary Magdalene’s life cycle, covering the South wall of the chapel and extending to the North wall, also referred to the themes of vice, penance, and redemption, albeit in a much less violent way than seen in the cycle of the Baptist. As the patron saint of sinners, the cycle of her repentance and subsequent salvation set an example upon the walls of the chapel for every sinner who entered the chapel for their last rites.

        "content"  : "Andrea di Cione and Jacopo di Cione, St. Matthew, 1369 Uffizi Galleries (ex-Orsanmichele, south pier) The guilds of Florence agreed in 1336 to place effigies of their patron saints inside and outside the centrally located edifice of Orsanmichele, the grain distribution center that became a church in the middle of the fourteenth century. Only a few of them actually did so, and one of those was the Bankers guild, or Arte del Cambio. In 1367 the elderly painter Andrea di Cione, called Orcagna, received the commission to produce a painting of St. Matthew with four narrative panels flanking the central figure of the standing evangelist (see figure 1). Orcagna ingeniously altered the typical triptych format commonly used by artists when producing devotional pictures so that the side panels folded backwards, rather than forwards over the central compartment, to allow it to fit around the contours of a pier that supported one of the open loggias on the south wall of the building. But Orcagna would not live long enough to see the project through to completion, and his much younger brother, Jacopo, was called upon to finish the job when Orcagna died in 1368. Exactly who painted what has remained an open question, as the features of the figures in all five zones retain a certain consistency of form. Matthew stands in a typically Orcagnesque frontal pose, with a stylus in his right hand and an open book in his left (see figure 2). The figure’s furrowed brow, high cheekbones, and finely painted hair (and whiskers!) recall the stern Christ figure in Andrea’s Strozzi Altarpiece for the church of S. Maria Novella from 1357. The pink robe that surrounds Matthew’s blue garment fits loosely around his torso and arms, and then falls in diagonal folds from the upper left to the lower right, another feature common in Andrea’s oeuvre. But there’s a kind of dullness about the figure that does not correspond precisely to an autograph work by Orcagna, and that gives specialists a certain pause when evaluating the painting. A compelling interpretation is that Orcagna designed the image and got as far as roughly out the compositions, but that Jacopo then took up the project upon his brother’s death in 1368 and did the actual painting of the triptych. Similarly, the four flanking narrative panels, each one dedicated to an important scene from the life of St. Matthew, reveal a painterly approach consistent with works by Orcagna, but an execution that seems less favorable by comparison (see figures 3 and 4). The facial figures of the bearded characters, particularly the areas between the nose and the end of the beard, slope outward at an angle inconsistent with the work of Orcagna but well within the norm for later paintings known to have been produced by Jacopo. These scenes were probably painted by the younger artist and then submitted to the Guild of the Doctors and Apothecaries as evidence of his skill when he applied for admittance to that body in 1369. Oddly, the story reads from the lower left to the upper left, and then moves across the central compartment to the upper right before dropping down to lower right. In the first scene, Christ Calling St. Matthew, we see Jesus beckoning to Matthew, a money-changer who thus complicit with the Romans in their control of Palestine, who in turn accepts the invitation to follow. Behind Matthew we see a bench with a boy guarding a safebox, all references to contemporary practices of customer service in fourteenth-century Florence. The event illustrated here shows us the life of wealth and ease Matthew chose to surrender when he accepted Christ’s call of discipleship. The scene above bears the image of Matthew Quelling Dragons, a fairly typical allegorical description of a saint’s ability to quiet the fury of sin or the presence of evil. Matthew and John the Evangelist (clean-shaven and youthful as always), armed with the truth of the books they hold in their arms, calm the threatening beasts while their masters remark upon the sudden impotence of their usually impressive weapons. The Gospels here defeat heresy not with power or might, but rather with the truth of the word. The upper right panel depicts Matthew, joined again by the beardless John, reviving a dead boy, who sits upright on his funeral bier. To the left we see the infidel marvel at the active power of God’s word: they tilt their heads toward each other, gesture toward the resurrected child, and lift their hands in the air in surprise and dismay. Just as the upper scene across from it on the left side features the quieting of a pair of heretics, so too does this vignette emphasize the defeat of the enemies of Orthodoxy by the righteousness of One True Way. In the final panel we see the martyrdom of Matthew, as the saint falls victim to an assassin’s blade while kneeling before an altar that has been partnered intentionally with the banker’s bench of his previous life’s work on the opposite side of the triptych. As with the pairing of scenes above, we again see our artists intentionally pairing up themes to emphasize a particular message: in this case, we encounter a protagonist’s spiritual development over a period of time. Matthew, who was once a money-changer working from a secular table in a bank, became a follower of Christ and was killed in front of a spiritual table in a church. The connection works well and shows this fundamentally important member of the banking trade as an honorable and godly man. One assumes the members of the Florentine Bankers Guild wished to be seen in the same light. All the same, one cannot overlook the rather strange underlying message that these scenes present. Although Matthew was a banker, and although the Bankers Guild commissioned the work (which has been made clear by the addition of four roundels of gold coins on a red field that have been placed on either side of each flanking panel’s gable), the actual profession of money-changing does not necessarily come off in a good light. Indeed, we are informed that Matthew attains the Kingdom of Heaven in spite of his secular profession rather than because of it, and the Cione brothers seem to encourage members of the Florentine Arte del Cambio to turn their backs on such financial endeavors in order to focus on spiritual ones. Such is the dual and sometimes contradictory nature of religious painting in an early capitalistic society in which its most successful practitioners that worried constantly and openly about the implications of making too much money during one’s earthly existence. It troubled them greatly every time they heard a preacher remind them that it was easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it was for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of Heaven. When, in 1369, the painting was finally installed in Orsanmichele, Jacopo di Cione submitted his portion of the painting to the Arte dei Medici e Speziali as a presentation piece by which his skills could be evaluated in anticipation of entry into the guild. At that time the picture faced the nearby tabernacle that Orcagna had completed only ten years earlier, as well as Bernardo Daddi’s miracle-working dossal of the Madonna del Orsanmichele inside it (figure 5). In a way, the single panel of Matthew and the narrative images next to it formed a sort of detached polyptych when see in tandem with the Madonna and the other pier panels and frescoes the surrounded it. Along with Giovanni del Biondo’s St. John the Evangelist (figure 6) and a number of other panel paintings of patron saints just like it, the image of St. Matthew injected a sense of pictorial elegance and gold-encrusted spirituality to the new church of Orsanmichele that now stood in place of the former grain distribution center of Florence.

        "content"  : "Andrea di Cione, Baldacchino, 1352-59 Orsanmichele Framing magnificently the famed miracle-working Madonna of Orsanmichele by Bernardo Daddi, Andrea di Cione’s Baldacchino articulated perfectly the mid-Trecento aesthetic that appealed to Florentine audiences of the day. A massive structure, carved in marble with sections of inlaid gold and mosaic tesserae sprinkled throughout, the tabernacle both framed the picture that, in 1365, was named the “official painting of Florence” and stood on its own as a cultural curiosity that brought in local and international viewers in droves (figure 1). Andrea di Cione, or “Orcagna” as he was known to contemporaries, received the commission to sculpt this absolutely massive ensemble in 1352, some four years after the passing of the Black Death. The commission to replace the previous tabernacle that had stood since the second decade of the century may have been initiated by the Captains of the Confraternity of Orsanmichele as a response to the extensive criticism it had just received for the way in which they handled and then spent the windfall of profits the institution had just accepted after the wills of thousands of Florentine plague victims were opened and their bequests distributed all at the same time. Matteo Villani, in his Chronicle of Florence, vehemently condemned the captains, accusing them of embezzlement and condemning them for their selfishness. Orcagna received his commission shortly thereafter. Orcagna designed the tabernacle as an architectonic edifice that approximates the loggia form used so frequently by confraternities across the city. A two-tiered grate surrounds the square loggia on all four sides, with each corner articulated by similarly twisted column clusters that form hefty piers from which spring the ribs of the vault (figure 2). The rounded arches provide sightlines for the miraculous painting on three sides. Pinnacles and pediments extend toward the ceiling, and serve to partially conceal a ribbed dome that may well symbolize the heavens above. Book-wielding evangelists and angels stand on these piers and columns to assert the textual and spiritual authority of the Virgin Mary. The pedestal upon which this loggia sits has been adorned with a series of relief panels dedicated to scenes from the Life of the Virgin Mary, an appropriate subject given the presence of the painted miracle-working Madonna in the middle of the tabernacle. Among them appear the Birth of the Virgin, the Education of the Mary, the Annunciation, the Presentation of Christ, and the Dormition and Assumption of the Virgin, all of which demonstrate a similar approach to spatial flatness, volumetric mass, and gestural message. Circling up and around the actual picture appear sets of angels who pull back a marble curtain in a manner that probably replicates the solemn ritual that was performed every time the Madonna was unveiled for privileged viewers, whereby an actual curtain was lifted up by custodians who were seated inside the back of the tabernacle, pulling on ropes unseen by those standing in the church. Increasingly during the fourteenth century, these visitors tended to be non-Florentines of high standing, as the previously open arches along the sides of the building in which the tabernacle was located were gradually walled up and the miraculous image inside was covered for its own protection. Orcagna’s tabernacle received great acclaim almost as soon as it was completed. Only months after its installation in 1359, the artist was offered the position of Master of the Cathedral by the canons of the Duomo in the papal retreat town of Orvieto, about halfway between Florence and Rome: that endeavor lasted roughly three years, and by 1362 Orcagna was back in Florence, where he soon accepted the commission to produce a painted effigy of St. Matthew for the Arte del Cambio, or Bankers Guild, of Florence. The decision to name the miracle-working picture inside it as the official painting of the city seems to have motivated, in part, by the sumptuous sculptural loggia that Orcagna had built around it. And when Stefano Marchioni wrote his chronicle of the city in 1377, Orcagna’s s Baldacchino was the only work of art that the author bothered to mention, thus prioritizing this sculpture over the paintings by Giotto, the reliefs by Andrea Pisano, and the architecture of Arnolfo di Cambio as the image of primacy in a city filled with other logical candidates.

Like the building history of S. Maria Novella, its rival counterpart to the west, S. Croce’s church and dependencies evolved steadily through the fourteenth century. Burial chapels in the transept were secured by families like the Bardi, Peruzzi, Baroncelli, and Castellani families, some of the most powerful and privileged in all of Florence. In keeping with their status, the city’s finest artists were commissioned to produce mural and panel decorations there: Giotto, Taddeo Gaddi, and Maso di Banco worked there in the first half of the Trecento, while Giovanni da Milano, Angolo Gaddi, and Niccolò di Pietro Gerini painted frescoes there between 1365 and 1390. This artistic legacy was extended into the fifteenth century, as Donatello and Antonio Rossellino produced impressive sculptures in the nave, and an architect (traditionally identified as Filippo Brunelleschi, but now thought to have been Domenico Michelozzo) designed and constructed the Pazzi Chapel between 1434 and 1474 using a stylistic vocabulary consistent with that seen in the facade of the Ospedale degli Innocenti. A site of enormous civic significance, the corpse of Michelangelo Buonarroti was delivered and interred here after the artist’s death in 1564, and the monument erected in the south wall of the nave near the entrance still attracts pilgrims to this day. Since then, major monuments have been installed in the nave to celebrate the lives and accomplishments of Italy’s most famous writers, scientists, and inventors.",

        "content"  : "Baptism in Florence The ritual of baptism was a crucial feature of fourteenth- and fifteenth-century Florence. This symbolic practice carried both a spiritual and social weight integral for full participation in the fabric of Florentine society. Baptism was not only a means of defense against hellfire, but an introduction to civic society and a foundational moment in each individual’s life. While some of the finer details of the practice are unclear to contemporary scholars, we now know that by 1128 the ritual was performed at the octagonal Baptistery of San Giovanni, located directly across from the cathedral. Christian baptism was first practiced by John the Baptist—patron saint of the city of Florence—as evidenced in the New Testament Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. In these narratives, Jesus sees John baptizing his followers and walks into the River Jordan to participate, thus cementing the ritual as one of the sacraments of the Christian church. In keeping with this tradition, the ritual originally consisted of the individual being immersed in water, signifying the washing away of sin and marking one as both a child of God and a member of the Church, but with the practice changing over time to center on infant baptisms, the ritual cleansing was changed from full immersion to a mere sprinkling of water on the top of the newborn’s head, probably to avoid the embarrassing possibility of accidentally drowning the child who had been brought before the font. Originally, adult baptisms were performed only on Holy Saturday (between Good Friday and Easter Sunday) and the Pentecost vigil, but this changed as the city’s population grew during the late Middle Ages – and as the specter of infant mortality reared its ugly head. As parents sought to preserve the souls of their children and spare them from eternal punishment, babies were often baptized within days of their birth. These doctrinal fears were only exacerbated as the Black Death swept through Europe during the mid-14th century, killing tens of thousands in Florence alone and underscoring the prevailing notion that the only hope lay in the promise of an afterlife – but a promise that could only be sealed through baptism. The ritual itself began with the parents (usually just the father) and godparents processing through the streets, carrying the child, to the south doors of the baptistery where they would be met by the priest (“Baptism, Movement” 134). After performing a few initial rituals, prayers, and blessings to cleanse the child of unclean spirits, the priest then invited the parent and godparents to bring the child into the baptistery (136-7). Once inside, more prayers were spoken over the child, it was anointed with oil, and finally received the baptism by having water sprinkled or poured on its head while the priest recited the words of Christ from Matthew 28:19 “I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit” (143-9). The rise of this practice of infant baptism necessarily increased the volume of individuals seeking baptism at San Giovanni, and so by the late 13th century baptisms were held daily instead of only a handful of times a year (“The Two Fonts” 87). The practice of infant baptism also paved the way for the social impact of the ritual; as baptisms were public events, the baptism of a child was her or his introduction to the Florentine community (78). The child publicly received a name during the ritual, while newly appointed godparents stood in attendance, the latter of which were particularly instrumental in the child’s socioeconomic advancement. These godparents were often selected by parents for their communal connections, and could result in the creation or strengthening of financial or political alliances, in much the same way that such connections could be formed through advantageous marriages for children (Haas). The social importance of baptism was emphasized in the creation of the public fresco of the Abandonment of Children and the Reunification of Families by Niccolò di Pietro Gerini and Ambrogio di Baldese in 1386. Painted on the wall of the Bigallo immediately opposite the south doors of the baptistery, this fresco was displayed to “the most important zone of the piazza” (Bent 95). Portraying members of the Confraterntiy of the Misericordia accepting children into their orphanage and then returning those children to their families, the Abandonment of Children and the Reunification of Families served to remind the caregivers of newly baptized infants of their parental responsibilities, and of the aid offered by the Confraternity should those responsibilities become too burdensome (96). This fresco is one image among many which testifies to the centrality of proper parenting in Florentine society. Taking place daily, in the center of the city, in front of the greatest church in Florence, the ritual of baptism was a fixture of Renaissance Florence whose practice greatly influenced both the communal and familial spheres of life.

In place of a doctor, a midwife without formal instruction but trained by experience served as the main help to a woman in labor. After delivering the baby, the midwife cut the umbilical cord, washed and swaddled the child, and announced the baby to the gathered friends and family. A hired guardadonna also attended to the mother and assisted the midwife with the delivery. In some households, slaves or domestic servants also acted as assistants. While childbirth afforded Florentine women a rare moment of reprieve from the male gaze, certain practices both challenged and reinforced the lack of agency afforded to the typical middle- or upper-class woman. Though this space distinctly lacked a male presence, the responsibility for hiring and paying these women often fell on the husband. Without suffering through the horrors of childbirth by his wife’s side, a husband subtly influenced the process from afar. Men happily left the women to their work during labor because childbirth came with a unique set of dangers and fears. The laboring Florentine mother walked the same tenuous line between life and death that the modern mother does, though without the aid of modern technology and medicine. Florentine women, however, created their own arsenal of aids, especially religious ones. Besides praying to the Virgin Mary, women sometimes turned to the tale of St. Margaret (who was reputed to have performed a miracle when she was swallowed by a dragon and emerged unharmed) to focus on the safe delivery of her baby through intense pain. Wine took the edge off the pain to some degree, but the screams coming from a woman’s room still deterred any curious man from entering. Despite the many assistants, the risk of death remained high for both the woman and her newborn child. One estimate based on data from the years 1424, 1425, and 1430 claims that childbirth accounted for one-fifth of the deaths of married Florentine women. Even if both mother and child initially survived, the threat of infection, illness, or a fresh wave of the Black Death discouraged parents from getting too attached to their children. The practice of sending children to wet nurses or balia within just days of their birth and baptism contributed to the emotional separation between parent and child necessary for surviving uncertain times. This distant attitude toward young children manifested in glaring oversights in catasto records such as the underreporting of infants and generous rounding of ages. Though helpful as a coping mechanism, this separation also deprived a mother of an opportunity to exert some influence over her children, a facet of a woman’s life usually considered safely within the domestic realm and thus properly under her control.

        "content"  : "The Guelph-Ghibelline Rivalry A combination of factors led to the conflict between Guelphs and Ghibellines in Florence during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Although the aggressive actions of Emperor Frederick I catalyzed the Guelph vs Ghibelline rivalry, it was a young Florentine nobleman named Buondelmonte de’Buondelmonti who caused the local rivalry to spiral into bitter violence. The terms Guelph and Ghibelline have Germanic origins. The former developed from the house of Welf, a dynasty of Bavarian dukes who fought for the imperial throne through the later Middle Ages. The latter originated from the name of a castle called Waiblingen, the seat of the Hohenstaufen dukes of Swabia and the family that governed the Holy Roman Empire – and the enemies of the Welf family. These terms acquired significance in northern Italy during the reign of the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbossa. Frederick advanced south of the Alps in 1175, determined to reassert imperial authority over northern Italy. Fearing a threat to his own political potentcy in Lombardy, the newly elected Pope Alexander III firmly opposed Frederick’s aggressive conquest, resulting in a split peninsula: the Guelphs in support of the papacy and the Ghibellines in support of the emperor. With the help of his Lombard League, Pope Alexander III eventually triumphed over Frederick I at Legnano in 1176, restoring order to the relationship between emperor and pope. However, the rivalry between the two camps continued to simmer all through the region. This rivalry came to a boil in Florence after a fierce altercation involving several rival families in 1216. According to the chronicle of Dino Compagni (ca. 1310), a Florentine Guelph nobleman Boundelmonte de’Buondelmonti had promised to take as his wife a daughter of a local patrician named Oderigo Giantruffetti. Before the marriage took place, Buondelmonte was offered an alternate bride, the daughter of Madonna Aldruda, a Ghibelline gentlewoman from the Donati house. Although betrothed to another, Buondelmonte accepted this proposal and reneged on his earlier agreement with the Giantruffetti, an action which infuriated Oderigo and his family. Incensed by this act of humiliaiton, Oderigo and his allies vowed to avenge his daughter and set out to Buondelmonte on the day of his marriage. However, a member of the Uberti family intercepted their action and convinced them to murder the treacherous groom instead of merely assaulting him: the assassination forced Florentines to take sides – probably based on pre-existing animosities and alliances between families – which in turn developed into an unending social and political rift that split the city. At this point, officials lost their ability to control rampant political polarization and violence. Florence became a toxic factionalized environment. As internal conflict plagued Florence, the city ignored imperial authority and followed its own policy preferences, which routinely favored papal political interests. This insubordination angered Emperor Frederick II who advanced into Italy in 1237 on the pretense of quelling this disobedience. In response to the instability in Florence, the Emperor appointed one of his illegitimate sons, Frederick of Antioch, as Podestà of Florence. The arrival of this imperial bastard renewed quarrels among the Florentine aristocracy, thereby worsening the savage disputes between Guelphs and Ghibellines. What had begun as an international crisis between pope and emperor devolved into a local crisis, which then developed into an international affair once again.

        "content"  : "Agnolo Gaddi (1350-1396) Agnolo Gaddi was born into an artistic family sometime around 1350. His father, Taddeo Gaddi, was a Florentine painter and architect; his grandfather, Gaddo di Zanobi, was a Florentine artist credited with the mosaic of the Coronation of the Virgin in the Duomo. Agnolo’s father, Taddeo, studied with the great Giotto di Bondone and painted in Giotto’s style throughout his prominent artistic career. Taddeo taught his sons, Agnolo and Giovanni, how to paint through the same methods that Giotto taught him, connecting Agnolo’s pedigree back to that influential painter. As a student of the Giotto school of painting, Agnolo painted with a high sense of naturalism, aiming to portray his figures with a realistic sense of perspective, and allowing for an authentic engagement between the viewer and the painting. In achieving such Giotto-esque naturalism, Agnolo earned the bids for numerous commissions throughout his short career, including Papal commissions, altarpieces, and other religious frescos. Agnolo began his formal painting career in 1369 in Rome with his brother, Giovanni. From July to October they completed a project to decorate a portion of the Vatican, commissioned by Pope Urban the Fifth, that they shared with the established Lombard painter, Giovanni da Milano. After completing the decoration in the Vatican, Agnolo’s name is not seen in records until 1376, when he appears in Florence. His name is recorded with more frequency in the 1380s, as he received a series of painterly commissions; this includes what has come to be known as his best and most prominent work, the series dedicated to the Legend of the True Cross in the Cappella Maggiore of the Church of Santa Croce. Agnolo received many other commissions throughout the 1380s and 1390s, including the paintings Madonna Enthroned with Saint and Angels, Coronation of the Virgin, Madonna of Humility with Angels, and Crucifixion. Agnolo’s ability to create a unification throughout a composition made him a highly coveted painter during the late fourteenth century, yet his talents were not solely confined to painting. Agnolo’s name appears on statues for the façade of the Cathedral of Florence, indicating that he was likely the designer or gilder of these statues. He was not solely a painter, rather he was a “renaissance man”, equipped with skills and knowledge to excel in multiple crafts. Agnolo’s death in 1396 put an end to a successful and imaginative artistic career. He was buried in the Church of Santa Croce on October 16, 1396. Agnolo Gaddi boasts achievements for being the last painter under the Giotto-style techniques, while also being an excellent designer of sculptures. Bibliography Cole, Bruce.

        "content"  : "Alberto Arnoldi (ca. 1320 - 1370) Alberto Arnoldi appears to have been born in Florence, although the date of his birth has never been discovered. Indeed, practically nothing about this sculptor of note is known, and our understanding of his work and his legacy comes down to us only circumstantially. Arnoldi must have been highly regarded by his peers and his patrons. His abilities were such that the officers of the Company of the Misericordia hired him to sculpt two different projects in the late 1350s and early 1360s for their residence on the Piazza S. Giovanni, now known as the Bigallo. They chose him, the documents in the Archivio di Stato di Firenze say, because they believed the quality of his sculptures would be comparable to those recently completed by Andrea Pisano for the Baptistery and the Campanile: [The] captains of this confraternity … deliberated on the following things: First, they agreed to offer to Alberto Arnoldi, master from the parish of San Michele Berteldi, the commission to produce an image in marble of Our Lady holding her Son in her arms … with two angels…. All of these figures must be by the hand of Alberto, who shall receive a salary of 55 florins for the figure of our Lady and one hundred thirty florins for the two angels, who should be holding candles in their hands: the figure of Mary should be of a higher quality than the figure of Our Lady in Pisa. Its quality will be judged by three or four masters deemed to be qualified by the city of Florence, which shall appoint them at the time. And if it is deemed to be inferior to the one in Pisa, the Bigallo will not be obligated to keep it. And the images of the marble angels must be of the same quality and beauty of the said figure of Mary. He will be paid in the following manner: he will recieve an initial payment of one hundred gold florins, and when the figure of Our Lady has been completed to our satisfaction he will have fifty gold florins, and when he has completed the angels he will receive fifty gold florins; he will compose and install in the oratory the figures at his own expense. And the figures will be completed in two years from the time of their initiation, as indicated by the date of the first payment of one hundred florins. When work was completed in 1361, Alberto Arnoldi received his payments. At precisely this time, that is in 1358, Arnoldi was selected to serve as the administrator of art works to be produced in the cathedral of Florence, the walls of which were then being built up around the old church of S. Reparata (still in use despite being enveloped by the much larger S. Maria del Fiore that was rising up all around it). Arnoldi must have been an artist of note. However, we must temper this evaluation with important caveats. First, Arnoldi produced very few works that have survived to this day. The only works we can ascribe to him convincingly are the Madonna and Angels altar inside the Bigallo and the Madonna and Child on its façade. Were he truly a valued sculptor in that period, surely we would have more works from his hand. Second, Arnoldi’s name does not appear in documents that address the most important sculptural projects of the day: he was not involved in the production of Andrea di Cione’s massive Baldacchino installed in Orsanmichele, the continuation of the project to add reliefs to the Campanile, or the carving of figures for the façade of the Duomo. While he obviously caught the eye of the Captains of the Bigallo, he was not considered in the same league as Andrea. And third, despite his work for the Bigallo and inside the Duomo, Arnoldi’s output was not large enough or interesting enough to warrant comment by Lorenzo Ghiberti in his 15th-century art history text (the Commentarii) or by Giorgio Vasari in his 16th-century Lives of the Artists, both of whom devoted at least passing references to a host of other equally undistinguished craftsmen. Alberto Arnoldi was the fourteenth-century equivalent of a One-Hit Wonder. The sculptures for the Bigallo are all that’s left for us to consider from his career.

        "content"  : "The Albizzi Family The obsession with power among Florentine elites that revolved around a desire to enjoy political immunity and tax concessions defined the latter half of the Trecento. These elite aligned themselves in several ways, including through familial alliances, guilds, and political parties. The Albizzi family in particular rose to power during the last quarter of the fourteenth century through their increasing influence over bureaucratic offices and their perceived interest in the common good. The Albizzi first moved to Florence from Arezzo in the twelfth century, and thanks to their acumen as wool merchants and financiers, by the beginning of the Trecento had established themselves as one of the most prominent popolano families. As a result, their political influence swelled in the second half of the Trecento. By the 1360s, two rival factions emerged: the Albizzi who represented the Parte Guelfa (who advocated for alliances with the Papacy and Naples) and the Ricci family who advocated for more popular representation. The rival factions fought bitterly until 1372 when the Florentine Signoria declared that the Albizzi were banned from holding public office for five years. During this ban one of the most prominent members of the Albizzi lineage, Maso degli Albizzi, first experienced the sting of political defeat as he was ousted from his first political role in Pistoia, a region under Florentine control. But his humiliation was short-lived, as Maso returned to lead the Florentine Signoria after the Ciompi Revolt ended in 1382. The Albizzi managed to grab power in the city after a lengthy and at times violent period that followed the disastrous military campaign against the Papacy, known as the War of the Eight Saints (1375-1378), that had sucked the city’s revenues dry and imposed on the Florentine population unusually restrictive religious penalties that drained the population’s patience with its political representatives. In 1378, a coalition comprised of underrepresented laboring guilds and members of the sotto posti – people who did not belong to any guild at all – staged an uprising against the middle and upper guilds whose quasi-republican government had for decades disenfranchised these laborers by preventing their participation in the government. Curiously, these rebellious laborers – known by the collective term Ciompi – found allies in the leaders of the two rival factions of the Albizzi and the Ricci families, who saw in the revolt an opportunity to weaken the government’s power in a time of civil strife. This led to the so-called Ciompi Revolt of June 1378 which, in a watered-down form, lasted until January 1382. During this time, a more egalitarian system of civic representation was established in which merchants, artisans, and laborers held an equal proportion of offices with an equal share of power. The government was short-lived as alliances amongst laboring factions dissolved and a coalition of merchants, industrialists, and artisans suppressed civil the more progressive impulses of the Ciompi. By early 1382, the laborers and their leaders were under the control of the elites once again. The oligarchic regime that governed Florence in the wake of the Ciompi Revolt moved to return the city’s politicaly system to one that favored the interests of the elites at the expense of laborers. This political machine was run by the patricians of the city who controlled both commerce and policy initiatiaves; at the helm of this machine was Maso degli Albizzi, an intuitive politician known for his personal charisma, charm, and diplomatic grace. Maso and his fellow patricians negated the egalitarian reforms created during the Ciompi period and reinstituted a structure that gave a greater voice (and a substantial majority in committees) to greater guildsmen. With Maso at the helm, a system was installed and maintained that increased the income disparity between the Haves and Have-Nots, realigned the city with the papal authority, and enhanced its military posture during the subsequent period of internecine Italian conflicts. It also overtly underrepresented the lower classes in the political process, and utterly excluded the sotto posti, people in surrounding territories of Florence, and the city’s most destitute constituents. Maso’s control of the government lasted until his death in 1417, at which time his son Rinaldo degli Albizzi took control of the city until his faction’s demise at the hands of Cosimo de’Medici in 1434.

        "content"  : "Andrea della Robbia The distinctive roundels on the Loggia feature white glazed terracotta infants on blue backgrounds. Set between the arches of the Loggia, the ten sculpted children have become the symbols of the Ospedale degli Innocenti. Sculpted figures in lunettes were often employed to distinguish a building’s façade from those of other similar structures in the city, but the Innocenti’s emphasis on the function of the hospital created an unprecedented level of clarity. The roundels represent the Innocenti as an institution, revealing a depth of history about the hospital’s segno, and stylistically, they speak to the mastery of Andrea della Robbia. The infants in the roundels represent the Ospedale degli Innocenti’s segno. During the opening ceremony of the hospital in 1445 the rector Lapo di Piero Pacini wore a black robe adorned with a bambino on his chest. This insignia was also depicted on the lead reliquary box associated with the dedication of the church hospital, which was in 1451. The original version of the insignia featured a child being placed in a pila, a receptacle located under the loggia. This iconography clearly identified the child as a foundling and connected the segno with the mission of the hospital. In records in the Innocenti’s archives, an artist was paid for 104 painted bambolini on pieces of paper that could be attached to the foundlings’ chests. This repetitive imagery clearly establishes the image of the infant in the pila as a symbol of the Innocenti itself. The practice of relating the segno to the work of a specific institution was common, but the emblem of a child was unprecedented in Florence. The image of the Innocenti’s segno changed over time, and after 1460 was represented as a standing swaddled infant, which was more easily reproduced than the infant in the pila. The recognizable symbol was found on two volumes of Ricordanze in hospital archives, paired with the symbol of the Silk Guild. This iconography can be associated with the Christian tradition of holy figures, such as Christ, the Virgin Mary, and John the Baptist being represented as swaddled infants. The tight swaddles communicate safety and security, which the hospital provides its foundlings. This is the image that is portrayed on the roundels. These swaddled infants resemble putti, which, combined with Brunelleschi’s architecture, visually connect to the putti reliefs on Donatello’s tabernacle of Sant Louis of Toulouse. The ten roundels represent a similar segno but each contain creative differences. The first and tenth roundels depict infants with a contrapposto pose and a bent arm to accommodate the capital of the pilasters. The other infants have both of their arms out, and the even numbered roundels depict infants looking left and the odd ones looking right. Although Andrea della Robbia seems to follow this pattern, each of the infants differ in facial expression and depiction of their bodies. The second infant exposes his foot, and the ninth infant has a brown cloth under the swaddling. On the fifth roundel, the infant’s bands fall, exposing his male genitalia. On the tenth infant, the swaddling falls to his knees, perhaps indicating the growth of a child. These creative variations to the official segno and the brilliant blue background are masterful. In his History of Florence (1423), merchant Goro Dati described the Innocenti and praised its insignia, which shaped how the Florentine people perceived the institution and its function. The swaddled infant as an emblem was unprecedented and developed over time to become a recognizable symbol. Andrea della Robbia’s roundels reflect this desire to establish an official insignia, and his work at the Innocenti became famous in its own right. Bibliography Domestici, Fiamma.

        "content"  : "Andrea di Bonaiuto (ca. 1325-1379) Born around 1325, the painter Andrea di Bonaiuto survived the bubonic plague which swept through Florence in 1348 and worked in Pisa and Florence until his death in 1379. Relatively few archival records of his life remain, and he signed and dated virtually none of his works. However, his most significant achievement, the fresco cycle in the chapterhouse of Santa Maria Novella (for which documents do survive), serves as one of the great artistic triumphs of the Trecento, and provides important insights into Florentine religious life. Andrea entered the Florentine Guild of Doctors and Apothecaries in 1346 and, beginning in 1351, lived in the quarter of Santa Maria Novella that was named for the great basilica of the Dominican Order. His work bears resemblance to that of Nardo di Cione (ca. 1320-1365), another Florentine artist with whom he may have apprenticed. Andrea left Florence in 1355 to work in Pisa for roughly ten years. When he returned in 1365, he received the commission to decorate the walls of Santa Maria Novella’s chapterhouse, now known as the Spanish Chapel. In return for his work, Zanobi Guasconi, the prior of Santa Maria Novella at the time, granted Andrea and his wife a house valued at sixty-five florins (the modern equivalent of roughly $130,000). Andrea’s contract stated that he complete the project within a period of two years, beginning on January 1, 1366, and he appears to have honored this stipulation. The Dominican chapterhouse served as one of the focal points of daily Dominican life and ritual. Many liturgical and ceremonial functions took place there, as well as the day-to-day administration of the chapter. Upon the arrivals of prominent visitors, the Dominicans would have guided their guests first to the chapterhouse, the center of their organization. Thus, the pictures that decorated the chapterhouse would have been seen by the Dominicans on a daily basis and would represent their chapter to visitors. Although one of the Dominicans probably devised the mural cycle’s sophisticated program, their decision to commission Andrea for the chapterhouse decorations demonstrates their esteem for him and his work. Scenes from the Passion of Christ make up the cycle’s central image, with images of the Way to Calvary, the Crucifixion, and the Harrowing of Hell covering the north wall of the chapel. Other images such as the Via Veritatis depict Saints Dominic, Peter Martyr, and Thomas Aquinas celebrating the intellectual and spiritual triumphs of the Order. In the same year he received the chapterhouse commission, civic leaders in Florence appointed Andrea to a committee tasked with designing the dome for Florence’s cathedral. He served as a committee member for two years until 1367, and the representation of the domed cathedral in the Via Veritatis surely reflects his own conception of how that cupola ought to have looked. Andrea spent brief periods of the next ten years working in both Orvieto and Pisa. Upon his death in 1379, he left behind only a meager sum for his widow and child, suggesting that Andrea’s expenses largely outpaced his revenues. Despite the rather quiet end to his career, Andrea’s frescos on the walls of Santa Maria Novella’s chapterhouse document Dominican identity, preserve examples of their particular world view, and present their take on larger issues of Christian ideology. These images stand as some of western Europe’s most important achievements of late fourteenth-century painting.

        "content"  : "Andrea Pisano As his surname suggests, Andrea Pisano came from the city of Pisa, located some 45 miles to the west of Florence on the banks of the Mediterranean Sea. Although not directly descended from the father-son team of Nicola and Giovanni Pisano, Andrea’s contributions to the legacy of fourteenth-century art are no less important than those of his more famous predecessors. Archival references to Andrea’s birth and upbringing have not survived, but later records indicate that the sculptor came from a small village called Pontedera that was, at the turn of the fourteenth century, under Pisan control. His father was a notary named Ugolino, and as an adolescent Andrea was sent to Pisa to apprentice as a goldsmith. He soon branched out into the world of sculpture and was active carving wooden figures in and around Pisa in the early 1320s. He seems to have worked in Siena and Orvieto as well, and by the beginning of the next decade had acquired a reputation elevated enough to earn him the commission from the Arte della Calimala to design, cast, and chase the monumental reliefs for the south doors of the Florentine Baptistery of S. Giovanni. An inscription on that door dates the early phase of this project to 1330, and the last of the panels was installed just before June 24, 1336, the all-important Feast of St. John the Baptist. As this project came to a conclusion, Andrea picked up a second major commission, this one from the Arte della Lana, or Wool Guild. As Giotto oversaw the design and construction of the foundations for the Campanile adjacent to the cathedral, Andrea was charged with the task of producing marble reliefs dedicated to scenes from Genesis. When Giotto died in 1337, however, Andrea appears to have taken control over the entire project: he seems to have revised the architectural plans for the structure, even then showing signs of weakness, and added a sculptural program that revolved around the subjects of the Labors of Man, the Madonna and Child, and the Sibyls and Prophets that were placed in the zone of the niches. Although his name has been associated with the construction of Orsanmichele, there is no way to confirm his role in the design of that building. By 1343 Andrea had returned to his homeland, where he formed a working partnership with his son, Tino, in the city of Pisa. He stayed there for four years, overseeing the design and completion of a number of monumental sculptures for various churches in the city, including the cathedral, S. Caterina, and S. Maria della Spina. But in 1347 he moved back to Orvieto to take up duties of capomaestro of the cathedral’s works, a short-lived endeavor. By 1349, Andrea was either dead or retired, with Nino taking over for him as head of the works for that site. The absence of references to him after that year suggests that Andrea Pisano, like so many others in Europe, fell victim to the Black Death of 1348. Style and Influence Andrea Pisano’s stylistic choices reveal a faithful adherence to the traditions forged by his senior Pisan forebear, Giovanni Pisano. With a preference for elongated figures that sway with Gothic undulations, Andrea’s approach to narrative and didactic art intentionally sacrifices rational order and distinctively naturalistic settings in order to highlight emotionally charged and dramatically compelling actions. Diminutive trees, abstracted mountains, and streams that have no perceptible banks serve merely as contexts for the more important gestural and expressive qualities of characters that Andrea tries to imbue with spiritual vivacity. Andrea Pisano’s role in shaping the late medieval taste for sculpture in Florence cannot be exaggerated. The south portal of the Baptistery of S. Giovanni was the most important setting for the all-important ritual of baptism that welcomed infants into the community and forged essential links between parents, godparents, and family members. Andrea’s reliefs literally and figuratively framed that ritual after their completion in 1336, and it’s safe to say that every single person who had been born or who had parented a child in the city after that year had spent a long time looking at them at least once in her or his lifetime. The hexagonal and diamond-shaped reliefs that Andrea executed for the Campanile, while more difficult to see due to their elevated placement, were among the only other public works of sculpture that anyone could examine in Florence: the effigies in the niches of Orsanmichele, many of the sculptures for the façade of the Duomo, and Ghiberti’s relief panels for the North and East doors of the Baptistery all came decades later. The power of this Pisan artist at first served as an influential exemplum of the fashionable style in sculpture that was all the rage in Pisa, Paris, and beyond, and then later served as the foil for those artists of the next generations who aimed to alter that style and the tastes that celebrated it. Andrea Pisano both set the standard that future sculptors strove to meet and represented all the things they hoped to avoid. Bibliography Moskowitz, Anita.

        "content"  : "Arnolfo di Cambio (ca. 1240-1302) Although Arnolfo di Cambio is best known for his architectural achievements in Florence, the Sienese sculptor and architect (c. 1240) began as a student and assistant to Nicola Pisano, who many consider the leading figure in the art of sculpture, just as Giotto was an innovator in painting. During his time under Nicola Pisano, Arnolfo helped with the construction of the reliefs for the marble pulpit of Siena Cathedral (1265) and those for the Tomb of San Dominic (1264-67). Arnolfo developed his classical style during this period and continued working in this idiom throughout his career. Although he remained heavily influenced by Nicola Pisano in Siena, Arnolfo’s own style evolved after his move to Rome around 1277. While in the service of Charles of Anjou, Arnolfo revived the classical past in works such as the representation of the enthroned French Duke (c. 1280), which is thought to be one of the earliest portrait statues since ancient times, and the bronze statue of St. Peter for the Vatican (c. 1290), which is still venerated by pilgrims to this day. Arnolfo also carved the innovative Monument to Cardinal De Braye (1282) in the church of S. Domenico, Orvieto. By combining the classicist’s attention to volume and proportion with the elegance and intricacy of a Gothicizing artist, the sculptor created a theatrical scene that relates the death of the cardinal to his eternal salvation above. The style and construction that he used would influence wall tombs for over a century. Arnolfo di Cambio’s two altar canopies in San Paolo fuori le Mura (1285) and Santa Cecilia in Trastevere (1293) suggest his engagement with the Rayonnant Gothic style typically associated with the patronage of Louis IX of France. While both canopies demonstrate a keen eye towards form, proportion, and geometry, the employment of lacework, intricate patterns, and columns that taper toward the top suggest an awareness of the French artistic tradition. Other works that suggest Arnolfo’s responsiveness to this style include the Ciboria at St. Paul’s (1284), the Annibaldi monument in Saint John Lateran (c.1290), the Crib of Santa Maria Maggiore (1285-91), and the Chapel of St. Boniface (c. 1296). Although he contributed greatly to the beautification of the city, Arnolfo di Cambio lived in Florence for only a short time. Originally brought in as a consultant for the construction of the cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore in 1296 (completed only in 1436 when Filippo Brunelleschi finished the famous cupola over the building’s crossing), recent research suggests that the basic layout of Santa Croce was also designed by Arnolfo in 1295, and Vasari attributed to Arnolfo the designs for the Palazzo Vecchio (initiated in 1298). His sculpted works can be seen in the façade of the Duomo, which include the Nativity, the Dormition (destroyed), and the Madonna and Child (1296), as well as the effigy of the Enthroned Pope Boniface VIII that harkens back to Arnolfo’s images of St. Peter and Charles of Anjou in Rome. For his work in Florence, Arnolfo di Cambio would be honored by the Council of One Hundred in 1300, but the artist enjoyed this prestigious award only briefly: his activity was cut short by his untimely death in 1302.

        "content"  : "Bernardo Daddi A late contemporary of the famous painter Giotto di Bondone, Bernardo Daddi (ca. 1280 – 1348) became one of Florence’s most popular and most important producers of panel pictures during the two decades that preceded the advent of Bubonic Plague. The identity of his master remains unclear, and speculations range from Giotto himself to obscure miniaturists like the elusive Master of the Dominican Effigies. His approach to figures and scenes belies an understanding of popular trends in Trecento painting, with a complete reliance on layered hues of egg tempera pigments creating colorful (if somewhat rigid) forms that immediately capture one’s attention. But Daddi was no slavish imitator, and he intentionally departed from the naturalistic and expressive figures produced by his more famous predecessor in his quest for painting characters deserving of devotional attention from viewers. His traditionalist, somewhat conservative approach retained much of the brilliance of earlier Tuscan painting in Florence and nearby Siena without the addition of potentially distracting gestural or overly emotional elements. The first mention of Bernardo Daddi appears in a document dated 1312, when the artist matriculated into the Arte dei Medici e Speziali (Guild of the Doctors and Apothecaries), which included in its membership the painters of Florence. He signed his name on a triptych (now in the Uffizi, Florence) in 1328, and did the same in 1333 at the base of a similarly designed devotional painting now in the Bigallo. At that point, the painter began to enjoy considerable favor among local patrons. Daddi’s works dotted the Florentine urban landscape by the time of his death in 1348, and the location of his paintings reveals both his popularity with lay viewers and his importance as something of a civil servant. In addition to the altarpiece he produced for the Dominicans in S. Maria Novella and the frescoes of Saint Stephen that he painted in the massive Franciscan church of S. Croce, Daddi’s images adorned the audience hall of the Misericordia, the guild residence of the Arte dei Medici e Speziali, the high altar of the cathedral, and in 1335 the private chapel for the city’s governors inside the Palazzo della Signoria. He was responsible for a popular pictorial type called the Madonna del Bagnuolo, produced in the mid-1330s, a painting within a painting that shows the activation of an altarpiece before devotees on bended knee before it. In 1346 Daddi was the painter selected by the Captains of Orsanmichele to replace a miracle-working panel that had adorned a column there in the grain distribution center since at least 1292. Indeed, Daddi’s version of this cult image gained an immediate following after its completion in 1347, as confraternity members soon engulfed the single dossal panel within Andrea Orcagna’s enormous and elaborate sculpted marble baldachin, the likes of which had never been seen before, and the single object that consistently received praise as the most important impressive object in the entire commune. Were it not for the massive and extensive polyptych that the painter produced for the high altar of the Duomo in 1342, known today as the S. Pancrazio Altarpiece and exhibited today in the Uffizi Musuems, the Madonna of Osanmichele would have been his best-known painting. Daddi was obviously a trusted commodity, and that fact that his rise to prominence and popularity among some of the city’s most important civic patrons coincides almost exactly with the election of Giotto to the post of “City Artist” in 1334 suggests that public commissions may have been sub-contracted by Giotto to Daddi as the older artist’s output slowed near the end of his life. Although Giotto is usually credited with the transition away from “Romanesque” or “Byzantine” painting to a more proto-Renaissance style, it was Bernardo Daddi who probably had the greatest impact on successive generations of Florentine artists. His students appear to have included Andrea Orcagna and possibly Nardo di Cione, the two brothers who survived the plague of 1348 and inherited the mantel of “Best Artists Alive” soon thereafter. Their students – among them Andrea di Bonaiuto, Jacopo di Cione, Giovanni del Biondo, and probably Niccolò di Pietro Gerini – went on to train the next generation of great Florentine artists (including, probably, Lorenzo Monaco), and so on, right on into the middle of the fifteenth century. Blasphemous as it may sound, there is more of Bernardo Daddi’s art and legacy to be found in Trecento Florence than that of Giotto’s.

        "content"  : "Fabio Borbottoni: Railroad Employee, Amateur Painter, Unrepentant Romantic Fabio Borbottoni (1823-1901), a minor official in the Italian Railroad system, practiced painting as a hobby. The Florentine native produced over 120 small, square pictures of the city’s medieval structures as they appeared to him during the years of the Risorgimento – the period of Italian unification and statehood that arose during the decade of the 1860s and the latter decades of the nineteenth century when a national identity began to formulate. It was precisely during this period that the city’s built environment changed dramatically. Medieval walls that ringed the ancient urban core were demolished, with only a few of the major gateways preserved for posterity’s sake. Laborers attached marble facades to the Duomo and the basilica of S. Croce to create a kind of harmony in keeping with original facings on the Baptistery of S. Giovanni, the friary of S. Maria Novella, and the monastic church of S. Miniato al Monte. Old structures along the river, like the old mills run by the city mint, were torn down and replaced by wide avenues that cut along both sides of the Arno. Most importantly, the very heart of the Florentine commercial district – that which contained the ancient Mercato Vecchio, a dozen of the city’s medieval guild headquarters, and the adjacent Jewish Ghetto formed in the 15th century – was completely demolished and replaced with newer boutiques, public buildings, and a square dubbed the Piazza della Republica, all of which was inspired by a Parisian style of urban planning then popular in Europe. The social and architectural character of Old Florence was quickly dying. Borbottoni lamented the destruction of the medieval city and intentionally placed his easel at strategic locations that allowed him to capture these areas before they disappeared forever. The churches of S. Tommaso and S. Maria in Campidoglio, for example, appear in multiple compositions, as do the famous oratory of S. Maria della Tromba and the Fish Loggia that now stands in the eastern portion of the city: all of these formed important monumental landmarks in the Mercato Vecchio that were earmarked for destruction or removal in the 1880s. Buildings that featured prominently in his paintings include palaces once owned and occupied by famous protagonists of the Renaissance, as well as major ecclesiastical institutions once packed with art works that, then as well as now, are considered to be major monuments of western culture. Indeed, despite the presence of miniscule figures who sit, stand, and walk about in the spaces he creates, Borbottoni’s subject matter revolved primarily around the built environment rather than the people who occupied it: those figures appearing in his paintings serve only as scale measurements to help viewers understand the dimensions of the structures in each painting. Borbottoni knew that the design sensibility of the medieval city, still visible to him at the end of the nineteenth century, was doomed to oblivion. He took great pains to capture the earth tones of exterior walls, the marble balustrades on staircases leading to main portals, and the colorful fabrics that sometimes hung from windows or niches of buildings. The dusty roads of the center that he painted often jar with the tram lines that supplanted the city walls, reputedly designed and constructed under the supervision of Arnolfo di Cambio. And the bridges that connect the ancient Roman urban core to the north of the city with the medieval and early modern structures in the Oltr’Arno to the south were carefully studied and reproduced – and thankfully so, as these paintings became important documents during their reconstruction after their demolition by Nazi forces in the summer of 1944. Still, the painter’s vision of his city was not completely accurate. Borbottoni often took liberties with the actual appearance of the spaces he reproduced in paint. Two versions of the famous Piazza della Signoria, for example, offer divergent heights of the same buildings, suggesting that the Railway officer took some artistic license when his compositions demanded some assistance. He romanticized a number of his landscape vistas, turning the run-down Zecca Vecchia and the deeply problematic Debtor’s Prison (called the Stinche) into a lovely vestiges of the medieval past, and the dank, dark, and dangerous Jewish Ghetto as an antiseptically clean and enticingly attractive neighborhood fit for any upstanding bourgeois homeowner. The few figures that appear in these visions make the city seem open, airy, and relaxed, when in fact Florence had already become a tourist attraction and bustling urban center in the middle of the economically thriving province of Tuscany. Indeed, Florence had served as the first capital city of the new Italian Republic from 1865 to 1870, and all the benefits that had come to it with this important status made it one of the country’s wealthiest and most modern cities. Fabio Borbottoni was a one-man Office of Tourism who nostalgically exaggerated the features of his home town in order to celebrate a notion of a city that didn’t really exist, all the while lamenting the gradual demolition of the urban environment that was happening before his eyes during the decades of the 1880s and 1890s. Fabio Borbottoni was not a great painter by contemporary standards. He offered no new way of seeing his world, suggested no actual opinion on the very real issue of urban renewal in a city with a storied past, and sought neither fame nor fortune with the works he produced. But Borbottoni, along with the contemporary critic and Historian Guido Carocci, performed the important task of preserving for posterity the appearance of Florence as it appeared before the violent and permanent reconfigurations of individual structures, entire neighborhoods, and city-wide traffic patterns – albeit with a keenly apologetic and subjectively promotional eye. To them we are indebted for their staunch support of Florentine history, the physical spaces in which so many important events transpired, and the socio-cultural environment in which was born the Italian Renaissance of the fifteenth century. But of them we also must question the accuracy of their representations, the motives behind their nostalgic romanticism, and the veracity of their vision of the old city.",

        "content"  : "Ferdinando del Migliore Ferdinando del Migliore was born in 1628 and spent his adult life researching and writing about the history of Florence. A gifted archivist, del Migliore scoured the registers and contracts of individuals and institutions in an effort to present to his readers accurate accounts of the city’s past. In 1684 the noted historian published his most important book, Firenze città nobilissima illustrata da Ferdinando del Migliore, in which the author recreated the ancient city by examining its buildings, one by one. Using documents as the foundation of his argument, del Migliore refuted legends and hearsay that had been propagated over time and corrected them by publishing the writings he uncovered. His single volume account of Florence’s history was the model for later projects, most notably Giuseppe Richa’s multi-tome Notizie istoriche delle chiese fiorentine divise ne’ suoi quartieri, a vast eighteenth-century review of the city’s churches that depended heavily on del Migliore’s groundbreaking work. Modern readers of del Migliore’s text value his contributions mostly for the way he employed documents in the examination of each specific building he considered, and his text is best consumed when one focuses on each chapter as a discrete unit, rather than on the entirety of the book as a holistic and complete account of the city. Indeed, his instincts as a student of the past caused him to compile information about major events and local characters, but because his book revolved around specific buildings he tended to discuss these people and actions piecemeal and only when they pertained to the institution under examination in that chapter. Readers rarely get a broad account of the city’s history or even an abbreviated timeline of the signature moments that influenced the lives and actions of its residents: this historian did not provide his readers with a chronologically oriented history of Florence. Instead, specific events and transactions pertinent to each edifice are served up as contextual explanations for that structure’s design and erection, independent of other events that transpired in the city at the same time. Del Migliore cut and pasted centuries’ worth of history into the individual studies of dozens of buildings, making it nearly impossible to understand the broad sweep of the city’s past. But it does present irrefutable evidence about the landmarks in the urban environment that shaped the way people moved, behaved, worshipped, loved, fought, and died for hundreds of years. Translating del Migliore Reading and translating del Migliore’s prose poses problems for modern interpreters. Writing in the style of the day, the seventeenth-century historian’s lengthy sentence structure often weaves multiple subjects into single passages, causing readers to untangle a variety of issues that have been wrapped up into one giant textual skein. Del Migliore turns phrases no longer in use, employs “creative spelling,” and sometimes refers to people, places, and things for which we have no reference today. And his bias for the city’s status in the history of western Europe sometimes blinds him to the importance of other places. We don’t write the way he did in 1684, and they didn’t read the same way we do today. Our team has worked to recast del Migliore’s text in a way that’s more palatable to contemporary readers. Lengthy sentences have been spliced into shorter ones, while unwieldy clauses have been truncated for the sake of clarity. Indeed, this translation is more of an attempt to reveal the sense of del Migliore’s approach than it is a strict and rigid replacement of English words for Italian ones. Still, we have worked hard to retain the spirit of his influential book and have been careful to include the archival information he provided in the original text as a basis for an understanding of each building that he discussed. All the facts remain; but the style of their presentation has been updated to a certain degree.",

        "content"  : "Gautier de Brienne: Duke of Athens Walter VI of Brienne (Gautier de Brienne), better known as the Duke of Athens, was a French nobleman invited to Florence in 1342 to help the Florentines defeat Pisa and gain possession of Lucca, a neighboring town. Described by the Florentine chronicler Giovanni Villani as cruel, cunning, avaricious, proud, and dictatorial, the duke was criticized by many for his tyrannical rule. In 1326, Walter first came to Florence to serve as the vicar of Charles, the Duke of Calabria, for several months. He returned in 1342 in the wake of unusual turmoil in the city following an economic crash, which was precipitated by King Edward defaulting on loan payments to Florentine banks funding his war against France. After leading the victorious fight against Pisa, Walter was offered the title of Capitano da Guerra. Walter persuaded the Florentines to increase their offer and, much to the chagrin of Guelf leaders, this savior of the city was appointed Podestà for life. Initially, the politically dominant patricians supported him and hoped that the Duke would preserve their power against pressures from the impotent magnate and working classes. But, when Walter instead provided greater rights and privileges to the city’s traditionally disenfranchised laboring classes, the upper guildsmen of Florence turned against their Podestà. Walter sought to equalize the tax burden and to recover communal rights and properties from the hands of the rich poplani grassi and magnate. He appointed special officials to do this and authorized them to keep a register in which were inscribed all of the commune’s property and rights (“bona et iura”). His policies, however, were more than an attempt to reform the state’s economy; they were intended to weaken the power and authority of the greater guildsmen. The last straw came on June 24, when Walter permitted a newly formed guild of unskilled wool workers to lead the annual parade on St. John’s Day, a symbolic gesture that infuriated Wool Guild officials. Walter now threatened the fragile social and economic equilibrium of guild leadership that had been carefully constructed over three generations. Stoked by a conspiracy that emanated from inside the Wool Guild, a mob surrounded the Palazzo Vecchio on Saint Anne’s Day, July 26, 1343. After a brief siege, the Florentines deposed Walter, forced him into exile, killed members of his French retinue, and ransacked their homes. Saint Anne’s Day was declared a public holiday and was honored for generations thereafter.

        "content"  : "Giottino (ca. 1324 - 1365) Giottino, also known as Giotto di Stefano, was born around 1324 and lived in Florence until his death in the 1360’s, although the exact year of his death is unknown. His father, Maestro Stefano Florentino, was a famous Florentine painter who gained painterly prominence for his naturalistic style, earning him the nickname the “Scimmia della Natura” (“Ape of Nature”). Giottino likely received painting instruction from his father, but looked strongly towards the great Giotto in the formation and development of his style. Much of Giottino’s written biographical history came from the writings of Vasari in his second writings titled Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects. Giottino’s best known works include the 1356 Madonna della Sagra, a fresco painted in a small niche carved into the side of a building in a poor district in Florence. The working-class audience in that neighborhood had complete access to this fresco and, unlike his other paintings, could see this image daily. Giottino’s Pietà, painted for the Church of San Remigo between 1360 and 1365, holds the crown as his best known individual work. The Pietà depicts a scene with twelve people surrounding the dead body of Christ, strewn across a small bedding with his feet on the left side of the image and his head on the right. Seven of the figures kneel around his dead body and offer prayers, while the other five remain standing and look towards Christ. A cross, centered and behind the figures, moves upward through the scene towards the top of the image and emanates to the left and right, adding balance and stillness to the image. Some of the figures in the image have been identified as the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalen, and other Saints, while also depicting two figures in modern attire who were likely the donors for the image. Giottino painted the Pietà in a highly naturalistic style, particularly for the 14th century. He appears to possess a rich understanding of the human body and how to portray it, and utilizes a naturalistic perspective and spacing between his figures. The gold background of Pietà underscores the scene’s holiness, while also serving to show the sanctity of the Church of San Remigo. The Pietà serves as an excellent example of Giottino’s great mastery of naturalism and perspective during his generation, strongly attributed to the influence of his father and Giotto. Although his work is often overlooked among the strong artistic innovations and creations of the Renaissance, Giotinno was recognized in his own time as a master of his craft. Giotinno was not able to live a full life, as he died in his late thirties or early forties from consumption, yet he still made an impressive mark on Trecento Florentine art.

        "content"  : "Giotto di Bondone (ca. 1265 – 1337) Few artists in the history of Western Civilization have received as much attention and adulation as Giotto di Bondone, a leading practitioner of a kind of pictorial representation that critics since the time of Giorgio Vasari have credited with initiating a New Style of Art that we now associate with the period we call the “Renaissance.” Legends surrounding his genius cropped up during his lifetime, and the productivity of his large and active workshop – which extended from the university town of Padua in Northeast Italy all the way down to Naples in the southeast – both inspired generations of imitators and fooled the eyes of generations of critics that followed: as a result, the number of paintings ascribed to his hand is probably much larger than the actual number of images for which he was truly responsible. His origins, like those of most of his peers, can only be guessed at. Giotto appears to have been born in or around the year 1267, and he was certainly a contemporary of the famed poet, Dante Alighieri (who mentions him by name in Purgatorio XI: 91-96), the Sienese master Duccio di Buoninsegna, and the painter Cimabue, who Lorenzo Ghiberti and then Vasari claimed was his master. These two artists, Cimabue and Giotto, were linked together at the height of the latter’s career. As early as 1315, Dante celebrated them in a rather backwards way by using them as examples of the fleetingness of fame, when he famously wrote: O, empty glory of the powers of humans! How briefly does green endure upon the peak – Unless an age of dullness follows it. In painting, Cimabue thought he held The field, but now it’s Giotto they acclaim – The former only keeps a shadowed fame. The connection between Cimabue and Giotto was underscored in Ghiberti’s Commentarii of about 1450, in which the oft-repeated legend of the older artist’s discovery of the child prodigy – drawing a picture of a sheep on a rock – was first articulated. This initial comment on Giotto’s interest in using nature as a guide became the signature theme in Ghiberti’s biography of the painter. Wrote Ghiberti, Giotto was an enormously important figure in the field of painting. He brought forth to prominence the new art, abandoning the clumsiness of the Greeks. He made towering works of greatness, especially in the city of Florence (and in many other places) and collected disciples who were, in every way, the equal of the ancients. Indeed, one sees in Giotto’s art works that his followers could not better. He elevated nature in art, and with it a certain gentility, without ignoring proper proportions and measures. He was extremely skilled in all the arts, was an inventor and discoverer of many theories which had been buried for almost 600 years. When nature wanted to concede something, it conceded without a single complaint. Embedded in his lengthier biography of Giotto is Vasari’s terse remark that Giotto, “freed himself from the rude manner of the Greeks and brought back to life the true art of painting.” These legends and tropes do little to secure for us an authentic understanding of Giotto’s origins and early works. Some have connected him to the motherhouse of the Franciscan Order in Assisi and have argued that he was the sole creator of a series of frescoes (produced in the 1290s) in the upper basilica that illustrate scenes from the life of the thirteenth-century saint who started the order. Indeed, a document from the church of S. Francesco ambiguously places him there sometime before 1310, although it is unclear whether Giotto was then actively painting in the upper basilica or in the lower one directly beneath it. While most Anglo-American scholars reject the attribution of the St. Francis cycle to Giotto, believing them instead to have been painted either the so-called St. Cecilia Master or by Roman artists at the behest of the papacy (and Giotto’s work to have been confined to a single chapel in the lower basilica), the possibility of his activity in upper church of Assisi is still celebrated by Italian scholars – and by the friars who still live and work in the cloister there. By 1300 he appears to have been in Rome, where Giotto is said to have produced for Pope Boniface VIII a massive mosaic dedicated to the Navicella that graced the façade of Old St. Peter’s basilica until its destruction in the early sixteenth century. As is the case with Giotto’s other works from this early moment in his career, the Roman project is not documented. The first time Giotto’s name appears in a written record comes in 1305, when the painter was mentioned working for Enrico Scrovegni in the Paduan chapel that bears the banker’s name. Responsible for both the architectural design of that private oratory and the frescoes painted within it, Giotto efficiently completed this project in roughly two years. The so-called Arena Chapel was dedicated on the Feast of the Annunciation, March 25, 1306, and the doors of the space were opened to the public annually on that date to commemorate his achievement. Among those who almost surely saw and marveled at the paintings Giotto produced there was the Florentine exile Dante Alighieri, by then a resident of Padua on the verge of penning one of the most influential works of literature in all of human history. Dante’s conception of Hell in the Inferno (initiated around 1307) seems to rely quite heavily on the zones of the damned and the grouping of punishments that appear in the imagined cauldron of Giotto’s Last Judgment and the damaged souls inside it that the artist painted only a few months before Dante began writing his verses. Giotto then made his way to Assisi, where he oversaw frescoes in the lower basilica of S. Francesco before finally making his way back to Florence – a city he had assiduously avoided for most of the duration of the quasi-civil war there that lasted for nearly all of the first decade of the fourteenth century. By 1312 he had finished an impressive crucifix for the Dominicans at S. Maria Novella that served as a model for younger artists producing similar paintings for the remainder of the Trecento. In 1317, he began a lengthy project to fresco the walls of the Bardi Chapel along the right transept of the Franciscan church of S. Croce, with scenes from the life of St. Francis of Assisi. Just before leaving for Naples in 1328, where Giotto worked for five years as the court artist of Robert of Anjou, his workshop completed frescoes that illustrated the miracles of St. John the Evangelist and St. John the Baptist in the Peruzzi Chapel, adjacent to the aforementioned Bardi Chapel. The altarpiece of the Coronation of the Virgin was probably completed at roughly the same time, that is sometime around 1328, and has much in common with the hotly contested double-sided altarpiece that Cardinal Jacopo Stefaneschi commissioned from Giotto and placed in the canon’s choir of Old St. Peter’s basilica in Rome either in 1300 or in 1329. Take your pick. Giotto’s work in Naples comes down to us only in the form of notices and vague archival references. The elderly artist, then in his sixties, may have painted some works for the Angevin king there, but whatever he completed was ruined by a series of earthquakes that had, by the end of the eighteenth century, utterly leveled almost the entire medieval city (and most of the artistic works that once shined inside it). By 1333 Giotto was back in Florence, now feted as the official City Artist despite his advanced age. Indeed, the artist seems to have received his appointment from the city at precisely the moment of his retirement. Giotto managed to set down designs for the Campanile that stands next to the cathedral’s façade, but those designs were so poorly executed that the project was halted and re-configured out of fear that Giotto’s building would completely collapse. Other than the Campanile project, Giotto pursued practically no other commissions during this final stage of his career, and it may well be that his post a City Artist was actually an administrative post (or, just as likely, merely an honorific title), and that his real job was to delegate (or even sub-contract) important commissions to younger artists like Bernardo Daddi and Andrea Pisano. Yet Giotto’s legacy cannot be exaggerated. His approach to naturalistic figures and believable narratives catapulted Florentine art from the stodgy and predictable effigies painted by thirteenth-century artisans, deeply wedded to elongated and stylized Byzantine traditions, to a vibrant and animated visual environment that valued energy, emotional content, and gestural drama. His conveyance of mystical sublimity in The Stigmatization of St. Francis at the top of the Bardi Chapel, for example, succeeds due to the recognizable anatomical form that emerges from underneath Francis’ garment and the unrelenting facial expression of the elderly friar confronting his God. The emotionally fraught image of Francis’s followers who mourn his death in the Burial of St. Francis inside the chapel counters this image by placing around the dead saint a collection of tormented men, each one lost in his own psychological state of grief and each one contributing to the broader emotional environment created by this Greek Chorus of unified anguish, all of which has been depicted through the furrowed brows and downturned lips and thrusting hands of otherwise anonymous clerics. No one had ever seen paintings quite like this before, and their impact was immediate and pervasive, as evidenced by the legion of imitators who strove to echo his new approach to pictorial naturalism. Giotto’s innovative spirit captured the imagination of writers during and after his lifetime. Boccaccio famously cast Giotto in a number of his tales in the Decameron from ca. 1351, making the painter out to be a sage judge of character. Francesco Sacchetti’s Trecento Novelle from the 1390s expanded on this literary trope by ascribing to Giotto a certain wit and wisdom that put the craftsman on par with Florence’s greatest minds. And Vasari’s sixteenth-century story of “Giotto’s O,” a play on Pliny the Elder’s tales (concerning the Greek painters Apelles, Parahaxios, and Protogenes) in which the artist drew a perfect circle – free hand – before an uncomprehending papal lackey, came to be seen by modern painters (like Rembrandt van Rijn) as the perfect allegory of artistic dexterity. To this day, Giotto receives a kind of adulation among Italian art lovers as a groundbreaker among groundbreakers, the first of the painterly Evangelists who, along with Masaccio, Leonardo, and Michelangelo, proselytized a new approach to the visual arts. Importantly, some of Giotto’s stylistic and intellectual innovations were disseminated even before his death. His talented workshop almost certainly included Taddeo Gaddi and Maso di Banco, two of the most gifted painters of the fourteenth century who gained their independence and produced important works of their own as soon as Giotto left for Naples in 1328. In fact, many of the figures and scenes credited to Giotto’s hand in the 1310s and ’20s were, in all probability, actually executed by these great masters-in-training, thanks to the tradition of workshop production that dictated a delegation of productivity among assistants on the scaffold. But even painters who did train directly with Giotto looked to his art for inspiration. Pacino di Buonaguida and Bernardo Daddi, excellent painters in their own right, quoted the details of Giotto’s passages with frequency and skill, even though they appear to have come from different pictorial traditions. Even after the passing of the Black Death in 1348 - a watershed event that, at least chronologically (if not psychologically), divides the late Middle Ages from the early Modern period - Giotto’s compositions, figures, gestures, and narrative solutions still held sway among painters like Andrea Orcagna and Nardo di Cione, Niccolò di Pietro Gerini, and even Lorenzo Monaco into the fifteenth century. Only with the advent of Masaccio, the first painter of the Quattrocento to truly understand Giotto and his approach to naturalistic representation, did artists begin to build upon the traditions he had founded in the early Trecento.

        "content"  : "Giovanni Boccaccio (1313-1375) Long considered one of the “three crowns” of Italian medieval writers (along with Dante and Petrarch), Giovanni Boccaccio left in his wake stories of all kinds. Born in 1313 as an illegitimate child of a merchant, Boccaccio first studied economics and trade in Naples before attempting a legal career. When he reached maturity he scorned his father’s wishes and pursued a career in literature. Unlike other authors of the day, Boccaccio strayed from emulating the poetics of Virgil and Homer and turned instead to the prose of Ovid, who was considered a more lowbrow author. An astute reader and noted scholar, Boccaccio famously performed public readings of Dante’s Divine Comedy on the steps of the Badia, the Benedictine Abbey that faces the Bargello, and historians believe his decision to write in vernacular Italian arose from Dante’s efforts to write poetry in the common tongue. He expanded directly on Dante’s compositions and became close friends with Petrarch despite their conflicting literary topics and styles. The Decameron, Boccaccio’s best-known work, is a collection of one hundred tales told by ten people over ten days. Sequestered in a country palace after the outbreak of plague in 1348, seven women and three men entertain each other by telling instructive and often scandalous stories of love, religion, money, crime, and justice. As the Black Death destroys the city’s everyday rhythms, these elite men and women lampoon Florence’s social norms, politics, and church practices in a space both physically and mentally removed from the city itself. In writing both female and male narrators into The Decameron, Boccaccio creates a new kind of communal space distinct from normal Florentine contexts. The erotic nature of some of these stories – as well as the number of female narrators in his book – suggests that Boccaccio wrote mainly for a female audience. The book became an instant success for its commentary on human life in the face of tragedy. Yet Boccaccio’s parody of longstanding institutions did not go unnoticed. The Index of Prohibited Books, created in 1559 as a tool for the Catholic Counter-Reformation, listed The Decameron as one of its forbidden texts, and even into the twentieth century it was known as “The Dirty Stories.” The Decameron and Boccaccio’s other works serve as some of the most valuable (and candid) primary sources about the average Florentine’s engagement with the city’s various civic, religious, and social spaces. Scholars, authors, and artists referred not only to ancient sources but also to contemporary texts from Italy and Europe. This mixing of traditions demonstrates a consistent transformation of Florentine writing rather than a linear evolution. Boccaccio’s pivotal work provided different ways to read and understand Florence as a medieval city, both through its narrators and its characters. Boccaccio died in 1375 at the age of 62, but not without regrets. In his last years, the writer penned letters to his friend Francesco Petrarch in which he lamented the bawdiness of some of the themes in his Decameron. Those who have enjoyed his tales since their publication have not shared Boccaccio’s concerns. Bibliography Boccaccio, Giovanni. The Decameron. New York: Oxford World’s Classics, 2008.

        "content"  : "Maso di Banco (ca. 1305 – ca. 1350) Though he only worked for a short period in the first half of the 14th century, Maso di Banco is considered one of the greatest students of Giotto. Despite his illustrious teacher and accomplished personal career, almost no information remains about his life. Though it is known that he worked in Florence circa 1330-1350, none of his work was ever signed or dated, a fact which has furthered the mystery surrounding his brief career. The frescoes of the Bardi di Vernio Chapel in the Franciscan friary of S. Croce are the only works attributed to him without question, a tradition informed by Ghiberti’s early writings that describe Maso’s impressive skill as both a painter and sculptor, and attribute the frescoes of the chapel to him. The frescoes primarily depict scenes from the Life of St. Sylvester, but also include images of the Resurrection of Christ and the Last Judgment. The Life of St. Sylvester includes the prominent image of St. Sylvester and the Dragon on the south wall, a dramatic scene which exemplifies his clear style and illustrates the direct influence of Giotto. Both painters used a similar palette of pinks, greys, reds, and whites, as well as light and dark contrasts to convey a sense of naturalism. The legacy of Giotto can also be seen in Maso’s figures, which share the same individuality of expression. Credited with being more restrained and simpler that Giotto, Maso’s scenes dilute drama in favor of illusionistic depictions of deep space and connections to surrounding architecture. In creating these deep spaces, Maso places his figures in a way that helps suggest a certain kind of three dimensionality. These stylistic tendencies reappear in the fresco on the opposite wall of the Bardi di Vernio Chapel. In the image of the Resurrection on the north wall, Maso placed the painted figure of the Resurrected Christ rising up over a sculpted tomb, making it seem as though the event happens before our eyes. This blending of art and its setting allows for a consistent narrative, further fueling the story and the importance of its characters, which in turn enhances the holiness of the space. The little information we have about Maso includes the mention of him in guild records and registers, such as his matriculation into the Arte de’ Medici e Speziali guild in 1346 and the appearance of his name in the Register of the Compagnia di S. Luca in 1350. But there is no mention of him at any time after this. Given this lack of documentation, Maso di Banco’s legacy relies chiefly on Ghiberti’s accounts of his skill and range, his status as a pupil of Giotto, and most importantly his frescoes in the Bardi di Vernio Chapel.

        "content"  : "Nardo di Cione (died c. 1366) Nardo di Cione partnered with his brother, Andrea di Cione, to form one of the most successful and influential artistic workshops in post-plague Florence. Particularly gifted in the realm of fresco painting, Nardo’s works adorned a wide array of institutions across the city, and the famous letter of 1349 lists him (as well as his fraternal colleague) as one of the best painters working in Florence at the time. Most of Nardo’s life was lived in the parish of S. Michele Visdomini, the neighborhood abutting the cathedral to the north that was heavily populated by painters. But near the end of his life, Nardo moved closer to S. Maria Novella, at the city’s west end. He died there in 1365 and, like his older brother, he seems to have felt a spiritual tug that caused him to bequeath to the Company of the Misericordia a decent sum of money in his will, one of a number of documents pertaining to his life and legacy that have been discovered in the Florentine Archives. Nardo’s earliest works may have been produced in the nave of the Franciscan church of S. Croce, where Andrea di Cione appears to have led a large-scale project to paint a vast image of the Last Judgment on the south wall of the nave. He then seems to have worked inside the headquarters of the Arte della Lana, the Wool Guild, where we still see an image of the Judgment of Brutus that adorns the north wall of the Audience Hall. After surviving the Black Death of 1348, Nardo was engaged in the complicated fresco cycle of the Last Judgment in the recently constructed chapel in the transept of S. Maria Novella that was maintained by the Strozzi Family. He painted frescoes in the Bigallo as well, and even produced modestly-sized devotional triptychs for private viewers, like the one in Washington’s National Gallery, and altarpieces for local churches, like the Trinity and Madonna and Child Enthroned for the Chapterhouse of the Camaldolese monastery of S. Maria degli Angeli. Nardo’s stylistic approach matches that of his brother, Andrea. His proportionally accurate figures exert a kind of volumetric heft that’s articulated by subtle suggestions of light that move across draperies undulating over bodies. Facial features suggest stoic rigor, and often include furrowed brows and drooping lips surrounded by white whiskers. The throats of his male characters in particular often bulge with shaded muscles that converge in a V pattern around the Adam’s Apple. Nardo’s stylistic choices influenced generations of painters – including such popular figures as Niccolò di Pietro Gerini, Giovanni del Biondo, and his younger brother Jacopo di Cione. Even the florid brushwork of Lorenzo Monaco, the great painter of the early fifteenth century, can be considered as a form of dialogue with the approaches taken by Nardo di Cione. Bracketed by the sparkling innovative spirit of Giotto and the equally transformative approach of Masaccio, Nardo di Cione and his mid-fourteenth-century peers often get overlooked when considering the grand sweep of Italian art in the early Renaissance period. But his adoption of the tenets of the older artist, combined with his own nuanced sense of spiritual rigor, formed a transitional bridge between the early fourteenth century and the fifteenth in ways that cannot be over-emphasized. He’s truly one of the great painters of the Florentine Trecento. Bibliography Becherucci, Luisa and Giulia Brunetti. Il Museo dell’Opera del Duomo di Firenze I and II (Milan and Florence, 1969-70).

        "content"  : "Niccolo Gerini (ca. 1340–1416) Niccolò di Pietro Gerini is not a household name today. His conservative style extended the innovations of Giotto and the traditions of Bernardo Daddi, but a full century after the advent of this new style of painting reached the vantage point of Florentine viewers. However, at the height of his career at the turn of the fifteenth century, few painters in Tuscany enjoyed the kind of popularity that he did among patrons and audiences alike. We know nothing of his origins, his training, or his demeanor, but the archives do tell us that both his father and his son were also painters. It stands to reason that the family members worked together as a team for over one hundred years. For his part, Niccolò matriculated into the Guild of Doctors and Apothecaries in 1368 at a time when he was involved in collaboration with Jacopo di Cione to paint now-lost frescoes in the vaults of the residence hall of the Florentine Guild of Lawyers, Judges, and Notaries. He may also have assisted on two additional works completed by Jacopo – the two Coronations of the Virgin for S. Pier Maggiore and the Florentine Mint, respectively – but the “Niccolaio” listed in documents related to these commissions may instead refer to the painter Niccolò di Tommaso. He painted a large dossal of the Entombment of Christ currently in the oratory of S. Carlino, just across the street from the more famous guild church of Orsanmichele. He teamed with Ambrogio di Baldese in 1386 to paint the fresco of the Abandonment and Restitution of Children on the façade of the Bigallo, and two years later completed a beautiful triptych of the Baptism of Christ for an altar in the dormitory of the Camaldolese monastery of S. Maria degli Angeli. Soon thereafter he went to the nearby town of Prato to paint frescoes in the Palazzo Datini and the church of S. Francesco, and then worked in Pisa at the church of S. Francesco before returning to Florence to paint the frescoes in the Sacristy of S. Croce. Two haunting paintings of the Man of Sorrows – one for the Flagellant Confraternity of Gesù Pellegrino that operated out of S. Maria Novella and the other for an unknown setting – remind us of the severity of devotional practices during the decades following the Black Death of 1348 and its periodic reappearances. A number of other paintings have been attributed to his hand, like two street tabernacles that still stand on the Via dei Malcontenti and the Via delle Bella Donne, but this is speculative. However, documents from Orsanmichele confirm that in 1409 Niccolò di Pietro Gerini painted in fresco the effigies of a number of guild patron saints that still adorn the columns inside the former grain repository today. Gerini’s approach to painting clearly demonstrates an affinity for the rather hard and massive forms popularized by Andrea Orcagna di Cione and his brother, Nardo di Cione, both of whom followed closely the traditions formulated by their probable master, Bernardo Daddi. Gerini’s lively compositions often revolved around narrative themes, sometimes invented from whole cloth by the artist: the Abandonment and Restitution of Children on the Bigallo and the Man of Sorrows in S. Maria Novella include references to contemporary people and practices that the artist either witnessed for himself or imagined in the design phase of the process. His color palette, filled with rich blues, greens, and vermilions, creates decorative patterns of unusual complexity and aesthetic brilliance. But his adherence to traditional representations of space, generic renderings of anatomical forms, and time-tested religious iconography make his impact on contemporaries and later generations minimal at best. Indeed, the advent of Lorenzo Monaco in the early fifteenth century and the arrival on the scene of Masaccio in 1422 swayed other Florentine painters away from Niccolò’s precedents, even though both Lorenzo and (to a lesser degree) Masaccio owed Gerini some important artistic debts. But for an important chunk of time between about 1380 and about 1405, Niccolò di Pietro Gerini was a leading artist in a city filled with capable competitors.

        "content"  : "Taddeo Gaddi (ca. 1290-1366) Taddeo Gaddi, born circa 1290, is often described as one of the most talented artists and builders living in Florence during the medieval era. Heralded as one of Giotto’s most able pupils, Gaddi exuded a reverence for his master’s stylistic technique and sought to follow the artistic method of his teacher. Sometimes this resulted in a kind of imitative quality that caused Giorgio Vasari to comment harshly on Gaddi’s aping of Giotto’s aesthetic, stating “(Gaddi) always continued Giotto’s manner without improving it,” a backwards compliment that suggests a slavish imitation on the part of Taddeo Gaddi. Despite working in the shadow of his famous master, Gaddi enjoyed a successful career in art, opening his own shop and receiving some of the most lucrative commissions in all of Florence. One such commission came from the Franciscan friary in the city, where Taddeo Gaddi was assigned as chief decorator for the group’s main worship center, the Basilica of Santa Croce. This ornate building contains important works by Gaddi, including his frescoes of the Tree of Life on the west wall of the conventual Refectory, quatrefoil panels of the Life of Francis that ornamented a large cabinet, and murals for the Cappella Baroncelli (1328-1330). Annunciation and visitation scenes align the altar walls of this latter space, and the large murals present themselves to viewers in grand fashion. Iconographically, these paintings are unmistakably evocative of Giotto’s work in the Arena Chapel at Padua (ca. 1305) and this imitation showcases Gaddi’s ceaseless reliance on his teacher as a fountain for inspiration. Despite Vasari’s critique, Gaddi did not merely imitate Giotto’s style, but managed to advance his master’s groundbreaking achievements: his ability to utilize natural light and rich hues to achieve perfect representations of color, seen in the Baroncelli Adoration of the Magi, displays Gaddi’s mastery of the color wheel that surpasses even that of Giotto’s. Until his death in 1366 Taddeo Gaddi was one of the most influential men in Florentine artistic culture. Despite being viewed as a simple follower of Giotto, Taddeo triumphantly surpassed his liege in the methodology of colors and light. His work in the Basilica Santa Croce provides a canonical viewing of Gaddi’s copycat style while also underscoring his heightened proficiency with color.

        "content"  : "Loggia Leonardo Bartolini, et.al., Loggia, 1355-1363 On January 21, 1355 (1354 o.s.) the company received a gift of territory – about twenty feet (“ten braccie”) – on the corner of the Piazza S. Giovanni, which they used to site construction of the open loggia that soon came to be recognized as a signature feature of the Florentine cityscape. Eight years later, a workman named Ambrogio was paid for designing, casting, and installing the intricate iron lattice work the hugs the contours of the porch and that appears to have completed the architectural project. The arches and walls bear images that mark the structure as an edifice of importance in the civic fabric of Florence. [Read More] In 1321, a wealthy magnate named Baldinaccio Adimari gifted property that he owned in his family’s neighborhood to a newly formed charitable organization charged with the tasks of tending to the destitute, diseased, and disenfranchised. The building there housed the Misericordia from that time forward but, thanks to a series of additional gifts from neighbors, the company was able to expand its residence to the east and the west. Giovanni degli Albizzi Pellegrini, a member of one of the city’s most powerful families, donated property adjacent to the original building in 1351, and in 1355 the addition of the twenty feet at the corner of the Corso Adimari provided the company with the area needed for the loggia that now extended to the east. From 1355 to 1360, a man named Leonardo Bartolini oversaw the construction of this loggia, which included work completed by a number of skilled laborers he subcontracted to produce details according to their areas of expertise: One Francesco Salvini received 13 gold florins for undisclosed work, while a painter named Bartolommeo earned the equivalent of 21 gold florins for his decoration of the top of the oratory – presumably its ceiling, but perhaps the walls of the upper floor of the residence. In 1363 the project was deemed complete when the so-called Ambrogio installed elaborate decorative ironwork, priced at 100 florins (but no more than that!), on the loggia’s western and northern arches. Although more modest in scale than some of Florence’s other loggias, the intimate proportions and delicate decorations of this elegant monument make the Misericordia’s structure one of the most beautiful in the city. Ambrogio’s iron grill alone distinguishes it from other such edifices in Florence, but it’s easy to overlook it when taking in the entirety of the building for the first time. The marble exterior forms two sides of the loggia’s square box, with openings on the east and north sides providing visual access to the interior. Green marble, a decorative motif borrowed from the eleventh-century facings of the Baptistery and S. Miniato, provides a subtle articulation that frames the two arches, their pendentives, and the horizontal borders at the top and bottom. Column clusters form the discrete sections of each pier and serve as supports for the loggia’s arches, and then spring upward toward the quadripartite vault that flowers into porch’s ceiling. Twisting columns, perhaps allusions to the spiral ones said to have once adorned the interior of King Solomon’s temple in Jerusalem, create the illusion of movement as one’s eye moves toward the interior. Foliage and rosette patterns dance across the surface of the entire white marble structure, making the loggia appear as an avant-garde welcoming center to all comers. This sense is only intensified by the figurative sculptures that decorate the façade. Within the green strips that create sections across the loggia’s surface appear a series of modest bas-reliefs – perhaps carved by Arnolfo Arnoldi, under the influence of Andrea Pisano – that contain in them a set of undifferentiated heavenly figures who tilt their heads back to consider images of Christ at the apex of each arch. The quatrefoil frames on the east arch contain scroll-bearing prophets from the Old Testament who flank the half-length form of the Dead Christ – the so-called Man of Sorrows – while those on the north arch feature saints from the New Testament and the Early Christian church who receive a blessing from an image of the Resurrected Christ above them. Representatives from both books of the Bible here recognize Jesus as Savior. Triangular spandrels on either side of each arch contain half-length figures of the four Cardinal Virtues: Temperance and Prudence appear above the rounded vault on loggia’s the east side, while Justice and Fortitude decorate that on the north. These same characters appear in Nardo di Cione’s lunette fresco of The Judgment of Brutus from the middle of the 1340s that decorated the main room of the Florentine Wool Guild, just down the street, on the way to the Ponte Vecchio. The concepts that guide wise decisions and just behaviors in and in front of the Misericordia have been paired with Judeo-Christian heroes whose exemplary lives and influential texts combine to form the experiential and codified bases for fourteenth-century moral codes. The very form of the public loggia carried some symbolic importance in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Often installed for pragmatic purposes – namely to provide the public with a form of protection from soaking rains or the intense Italian sun – the loggia came to be understood as a civic structure that, even when built by private citizens, was a gift to the commune at large. For example, the Loggia dei Lenzi, situated adjacent to the Palazzo della Signoria, gave the governmental piazza an architectonic emblem of democracy, as its form, location, and function suggested an accessibility to literally anyone who wished to venture inside it. Giovanni Rucellai’s loggia, placed opposite his palace in the middle of the fifteenth century on the occasion of his son’s marriage to Cosimo de’Medici’s daughter, heightened the owner’s sense of self-importance as he simultaneously celebrated his prominence in the city as a Medici kinsman and his role as a public servant through this “donation” of an architectural structure to the residents of Florence. In keeping with this signification, the loggia for the Misericordia was both a symbol of the charitable nature of the institution – both the building and the services rendered inside it were gifts to the city – and a symbol of the company’s prominence in the urban environment – it was made of expensive materials, followed long-standing Florentine design traditions, and sat on prime real estate in one of the city’s most important squares. Early painters of Florentine cityscapes occasionally included representations of the loggia when producing vistas of the Piazza S. Giovanni, although their renditions differed from artist to artist and from painting to painting. The building features prominently in the fresco by Niccolò di Pietro Gerini and Ambrogio di Baldese that originally decorated the façade of the residence hall that faced the Baptistery, and portrayed its appearance with impressive accuracy. These artists included in their painting of 1386 the column clusters, iron grates, spandrel figures, and the rosette decoration that forms the left side of the loggia’s entrance that mark it as such a remarkable space, suggesting that the building’s details truly mattered to both the fresco’s painters and its audience. Ridolfo Ghirlandaio, by contrast, painted in 1515 a much more simplified version of the space in his predella for the Bigallo altarpiece (with figures by Alberto Arnoldi installed in 1364): the sixteenth-century artist emphasized rectilinear pilasters (rather than sculpted column clusters and spiral colonnettes) as supports for the arches, avoided the articulation of each bas-relief, and omitted the figures of the Cardinal Virtues that were sculpted in the spandrels. Even though he truncated the residence in his painting – he shows only two arched bays on the north façade instead of three – he was careful to include iron bars within the archway and the rosette plinth at its base. The late sixteenth-century aerial view of Piazza S. Giovanni by either Giorgio Vasari or the Flemish painter Jan van der Straet (a.k.a. Giovanni Stradano, a.k.a. Johannes Stradanus, d. 1605) references the loggia only through the pictorial employment of rounded arches that mark the facility as distinct from those around it, but then fails entirely to capture even a semblance of its actual appearance beyond these obvious rounded vaults. Fabio Borbottoni (d. 1902) reproduced the loggia’s architectural features with some accuracy when he painted his version in the late nineteenth century, but he omitted completely the sculptural elements embedded in the archways: it’s as though they were never installed on the building’s façade at all.

        "content"  : "Mark Rosen University of Texas at Dallas Don Stefano Buonsignori: A Brief Biography Until recently, little was known about the life of the cartographer behind the spectacular 1584 view of Florence. Unlike many of the great late-sixteenth century cartographers, he wrote no scientific treatises, did little to publicize his own work, and never forged lasting links to local artistic and printmaking communities. The entirety of his known output was produced under the patronage of Grand Duke Francesco I de’ Medici (ruled 1574–1587), best remembered as the patron of the Palazzo Vecchio Studiolo as well as his ill-fated second marriage to Bianca Cappello. A handful of scientific instruments—a quadrant, four polyhedral sundials, and a four-bowl Scaphe dial—in the Museo Galileo in Florence are Buonsignori’s only known objects besides his maps. Buonsignori began work for Francesco as a replacement for the brilliant polymath Egnazio Danti, a favorite of Francesco’s father Cosimo I. In addition to publishing a dozen technical treatises and occupying a prestigious chair in mathematics at the University of Florence, Danti had steadily worked on a cycle of painted maps for a new space in the Palazzo Vecchio, the Guardaroba Medicea. Working slowly, Danti had completed 30 by 1575. For unclear reasons, Francesco fired Danti late that year and immediately installed Buonsignori to complete the space’s decoration with 23 additional maps, which he finished around 1586. Before being brought into grand-ducal employment, Buonsignori was not known as a cartographer. His entire career, in fact, had been in religious service and administration for the Olivetan order, to which he was initiated in 1541. The Olivetans were a Tuscan-based offshoot of the Benedictine order, with their large mother church, Monte Oliveto Maggiore, located in the Sienese foothills. The order had two major church compounds in Florence: San Miniato al Monte, the famed Romanesque church and cloister facing the city from a hilltop southeast of the city center; and San Bartolomeo a Monte Uliveto, an Oltrarno complex situated in the hills above the San Frediano neighborhood. The self-portrait of Buonsignori holding a triangulation tool at the bottom of the view of Florence positions him very close by San Bartolomeo, which in fact was where he lived from 1576 until his death in 1589. Although no baptismal record has been found, Buonsignori was constantly identified in the order, and signed his maps, as Florentinus—a Florentine. Monks were usually initiated at the age of 18, meaning that he was probably in his early 60s when he made his bird’s-eye view of Florence. Because the Olivetans customarily asked monks to rotate from convent to convent (most of which were in Tuscany), Buonsignori had spent little of his adult life actually based in Florence before 1575. But when Grand Duke Francesco, pleased with Buonsignori’s works on the Guardaroba maps, entrusted him with the plan to create the first large-scale view of Florence since the Francesco Rosselli-designed View with a Chain from a century earlier, Buonsignori seized upon the opportunity. Beyond his Guardaroba maps, Francesco commissioned from Buonsignori two new maps of his territories, the Dominio Fiorentino and the Dominio Senese, both of which were printed in 1584 and circulated widely (the Fiorentino would appear in a number of editions of Ortelius’s atlas published after 1601). Those two maps, based on existing prototypes, were far less significant productions than the nine-sheet bird’s-eye view of Florence published the same year: Nova pulcherrimae civitatis Florentiae topographia accuratissime delineata. Buonsignori’s comprehensive 125 x 138 cm view was engraved in copper by the goldsmith Bonaventura Billocardo and contained a dedication praising not only the beauty of the city but also the beautification of it by Grand Duke Francesco and his ancestors. The legend identifies 225 buildings and monuments, far surpassing the detail of any previous map of the city. Buonsignori’s last major project was a small cycle of three frescoed wall maps for the Stanza delle Matematiche, a new room on the top floor of the recently completed Uffizi. Two of these frescoes, of the Tuscan and Sienese terriories, took as their foundation Buonsignori’s recently printed maps of those regions. A third map of the island of Elba rounded out the sequence. The painter Ludovico Buti translated Buonsignori’s designs to fresco in 1588–89, while Buonsignori applied the maps’ gold lettering himself. He died soon after and was buried in the church of San Michele e Gaetano in Florence’s Piazza Antinori.",

        "content"  : "Ferdinando Leopoldo del Migliore. Firenze: Città Nobilissima Illustrata (Arnaldo Forni: Florence, 1684). Oratory of the Old Company of the Misericordia and the Captains of the Bigallo In order to understand the origins of this place, it is necessary that we speak – neither to be harmful nor prejudicial in favor of the Republic – of the levels of religious division that caused so much of the turmoil that infected and stained the Florentines. The Manichean (Patarini) heresy, which insisted that God was not the Creator of all visible things, provoked the zeal of Catholics who wished to defend true faith, and the two sides came to do battle with each other; the latter won the conflict at S. Felicita, where today there is still a sign of that victory on a column. [76] Saint Peter Martyr, known in those days as Fra Pier da Verona and who had initiated that battle, wanted to take advantage of the victory even though the Inspector General in Tuscany had exhorted the Florentines to set aside their animosity. Every time the city fell sway to that heresy, the Catholics were ready, with valor and with arms, to exert force to correct the errors of their ways; in this way a number of leading citizens who represented the twelve standards of the city (the neighborhoods) and the standard of the red cross on the white field (the entire commune) were able to call upon the people to organize in neighborhoods and strike against the full-throated recklessness of the followers of this dangerous cause. Therefore these twelve, because they sought arms to deploy and lead the people into battle, were in need of help. The saint (Peter Martyr) appointed a Crusader knight named Bzovio, regarded by the city’s soldiers as their best fighter, as the Captain of the Counter Heretics. According to its Book of Entries 343, Volume 4, this group had originated in Florence under the direction of the celebrated Bu_satto with the help of the Inquisitors who fought heresy. It was supported in the time of Pope Innocent III, who came to power in 1198, and Pope Innocent IV gave it territories previously held by the Saracen King Saladin. Magri says that they wore a cross of velvet on their colorful hats that went from one side of the flap to the other, just like those worn by Greek clerics. But our knights, brave in battle against the infidel, went about in white clothes emblazoned with the red cross. Taking the sign of the cross, the captains who were appointed by Saint Peter Martyr and who had first led the confraternity of which we speak, first gave themselves the title of the Company of Saint Mary, and then changed it to the Misericordia, in order to perform pious works for which they later became famous. A great portion of Florentines, including both men and women, joined the group with particular devotion and stayed in the glorious city even after the death of their beloved founder, Saint Peter Martyr. Today we can find a book owned by the Bigallo in which are contained the first writings of the new institution, marked on the front page in large letters with words commonly seen in the time, “In the name of our father, Jesus Christ, and the holiest pure saint, the Holy Mother Mary, Queen of Heaven and Woman of the World. In this book are written the names of the women of the quarter of San Giovanni and the area, who joined this Company of the Glorious Virgin Mary, patron of the city of Florence, [77] which was formed by the beatified martyr Saint Peter of the Order of Preachers in the year of our Lord Jesus Christ’s Incarnation 1260, on the feast of the Ascension of Christ.” It is important to note that the participants took this book seriously, for a number of corrections were made in the original text; and like a reliquary, the manuscript’s contents of important names of ancient families who were zealous defenders of the Catholic faith looks like scripture, and its authenticity shows the glory of Saint Peter Martyr’s endeavor in Florence. To fail to credit its authors is to deny them the strength of their faith. This book also corroborates a story told by some about an old painting that was once next to the portal of the Residence of the Captains of Orsanmichele which depicted Saint Peter holding in his hand the banner that he carried into battle against the abovementioned heretics, and which is today preserved alongside other relics in the sacristy of S. Maria Novella and exhibited to the people each year on his feast day. Many hospitals were founded by the company, first by its soldiers and then by the confraternity of the Misericordia. The first of these was called S. Maria del Bigallo, located at a spot called Fontana Viva some five miles outside the city of Florence. This was the home of the nuns of Ripoli who, on 5 April 1267, signed a solemn contract with Ser Baldovino Ruffoli and the captains to accept his donation of funds to form the hospital that still goes by the name Bigallo. The nuns were received in this place, which is part of S. Domenico, and the edifice was built by a person famous named Buonaguida del Dado, known to have been part of the ancient Lamberti family. They went on to build other celebrated hospitals that some uneducated people don’t fully appreciate. In 1503 the captains ceded the Bigallo completely to the nuns, where they are to this day and are celebrated annually by the laity who present them with gifts of wax. Because everyone is curious about the origins of the name, here’s why it’s called the Bigallo and the significance of that name. Because one wants to speak twice of the rooster [“gallo”], the first letter B stands for “Bi” (two) or “Bis” (another): Bi-gallo, then, means Two Roosters. [78] Before passing over this, we must speak briefly of the other twelve hospitals under their care that were divided between two separate organizations: the first was called S. Maria del Bigallo (a.k.a. the company of S. Peter Martyr) and the other was called S. Maria della Misericordia, although both were governed by the same captains of the confraternity in Florence. This experiment lasted a long time, and with some success. But happily, in 1425 – at a time when the citizens of Florence were preoccupied with threats from outside their walls and disastrous wars threatened the state – the city fathers deliberated in the Senate and passed a law that united the two companies and formed a new entity with the name of S. Maria del Bigallo. Eight captains governed the company and placed on the façade of their residence hall their coat of arms, which was a shield divided vertically with, in one section, a red cross on a black field with the letter F, on another the letter M in a gold band, and on the third part a white rooster on a blue background with the letters S.M.B. underneath. There were other pious works performed in the old institution, among them the receipt of orphans abandoned by their parents and relatives. In an act of supreme humanity, and with loud voices praising the diligence of the Florentines to look out for each other, there was a move made to expand the building by about half its size. In a series of entries in its statute books, particularly in the section Rub. 157 vol. III, we read the following words: “Assigned to the company at Piazza Orsanmichele, vagrant boys and girls were to be cared for in the house of the Misericordia by official civic decree.” Those who did not abide by this were punished with the fury of the law and branded with reputations that made them out to be as bad as thieves. Not content to let degenerate parents get off with this simple stigma, writers of the time made sure to cite transgressions in their books, where they wrote, “haec tenet ambiguo Pueros errore vacantes, Nec pati pereat nescia turba laris, tuta sed hec fido maneant sub culmine donec reddantur Patribus pignora cara suis.” “Protected by the pledge of the trustworthy fathers who have promised to tend to them under this roof, children do not suffer the crowds or perish here, despite the errors of those who have left them with us, ignorant of the importance of the hearth, until that time when those children are returned to them.” Fra Mariano, who was mentioned in the book of the Works of M.S. ___ in the library of the church of the Ognissanti in Florence, described its role as an orphanage as one of the charities that defined the devotion of Tuscans. This occurred during the time of the Principate, following the exercises undertaken by the magistrate of that time who was listening to the advice given to him by Pope Paul III Farnese. In 1541 Paul had to balance the wishes of his cardinals and Florentine citizens, and had a bull written to create a company that would count the number of abandoned children admitted into the Bigallo. He got Grand Duke Cosimo I to support it, and filled with good intentions, they were seen carrying [79] a sign of blessing to their subjects, sincerely applying his benedictions to those who were afflicted by the famine in that time, one of the worst in that period, which devastated the poor of Florence (but was not as bad as we endured during our battle of Tuscany). He ordered that the Orphanage of S. Caterina, in which were housed abandoned boys and girls (as we have seen), receive the patronage that was bestowed upon it by the pope on 8 July 1543 so that the children could live a decent and comfortable life. The year before, on 26 June (1542), the Grand Duke had declared that he, for the sake of the wellness of the orphans, would have the power to elect the captains of the Bigallo, which thus altered the general provisions that had been made for all the old hospitals in the past. These captains would receive the blessings of and privileges from the church, but they would be expected to conduct regular visits in return. The Archbishop Andrea Buondelmonte, on 17 October 1543, and the Cardinal Ridolfi, on 18 November, sanctioned this solemnly, as written and described by Ser Scipio Braccesi. Pope Sixtus V later celebrated this decision in a bull of 12 September 1587 which gave powers to those who founded a lay hospital like that of the Cavalieri di S. Stefano, that was neither for the sick nor for worship. After making this announcement, the first act of public possession and absolute control made by the magistrate was the decree of 1575, ordered by the chancellor and rectors of the commune who were waiting to visit the orphanages in order to obey the instructions they’d received from the government. As the pope had commanded that this position slowly transfer from ecclesiastical control to a secular authority the Grand Duke wanted to make it clear that thirteen gentlemen should form a body called by the ancient name of the Captains of the Bigallo and have officers called Head, Principle Director, and so on. A decree made by the supreme magistrate on 17 November 1542 reveals the selection of these captains by the archbishops, who hoped they would govern well because they had been appointed to their posts by members of the clergy and would observe the laws of God, difficult as it would have been for the captains to do so considering all the varying interests of people who were involved in the place and the judgments that had to be rendered over them. [80] He wanted, above all, to make sure that the authority to preside over all things civil – that is to say, criminal – would reside with the magistrates and not the clergy; this included the passing of inheritances to heirs, as one reads in the ninth book, rewritten on 119. The bull of Pope Paul III was executed by the government as a way to regulate priests and other clergy, depending on the hospital, and it imposed massive punishments on those ministers who disobeyed – like those refused to carry out the law of ’75 that required them to visit orphanages in the countryside. In a document of 14 January 1585, those who lived there were allowed attend a public audience each Tuesday where priests performed the mass and read passages requested by the laity. They say that Agnolo Marzi Medici, the bishop of Assisi who was the first to be elected and who was the first secretary of state for Grand Duke Cosimo I, used to come with Roccetto – with no intention of disrespect for the citizens there – to administer justice required at that site of the sacred cult. It’s good, then, that we see the following words above the door leading into the Audience hall (of the Bigallo), written in gold to commemorate the pope whose benefice left so much for them: “The most peaceful Grand Duke, Cosimo the Magnificent, of Tuscany XII. Man of great piety, administrative skill, and love of country.” Reinforcing this statement is the subtle figure painted in fresco at the door that represents the Allegory of Mercy adorned with a rich toga, a walking stick and a cloak that hangs from its shoulders. In roundels appear the seven works of the Misericordia; all of this appears in a state of devotion, as the governors of Florence stand with the people on bended knee to demonstrate that the piety of pilgrims triumphs over the power of the forum, armies, and even institutions, as the following words state: “These are the mercies performed in this place, done according to the merit of this company and according to the ideas of these pilgrims, in the year 1342, on the day of September___.” And above the big door where orphans are received, in the alcove that empties out onto the piazza, a similar fresco painting shows the way abandoned children used to be received, with some attention given to the different kinds of clothes worn by the pious. [81] There are also two other old stories, designed to show the concepts that have been described in this book, specifically the two principal acts performed in Florence by Saint Peter Martyr. The first shows the Saint giving the white banner, decorated with the red cross, to the twelve knights of this institution who, as we have said above, fought against the heresy of the Patarini. With great attention paid to their attire, with the red togas the likes of which are rarely seen elsewhere soppanante di Vaii co’ Maniconi larghi alla Ducale, worn they say by those ancient kings of the gold apron, they show the proper attitude in this singular picture. In the other painting appears the Devil in the form of a black horse charging toward the people in the Mercato Vecchio that confirms what is said about the saint’s life by his biographers. There we have the different stories about the old Oratory of the Misericordia, located where there was once the Tower of the Guardamorto and the public room of the exhibition of the cadavers, commemorated above and in other places. These earlier structures were used by the Republic during the time of Saint Peter Martyr to house the knights, and although this cannot be confirmed in any texts (despite the researches conducted in old writings of the Chancellor), Ser Amideo da Falgano wrote that he was a captain in the building when it was first used as an oratory sometime around 1240. We cannot be sure of this date because it is not written down, as was customary at the time. The sculptures that we see ornamenting the façade, including the two Madonnas and a bas-relief at the top of the walled up door, were celebrated by Vasari as the work of Andrea Pisano, who did a good job imitating the style of the ancients. The other figures that comprise a group of marble figures on the altar, all in the round with two angels at the sides, have been inserted into a rich wooden frame to form three tabernacles. This is the work of Antonio, called Il Carota, an excellent master who did other works like this in intaglio. We can see inside them, at the base of the altar, pictures of certain little stories painted by Ridolfo Ghirlandaio, the son of Domenico, a famous painter of the age. And now we turn to the temple of S. Giovanni, located like an island in the middle of the Piazza.",

Name Also SS Giovanni e Miniato (1) Building History The Baptistery is still one of the greatest enigmas in the history of architecture. From the high middle ages to today, the Baptistery has served as a favorite subject of historical fascination for serious scholars. It has been dated in the fourth and fifth centuries, in the seventh and eighth, in eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth or even fifteenth centuries, so that its building history fluctuates throughout an entire millennium. During Dante’s time, the oldest dating was abandoned. Dante argued that the building was a creation of Roman antiquity, perhaps a temple of Mars (2). In my opinion, the still older dating in the third century of the early-Christian era needs to be abandoned (3). Lastly, the hypothesis of a Lombard-era origin is only contingently correct (4); Those other hypotheses of the foundation in the eleventh or twelfth centuries are also only conditionally plausible (5); the legends of significant (modifications) in the early Renaissance are completely wrong (6). I base my account on documents and the architectural remains, but these conclusions are speculative due to regrettably inconclusive excavations of the last half-century (7). The remains of three older cultural layers are located under the church. First, there are remains of a Roman palace that was probably established in the Augustan time and destroyed within Roman antiquity. Second, nested in the ruins of this palace, late-antique residential buildings and baths remain. At the end of the fourth century, this second layer was also destroyed. Graves of a Germanic cemetery dating to the early-middle ages occupy the most recent layer; one of these graves was partially destroyed with the installation of the left cornerstone of the apse of the Baptistery (8). Access to the digs: in the Apse. In 897, documents first mention a church of S. Giovanni located in the northeast corner of the Roman city wall, thus on high ground (9). It was again mentioned in in 909, 967, 990, and 1040 (10). Perhaps it was initially a Baptistery and Co-cathedral of St. Reparata; at the latest in the middle of the eleventh century, S. Giovanni ceased its original use as a cathedral and served as a baptismal church and as a home of the Cathedral canons. Maybe this shift was associated with the time when radical changes on the building were initiated. In 1059 or 1061 Pope Nicholas II, former bishop of Florence, likely performed a consecration in S. Giovanni, which was probably the cornerstone dedication for a monumental new building (12). The construction seems to have continued for a century. The first floor was largely finished by 1113, since Bishop Ranier, whose long governmental activity was closely linked with the first great progress of the new building (1077-1113), was buried in one of its walls (13). In 1117 the work was apparently still in progress, because the Pisans likely donated to the Florentines two columns, which then were erected in front of the Baptistery (14). In 1128 the ground floor was removed from the building (15). By 1150, and perhaps as early as 1128 (16), the design of the lantern concluded the construction of the dome and, therefore, the entire structure (17). Around this time, the cloth merchants guild began their control of the construction and the builders’ hut (18). Subsequently a few larger changes were undertaken on the finished church. In 1202 they replaced the half circle form of the Apse with an oblong choir chapel, the so-called “Scarsella” (19). Around 1207 the marble floor was initiated (20). In the second half of the 13th century the great dome gained its mosaic decoration (21). In the 1280s and 1290s, the Baptistery became the subject of a great architectural project for the last time, in connection with the redesign of the cathedral and cathedral square. In 1285 the city began to repave the square (22), and in 1293 or 1296, after removal of many funerary monuments, that had been embedded on the gray ashlar (Macigno), Arnolfo di Cambio encrusted external corner pillars of octagons with black-green and white marble coating. Through this massive renovation, he presumably wanted to match the Cathedral’s new façade with that of the Baptistery; he also apparently replaced the upper section of the foundation of the Baptistery (23). Since then, S. Giovanni has only been restored, though very frequently and drastically. In 1339 Florence cleaned the dirty marble floor and refaced the chief ornamental molding of the cornices (24). In 1341-1346, 1364, and 1389/90 repairs on the marble roof took place (25). In 1444-1471 the tile roof needed to be completely replaced again (26). Leonardo da Vinci wanted to lift the whole building into the air in order to place a base underneath (27). In 1515 a chain was embedded into the brickwork on top of the second cornice for structural reasons (28). In 1548 broad, not accurately defined restorations took place (29). Despite the violent protests of the citizens, in 1577 Buontalenti removed the medieval baptismal font and the accompanying canon’s chancel out of the church interior in order to create a place for a baptismal scene in honor of Don Filippo, the first-born son of Grand Duke Francesco I (30); this was the most severe mutilation the building ever suffered. In 1722 the canons erected a new choir screen in order to integrate a sacristy into the apse (31). Around 1782 the architect Giuseppe Manetti cleaned the building and rebuilt the base cornice (31). From 1895-1902 the stonework of the lantern, the “Tribuna”, and the east side of the octagon were dismantled and reassembled (33). At that time, and again in 1912/15, the baroque additions in the apse and on the altars were removed. In 1887 the northwestern half of the Piazza S. Giovanni was dug up, in 1895/97 the southwestern half, and in 1912/15 the various building layers under the western half of the church were uncovered (34). A full clarification of the building history can only be attained through research of the remaining, temporarily untouched site under the Baptistery and the plaza. Reconstruction of Lost Construction Stages The Lombard Construction: 7th and 8th Centuries Likely a rubble-stone octagon in accordance with the current exterior old town walls (35). Several things are unknown about the Lombard Construction: whether an apse with or without a crypt was present, where the apse or apses (perhaps four) would have been located if in existence, whether a cupola or open timber framing covered the room, and where the entrances were located (36). Original Condition of the Current Building The Corner Pillars. As on all the most important frame joints on other buildings of the Florentine incrustation style, the pillars of Macingo (i.e. gray ashlar) on the outside corners of the octagon existed until 1293/96 (37) (S. Miniato, S. Salvatore nell’ Arcivescovado, Badia Fiesolana). The ashlar cornice under the apse serves as a reminder of this phase today. Figurative reconstruction of the original conditions, the change of base, and other slight changes can be seen in retouched photography by Swoboda, “Kunstwissenschaftliche Forschungen”, II, 1933, Table 5 (and p. 64f.). The Tombs and Monuments. Until 1296 a circle of monuments existed against the outer wall, which partially consisted of antique sarcophaguses and medieval tombs (Avella) as on S. Maria Novella (38). The Apse. The apse was supported by the semicircular foundations under the current, square choir chapel. Today only the inner approaches in both westerly corners of the polygon are from these foundation walls. For the remaining parts, see the illustrations by Supino (Gli Albori, 1906, Tav. IV) and Galli (Riv. d’A. IX, 1916/18, page 82 and Fig. 13). The apse wall appears to have stood in loose association with the adjoining octagon wall inside and perhaps outside (39). A crypt was hardly in existence. It would have been tolerated poorly with the classical structure of the central room (40). The Apse was probably vaulted with a semi-dome and not incrusted (41). Baptismal Font and Choral Space. 1128 Removed in 1577, broken pieces rediscovered in 1905 (42). A uniform and magnificently marble-incrusted installation in the style of the correspondingly (probably copied but simpler) structure in the Pisan Baptistery (43). As the centerpiece, the baptismal font occupied the middle of the church interior, whose octagonal form is echoed in miniature. Its dimensions are indicated by the block-like foundation under the floor. It was adorned with rosette-filled coffers (presumably juxtaposed on each octagonal side as in Pisa). The rest of the ornamental panels are preserved in an Opera del Duomo warehouse, namely the larger coffer plates there. In four corners, small fountain-like chutes were attached, for the use of the baptizing Priest, like in Pisa (44). The actual baptismal font was enclosed by an octagonal gate, whose size is indicated through the undecorated surface in the middle of the Baptistery and also through the foundation walls, whose outline corresponds with it (45). Enclosed within the gates, the choral space was a rectangular, slightly-elevated area, that, in the width of the choir chapel, filled the space between this and the octagonal gates of the baptismal font, with the latter connected through a narrow passage (46). Remains of two sided colorfully-incrusted marble gates decorated with striking antiqued coffering were rediscovered in 1905 and were stored in a warehouse of the Opera del Duomo (47). In 1339 doors were attached on the canon chancel, and in 1341 as well as in 1458 grating was installed (48). The seating inside was renovated in 1466 by Andrea di Antonio di Geri (49). In 1577 Buontalenti planned a baroque chancel annex in the apse, to which the two spiral staircases ought to have led (50). In 1732 Girolamo Ticcaiati established a new, marble choir space in front of the apse. It is from a semicircular form around an elevated platform. Marble balustrade reliefs of the legend of John were installed on this platform (51). The structure was removed in 1912ff. – Floorplan from Abb. page 179 (left). The Stepped Foundation under the Church. It has never existed, as the excavations have proved. Similar to the theory of a Temple of Mars, its existence was bogus. The Circular Light-Opening in the Top of the Dome. Like the stepped foundation, this opening has never existed (53). Unsealed Outside Wall. Nonexistent. See the “Building History” and “Building Description” (54) Building Description Construction Records: The best by Milani, Annali dell’Ingegneria e d’ Architettura, 1918, 261-70 and by Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 118, 119, 129, 150. Also see Abb. on pg. 179, 186. — A list of older building records by Ferri, Indice, 1885, 38; The recordings are noteworthy from G.B. Nelli (18th Century) and from Giuliano da Sangallo (circa 1500) (55). The imprecise floor plans, cupola projection, usw. by Hübsch (Altchristliche Kirchen, 1862, Pl. XIX, 4), by Durm (Zeitschrift für Bauwesen, 1887, Taf. II), by Nardini (S. Giovanni, 1902, Fig. 17) and by Supino (Gli Albori, 1906, S. 45); compare to that the critique by Horn (Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 122, Note 8). Before the oldest building records, several painted depictions of the Baptistery emerged already in the 14th and 15th centuries. (56). The Basic Concept As the Florentine counterpart to the Pisan Cathedral and to the Church of St. Mark in Venice, the Baptistery is one of the greatest primary works of medieval architecture. It is essentially a standard creation of the late 11th and early 12th centuries. Its basic motive—an octagon with a choir chapel—has likely been copied from the predecessor of the current construction, the Lombard Baptistery. It would appear to be a late echo of the origins of the early Christian baptismal churches (57). The style, in which this motif was implemented, represents this fantastically and surprisingly successful attempt to build around the impoverished art world of the early Middle Ages a new world, that should allow the inherited talent of the Italian race to finally advance after long centuries of abstention. The ingenious architect, who laid the foundation of the Florentine and therefore of the new Italian and European architecture in general here, began as his contemporaries in Pisa and Venice with an appropriation of the achievements of the diverse architectural schools of the early Middle Ages in the Mediterranean region, and of the Byzantine, and created on this foundation an entirely novel design of the character of the High Middle Ages. Thereby he subdued the newly-won exuberance much more decisively than the other architects of the great coastal cities and refined the pomp to symmetry in the way of the roman, western Classic, from which this late antique eastern offshoot had first arisen (58). This development was appropriately named proto-Renaissance. Material — Unity of Construction The structural central wall is composed of ashlar (Macigno), the decorative casing primarily from white Carrara marble and black-green Prato marble. The ashlar core is laid in interlocking layers, according to the changing layering techniques from the middle of the 11th century to 1150 (60). The ashlar core and marble incrustation are interwoven into each other. The central walls arose simultaneously after a unified planning (61). The ashlar can be seen today in the cornices underneath the attic. Originally the corner pillars of the octagon were also executed in ashlar (62). Repurposed columns and capitals that originated from antique buildings were incorporated into the construction (63). Details may be found in the descriptions of individual components. The Construction as a Whole Octagonal central building with an eight-sided, tented, not-very-steep pyramid roof, on whose top an eight-sided lantern rises upward; on the west side there is a horizontal, rectangular choir chapel. Through this chapel, the octagon obtains a line to the west; its central axis lies in the extension of the east-west central axis, formerly situated east from the Baptistery towards Sta Reparata Cathedral. The four that are parallel and right angled to the central axis were treated as main sides, and the four that are diagonally directed are less emphasized. The main sides are distinguished by these three features: they are stretched a little longer, they include the apse and the three portals, and their facades are differentiated from the others through semi-columns, richer tabernacle grouping, and through a richer incrustation motif. Also, the windows of the upper floors, whose somewhat eccentric position in the barrel niches of the gallery initially stand out as a large irregularity, are only shifted to the outside in the two side vaults of each wall in order to be able to fall in the middle of the section on the (longer) exterior of the wall, so in turn they are planned with special sensitivity for organic effect. On the inside, the middle of each of the eight sides differentiates itself from the flanking sides: it is broader and has columns from expensive materials in the biforium of the gallery (64). The main doors (in the East) emerge ahead of the two side doors through the expensive material of the columns that border the main doors. About the very important role that the destroyed baptismal font had played in the structure of the building, see “Under Reconstruction.” The structural framework and decoration, and the interior structure and exterior structure are so deeply related to each other that it is as if they reciprocally reflect one another. Here we see a composition and form completed by a genius architect that appears as High Medieval, but at the same time totally Florentine: his interest in the antique signals his status as an early Renaissance, or Proto-renaissance, builder (65). Exterior On the walls (with the exception of the choir side) three floors contrast with each other: the bottom floor with doors, the middle with windows, and the upper in the shape of an attic. The two bottom floors exhibit reliefs and are connected through corner pillars; The attic does not extend as far outward and exhibits a more restrained relief (66). Good illustrations may be seen in Swoboda, 1933, and Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz, V, 1938, 99. The Corner Pillars. by Arnolfo di Cambio (?), around 1293/96 On each corner of the octagon, around which these are spaced, a pillar protrudes from the walls; modeled after the Pisan style, they are colorfully structured with layers of white and black-green marble. The woodworking of the bottom floor traverses the corner pillars and merges them with the walls. The Base Profile. from Arnolfo di Cambio (?), around 1293/96 and faithfully restored in 1782. The only things preserved from the original were the cylindrical buffers in front of the corners of the octagon (67). Initially, the cobblestones of the piazza were a little bit deeper so that the base profile came more clearly into effect. The Bottommost Floor. from around 1059-1128 Antique Framework: the corner pillars and the pilasters and wall-columns between them support an entablature that cranks itself across all wall supports with camphor; on the four slanting sides of the octagon, every second pilaster is from green marble. On the three straight, longer sides in the south, east, and north, every two wall-columns – together with a connected woodwork piece – forms a doorframe that monumentally emphasizes the three entrances. [Each of these constructions forms a frame around the doorway through which these entrances are monumentally emphasized] (68). All the walls are covered with white marble. Decorative stripes of green marble (verde di Prato) are inlaid in the white surfaces. On the slated sides these form simple rectangles and, indeed, in each intercolumniation there are two taller ones below and three squatter rectangles above. On the three sides with doors, three are richer themes: near each door on both sides there is a giant powerful rectangle, above which appear two transverse rectangles with a central star filling the rectangle, whose dark stripes break up the white squares on their sides. On the corner pillars of the Eastern, most important, Portal stand two antique columns that were stolen in 1117 from the Arabs in Maiorca (69). All the capitals come from that era (70). The Middle Floor. from 1100 to 1128 It nearly corresponds to the bottom floor, but it is somewhat taller than the bottom floor and has more variation. Over each Pilaster and over each half column, a green marble pilaster rises from each abutment as a halved octagon-column with abutments in each case (71); over each of the two half-columns there is a semicircular, delicately-profiled, blind arch from green marble; on the corners of the octagon, these arches rest on the corner pillars described above. The middle arch on each of the three straight portal sides of the south, east, and north is broader and higher than the other arches. The larger width corresponds to the portal width beneath it. Above the arches is a high, but delicately profiled, ancient decorative frame support from gray ashlar (Macigno). In each wall surface appears a window with delicate framing of green marble: on the four slanted sides, the shorter sides of the octagon, there is a round-arched window between the two gabled tabernacle windows; on the three straight main sides of the south, east, and north a tabernacle window sits between two rounded windows. It is the oldest example of antique tabernacle windows and, similarly, of a rhythmic organization of such windows that existed in Tuscany since the beginning of the antique era. It is the greatest example of a High Renaissance motif of this type. On the cornered tabernacles there are pilasters that act as supports for the gables, and on the colonettes there is spiraled fluting—a late antique motif (72). The white marble walls again have a green decorative stripe: under the windows appears an order of the arches of vertical strips and above there are floating rounded arches; under and near the windows there are horizontal stripes; above, in the arches, two sequences of rectangles that disappear above and laterally underneath the arches (73). Above the arches, between these and the encircling entablature, triangular gusset tabs are to be found that replicate the arched, horizontal, and vertical lines of the framing relief partition. These beautiful capitals all date from the construction period (74). The Attic. around 1128 An antique motif and in particular an antique execution. Flatter, lighter, and more delicate than the underneath, somewhat older floors. Particular to this floor, each polygon side of the attic is separated into three fields, and namely through fluted pilaster with especially antique, especially delicate, succulent capitals (75). In each area there is a green banded rectangle, and inside each there are three slim, tall banded rectangles; all bands are from green marble. The wall area and the pilasters are from white marble. On the pilasters rests an antique entablature, that bends downward in a very medieval way onto the eight attic corners and runs along perpendicularly on these corners as far as the base of the attic (76). Above the entablature, there is a wider frieze with magnificently rich, colorfully executed incrustation decoration (77). The Roof. around 1128/1150 Eight-sided, tent-like, flattish, ascending pyramid from white marble (78). At the foot of the approach there is a narrower, delicately incrusted, ornamental band made from a series of gothic pointed quatrefoils; 1339 (79). The Lantern. 1150 (80) A Byzantine motif, implemented here in a structural building, virtually Classical-Antique in decoration, contrasts with the more lavish splendor of the late Romanesque. An octagonal small temple is formed by white marble: eight smooth columns with Composite capitals, with glazing between them; above, an entablature and a robust protruding fillet of marble, both sculpted and encrusted all over in the style of the contemporary Pisan ornamentation (81); Above, a seemingly steep, eight-sided, pyramidal roof from marble is crowned by a bronze cone and a cross. The Choir Chapel. 1202 ff. Named “La Scarsella” (the pilgrim pouch) because of its form. Horizontal rectangular annex on the west side of the octagon. White marble with decorative elements from green and colored marble. The structure connects to the system of the middle floor of the octagon: on each side wall there is a blind arch, on the rear wall there are two blind arches. Rich incrustation ornamentation of late Pisan character. Above on the corners, there are lion heads and masks—motifs that likewise ultimately originate from the formal style of the Pisan Late-Romantic (82). —The four corner pillars and perhaps also the pediment are probably a part of the additions with which Arnolfo di Cambio enriched the Baptistery around 1293/96. Interior This is the actual core of the whole structure. The riches of the room develop from here moving outward. From the structure of the interior, the outer structure is determined (83). The octagonal central room, topped with an eight-sided, peaked, abbey-vaulted cupola. In the west there is a crossed, rectangular choir chapel. — The sketches on page 186 serve as a base illustration of the exact description. — Swoboda took a photo in 1933. See Horn, who was at the Institut in Florence, 1938, 123. The Structural System. Underlying that structural system is the tenant of “active resistance.” The weight of the cupola is not balanced out (like classical Roman structures) through the thickening of these curtain walls, but rather concentrates in its foundations on specific points and passes all the way into the ring of the foundation. We are dealing with a transversal framework. The walls girdles that are exhibited inside and out are not built into the transversal framework but appear to be mounted and superimposed (84). The principle of active resistance was part of the late-antique Byzantine school and contrasted with the Classical Roman system. The chief architect of the Florentine Baptistery had this idea from Byzantium (probably inspired by S. Vitale in Ravenna!), and he continued to boldly develop the principle so that he was always considered one of the greatest innovators in the area of architectural construction. See the construction schematic on page 186. It shows only the emerging framework, not the walls that span it. The Wall Structure. “The foundational framework of the church makes up around the corners of the octagons eight broken powerful pillars. These are the only part of the construction that carry through the whole thickness of the peripheral walls and their full strength is from the base of the cupola area (85). These corner pillars are supported through these in-between walls and spacing, that in the individual floors take on various forms. There, the vertical walls of the polygon support two floors, and both floors each have two layers, an inner and an outer. The outer is comprised from an inner with marble incrusted walls, the outer wall of the octagonal building; It is very thick in the bottom floor, but thinner in the upper floor. The inner layer dissolves into an antique pillar system. Behind two pilasters appear wall pillars, upon which stands each corner of the octagon. An antique entablature and a mosaic frieze lies above and between each of the eight sides between each set of two pillars. Above it arises a light and richly organized upper floor. Each corner pillar, each with two smaller pilasters, has two equal pilasters between them on each polygonal side. Between them on each of the seven sides of the octagon there are three divided openings with semicircular arches (Biforien) which are engaged with the upper floor (freely following S. Vitale in Ravenna); in every opening of the divided, mosaiced balustrade appears a slender dividing center column. Buttresses stretch between the front pillar system and the back wall—I think that’s how they are arrayed radially around the middle point. In the bottom floor behind each intercolumniation there is a segmented arch; in the upper floor behind each biforium there is a large, barrel vaulted niche, on which black and white fresco painting fakes marble incrustation. Above the gallery, there is an antique structure with a mobile frieze. The Cupola. An eight-parted, gothic-arched, monastery dome. The construction is developed out of these underlying zones. The following buttress system is hiding between the eight triangular, spherically curved, cupola peaks and the eight-sided pyramidal roof (86). In the middle of each of the sixteen walls of the gallery arise sixteen support posts (“sproni”), that are arranged to look like abutments against the cupola cap. Between every two support posts there is an attached, upward-rising, narrow barrel vault. Every two other support posts are allotted to the eight corners of the building—”they are so positioned that their outsides are aligned with the edges of the corresponding columns that are underneath the support posts,” which creates, so to speak, a forking of the columns (87). Decoration: on the base of the cupola there is a frieze from a rectangular ornamented field, including medieval reproductions of antique coffering techniques. Each ornamented field has a white, entablature-like, prominent marble frame and a green-black framing laid around it, and contains a figured mosaic. Five squares are allotted on each cupola field; Around each corner there is another square. Above the square friezes there runs a final white-green-white marble striping. Over that is the great cupola mosaic in which the architectural outlines of the walls appear and disappear in the form of painted-on fake columns (88). The Developmental History of the Structure. The octagonal floor plan was taken from the older, Lombard Baptisteries of the sixth century—particularly from S. Vitale in Ravenna— and adds a lantern to the cupola, a gallery (with its biforien) and buttresses in the form of split walls (89). Besides the Byzantine late antique, the architect of the Baptistery was inspired by the classical Roman antique of the early empire through the Pantheon in Rome. The following motifs are inspired by the Pantheon: the structural thinking behind the peripheral wall that is placed against the transversal barrel vault in loadbearing and nonloadbearing zones (90); The expressly horizontal partition of the inner wall by two powerful circumference-running entablature systems and floors; the way the triumphal arches of the choir chapel effectively break up the entablature of the ground floor; the arrangement of pilasters of the upper floor about the arches; the areas, each covered with two columns in the ground floor; and the coffers at the base of the cupola (91). From these Byzantine and Roman principles and motifs that the architect used, he developed something completely new. His invention is probably the octagonal, lancet arched, domical vaults of the cupola (92), and surely his buttressing system is the other invention, with which the functional is merged with the wonderfully beautiful. Essential characteristics of the partitioning system comply with the common European demands of High Medieval Romanesque architecture. Above all, the thing that comes across as Romanesque is the completely un-antique, un-byzantine principle of the structure of frame, inner and outer, that allows the walls to mirror one and the other. The structure of the framework “is traceable” on the partitioning of the wall space and in this way artistically capitalizes on it (93). The abstract orderliness that comes out of the rigor of the spirit of mathematics appears very un-antique and fully Romanesque. “There is not one decorative singular form that is free of this mathematical orderliness; every part of the construction is related to something underneath it or superimposed over it” (94). The last thing that really comes across as Romanesque is that the room, along with its masonry shell, is segmented into a series of sectors that radiate from a central axis of the octagon (95); the central structure doesn’t have the same effect, like the Classical and Byzantine Antique as an image of concentric, circumferential walls and room sequences, but rather as if it is split into a series of radiating yokes. In other words, the central structure is treated in the spirit of the High Romanesque Lombard nave buildings (96). One thing of course differentiates Florentine building from the High Romanesque construction of Northern Europe and also from its Carolingian-Ottonian predecessors, and it is something very serious: there is an antiqued Classicism of incomparable purity, and this Classicism calls a first Renaissance into life—the first attempt of a Florentine architect to revive the values of the national Antique, or the ancient Roman architecture, a search that determined the course of Florentine art up until the High Renaissance. Antique is the simple, peaceful unity of space: in my opinion it is thanks to the great example of the Pantheon that the Byzantine ambulatories and galleries come together here in a relief-like, relaxed wall area (97), that the single-celled octagonal central room, as a result, so majestically comes into its own. The tempietto-form of the cupola lantern is Antique, not Byzantine and not Romanesque! Also, without a doubt, another Antique feature is the fact that there are no sculpted figures to ornament the façade—a completely unRomanesque quality! And finally, its Antique appearance is certainly not the function of the individual elements of the building (an essential Romanesque quality), but a correlation of form and proportion in a consideration of the whole. The Intercolumniation and Other Individual Things. Regarding the external portion of the building see page 182 and following. In the inside, the pilasters in both floors are fluted, the columns themselves are smooth (with the exception of a single one that stands to the right of the east portal). All ancient capitals each consist of a single block of white marble and are gilded; the pilasters have Corinthian-style capitals. On the large columns in the bottom floor they are of the Corinthian and Composite style, while on the little columns of the gallery-biforium the capitals were sculpted in the Ionic style and carry flat Byzantine imposts. The following parts are antique spoils (from the early classical Roman empire?): the fourteen large columns of the ground floor (twelve out of granite from Elba; one, left of the south door, out of Cipollino; and one, the fluted one to the right of this door, out of white marble) (98); the four capitals of the large columns behind the south and north doors; possibly also one or another of the four footings of those columns (99); all the columns in the gallery in the middle of the biforium of every octagonal side are vertical colonnettes (out of Cipollino and white marble; the remaining—not ancient—out of green marble and one out of ashlar) and the three ionic capitals of northwest diagonal, octagonal side immediately to the right of the choir chapel (100). All remaining parts of the columniation—by far the most—come from the High-Medieval building era. The column capitals are a part of one solid block (like the ancients), others are made out of two or more stacked blocks (as was common in Florentine architecture during that period) (101); the large ones in the bottom floor were developed and rounded and, with the exception of two, the small ones on the gallery-biforien are completely front-facing (102). The pilaster capitals, without exception all from the middle ages, are from white marble and each have a frontispiece and two lateral side pieces (103). All high medieval capitals were modeled after the antique and, indeed, are so astoundingly true to that form that you can hardly differentiate them; at best it can said, in the imitation process a little bit of the organic-leafy character of the model pieces can be lost, and therefore it gains a quite hint of medieval systematizing abstraction (104). The consecutive constructive phases were probably brought about by various stone masons and their variations in the way they executed the building. On the ground floor, there are primitive examples with closed contours side by side, with very wide and flat acanthus leaves and with crude singular forms, and also finer examples – the latter are above all on the pilaster on both sides of the choir chapel (105); The later also correspond to the capitals on the first floor of the external part of the building (106). There is a third type that can be found outside on the middle floor of the southeast corner of the octagon (107). From that third type evolved a wonderful, noble type of pilaster capital on the (middle) gallery floor (108). The following can be said about the classicism of the pillar system: Not that they would have been satisfied according to early Christian-Early Medieval custom or according to their own inability to help naively through the plundering of Roman buildings. No, for the first time here in Florence a genius architect dared to try to conjure up a unified antique column system from a very few remains of the golden era, from a few column shafts, capitals, and profiles. On the baptistery the following antique elements of new architecture were added: the Corinthian, Composite, and Ionic system (columns and pilasters); the straight entablature, and the entablature-like arch profile; the imposts; the tabernacle windows; the coffers; the cymatium of various styles and more, indeed in great purity, shines forth out of high medieval European design and also out of contemporary Tuscan design. More important than the inclusion of the classical design was the reinvigoration of the way it is used and the reinvigoration of classical proportions. Very decisively it determines the impression of the building, that columns and pilasters have taken on their original height and strength; that a new strict law of proportionality between the supports and intercolumniation is in place; that the well-proportioned surfaces have again assumed their original level of importance (109). In consideration of all that, the building had to have two main floors designed to adhere to new laws of proportionality; almost every other contemporary builder in the same position would have decorated the walls with a singular overly-slender column system from the ground to the cornice (Medieval Roman!) (110). The approach of the Antique was so convincing that even a century later, the construction was considered a remnant from Roman times, and thus, in the Quattrocento, it came to form the starting point of the Renaissance movement (111). The Incrustation. The Incrustation motif on the walls of the inner rooms are similar to those on the outside, but richer. On the ground floor, the two stories of the rectangular frame reappear on the diagonal sides of the octagon again, and the two floors highlight the façade; but between them a lively connection links their edges, with a row of squares that are turned on their corners, decorated with rosettes, crosses, and other geometric motifs. On the straight, main sides are arches and gables above squares. Between the biforien and the upper gallery geometric forms, understated leafy forms, vases, and lighting unfold in this narrow surrounding strip broken up by the pilasters. In the style of this strip, but freer and lighter, the 13th century mosaic work of the inner gallery is painted (112). The Developmental Historical Meaning of the Incrustation and Decoration (113) The Incrustation motifs originate from the same historical architectural influences as the structure of the building: a few were adopted from the ancient Roman mosaic floors that ran through the foundation of the baptistery; others grew out of the early Christian art of the 4th and 5th centuries; and still others from the Byzantine art of 6th to 11th centuries (114). The luxurious styles of the antique, late antique-early Christian, and Byzantine-early Medieval were just precursors that were translated into the rigor of the High Middle Ages, and indeed likely were connected with the late Byzantine precursors of the middle of the 11th century at S. Marco in Venice (115); the multicolored, joyful expansiveness of the precursors changed to a two-colored abstract rigor (116). The architect defined the template that led to the rich development of the Florentine style all the way up to life and times of Arnolfo di Cambio and Giotto (117). In summary, the following can be said: in the effort to re-enliven the forms of the antique, there was as a last thoroughly defining conclusion: the demand for polychrome, whose amazing fulfillment in the building and primarily of the successive ones like it assured its admiration in future generations. Just as was done with the construction system, the colorful decoration grew from Byzantine roots to neoclassical, Italian, and even to a pronounced Florentine style. This colorful decoration would be foundational through the Gothic and early Renaissance period. In the Byzantine-late antique, the fundamental idea of the composition is probably to turn precious materials into a resplendent whole: we see a connection of black-green and white marble on the walls with reddish Cipollino and gilding on the columns and with mosaic decoration on the cupola, on the architrave and on the gallery balustrades (118). This works in contrast to the attempt to bring these decorations in harmony with the tectonic framework, whose function it is to underline and break up these decoration elements. There, the architect of the Baptistery again went significantly beyond the familiar, standard accomplishments of his contemporaries in Pisa and Venice, and also beyond the Antique itself. Only at the Baptistery and other Florentine buildings done in a similar style are columns, pilasters, entablatures, and arches drawn out through materials of different colors and from the base surface. Only there were the individual parts of these building elements again differentiated, and only there the surface pattern succeeds in filling the outline of the boldly stressed partitioning system. The Flooring Complete with colorful marble Incrustation; the richest example of a medieval marble floor in Florence. The simpler, carpet-like, purely flat patterns probably did not originate from the 12th century. Rather, the more complete and perspective motifs (cubes, zigzags, etc.) originated in the 13th and 14th centuries. All of it is has been abundantly restored. In the southeast quarter of the building, a zodiac and other figural motifs in the style of the 1207 flooring of San Miniato date the floor (119). The Choir Chapel (“La Scarsella”); 1202 ff. A horizontal rectangular chapel on the west side of the octagon. In the four corners, there are four columns, and above that, a groin vault – a motif that was a precursor in ancient Roman baths. The capitals and the very colorful, easily joined Incrustation decoration come across as crude: they originate from the beginning of the end of the Incrustation style (120). Closing Appraisal No other Florentine construction so comprehensively and so perfectly manifested all that Florentine art valued across all ages: strict spirituality that had been developed since the Middle Ages in the Christian Occident; magnificence of Mediterranean cultures which maintained the legacy of Byzantium; but above all, a near-natural, simple, and yet still wonderful, fine, and beautiful structure built in the spirt of the ancient Roman classics. That is why this “Temple” of the holy patron saint of Florence, the “bel San Giovanni” (so named by Dante due to his loving nature), for all times has been considered the symbol of the city of Florence, its spirit, and its self-assurance (121). Baugeschichte S. Giovanni Das Baptisterium ist noch immer eines der großen Rätsel der Architekturgeschichte. Schon seit dem hohen Mittelalter ein Lieblingsgegenstand der historischen Phantasie,wird es bis auf den heutigen Tag von ernsten Gelehrten bald ins vierte und fünfte Jahrhundert, bald ins siebente und achte, bald ins elfte, zwölfte, dreizehnte, oder gar fünfzehnte Jahrhundert datiert, so daß seine Ansetzung noch immer um ein volles Jahrtausend schwankt. Allgemein aufgegeben ist nur die älteste, schon im Zeitalter Dantes nachweisbare These, der Bau sei eine Schöpfung der römsichen Antike, etwa ein Marstempel (2). Aufzugeben ist meiner Meinung nach auch die noch ältere, bereits im frühen 13. Jahrhunder nachweisbare Datierung in die frühschristliche Epoche (3). Nur bedingt richtig ist schließlich die Hypothese eines Ursprungs in langobardischer Zeit (4); ebenso bedingt annehmbar nur auch jene andere Hypthese der Gründung im elften oder zwölften Jahrhundert (5); ganz falsch die Legende von wesentlichen Zufügungen der Frührenaissance (6). Ich gründe meine Darstellung auf die Dokumente und den Baubefund, vor allem aber auf die Ergebnisse der Leider sehr unvollständigen Ausgrabungen des letzten Halbjahrunderts (7). Unter der Kirche befinden sich Reste von drei älteren Kulturschichten. Erstens Reste eines römischen Palastes, der wohl in augusteischer Zeit errichtet und noch in römischer Zeit zerstört wurde. Zweitens, in den Ruinen dieses Palastes eingenistet, Reste von spätantiken Wohnhäusern und Thermen, die ebenfalls zerstört wurden (aber erst nach dem Ende des 4. Jahrhunderts). Drittens Gräber wurde vondem Fundament des linken Eckpfeilers der Baptisteriumsapsishalb zerstört (8). – Zugang zu den Ausgrabungen: in der Apsis. Eine Johanneskirche im nordöstlichen Winkel des römischen Mauerringes, also an der heutigen Stelle, wird urkundlich erwähnt zuerst 897 (9), und dann 909, 967, 990, und 1040 (10). Möglicherweise war sie ursprünglich Baptisterium und Konkathedrale der hlg. Reparata: spätestens um die Mitte des 11. Jahrhunderts trat sie die Kathedralen würde aber ganz an die vor ihr liegende Basilika S. Reparata abund diente seither ausschließlich als Taufkirche und Stift der Domkanoniker (11). Vielleicht stand dieser Wechsel in Zusammenhangdamit, daß damals einschneidende Veränderungen an dem Bau bewirkt wurden. 1059 oder 1061 nahm Papst Nikolaus II., Exbischof von Florenz, anscheinend eine Weihe in S. Giovanni vor, und zwar wahrscheinlich die Grunsteinweihe für einen monumentalen Neubau (12). Die Bautätigkeit scheint dann ein volles Jahrhundert angedauert zu haben. 1113 muß das Erdgeschoß bereits großenteils fertig gewesen sein, da man an einem seiner Wände den Bischof Rainer beisetzte, dessen lange Regierungstätigkeit (1077-1113) eng mit den ersten großen Fortschritten des Neubaus verbunden gewesen sein mag (13). 1117 waren die Arbeiten offenbar noch im Gang, denn zu ihrer Förderung doch wohl schenkten die Pisaner den Florentinern zwei Säulen, die dann vor dem Gebäude aufgestellt wurden (14). 1128 wurde das Erdgeschloß anscheinend in Benutzung genommen (15). 1150 beschloß die Aufsetzung der Laterne den Kuppelbau, der 1128 vielleicht auch schon im wesentlichen fertig gewesen war (16), und damit das ganze Bauunternehmen (17). Schon um diese Zeit scheint die Calimalazunft, die Zunft der Kaufleute, den Bau und die Bauhütte, die weiter bestehen blieb, detreut zu haben (18). Nachtträglich wurden an der fertigen Kirche noch einige nicht unwesentliche Veränderungen vorgenommen. 1202 ersetzte man die halbkreisförmige Apsis durch eine rechtickige Chorkapelle, die sogenannte “Scarsella” (19). Um 1207 war der Marmorfußboden in Arbeit (20). In der zweiten Hälfte des 13. Jahrhunderts erhielt die große Kuppel ihren Mosaikschmuck (21). – In den achtziger und neunziger Jahren endlich wurde das Baptisterium ein letztes Mal zum Gegenstand größerer architecktonischer Projekte, und zwar im Zusammenhang mit der Neugestaltung des Domes und des Domplatzes. 1285 begann man mit der Herstellung eines neuen Pflasters auf dem Platz (22), 1293 oder 1296 inkrustierte Arnolfo di Cambio nach Beseitigung vieler Grabdenkmäler die bis dahin aus grauem Haustein (Macigno) bestehenden äußeren Eckpfeiler des Oktogons mit schwarzgrünen und weißen Marmorschichten; wahrscheinlich wollte er dadurch die Taufkirche seiner neuen, stark mit diesem Mittel wirkenden Domfassade anpassen; er erneuerte anscheinend auch das obere Profil der Basis des Baptisteriums (23). Seither ist S. Giovanni nur mehr restauriert worden, allerdings sehr häufig und ziemlich durchgreifend. 1339 reinigte man den verschmutzten Marmarbelag und erneuerte die oberste Ornamentleiste des Kranzgesimses (24). 1341-46, 1364, 1389/90 fanden Reparaturen am Marmordach statt (25). 1444-1471 mußte der Plattenbelag des Daches noch einmal unvollständig erneuert werden (26). Lionardo da Vinci soll das ganze Gebäude mechanisch in die Luft haben heben wollen, um einen Sockel darunter setzen zu können (27). 1515 wurde aus statischen Gründen in Höhe des zweiten Gesimses eine Kette in das Mauerwerk eingelassen (28). 1548 fanden weitere, nicht genauer definierte Restaurierungen statt (29). 1577 entfernte Buontalenti trotz heftigster Proteste der Bürgerschaft das mittelalterliche Taufecken und den dauzugehörigen Kanonikerchor aus dem Kirchenraum, um Platz für eine Taufdekoration zu Ehren des Don Filippo, des Erstgeborenen des großherzogs Francesco I., zu schaffen (30); es war die schwerste Verstümmelung, die das Gebäude je erlitten hat. 1722 ließen die Kanoniker einen Sakristeiraum in die Apsis einbauen und davor neue Chorschranken errichten (31). Um 1782 reinigte der ARchitekt Giuseppe Manetti das Gebäude und erneuerte das Sockelgesims (32). 1895-1902 wurde das Steinwerk der Laterne, der Tribuna und der Ostseite des Oktogons auseinandergenommen und neu zusammengefügt (33). Damals und 1912/15 entfernte man die barocken Zutaten in der Apsis und an den Altären. 1887 wurde die nordwestliche Hälfte der Piazza S. Giovanni ausgegraben, 1895/97 die südwestliche Hälfte, und 1912/15 wurden die verschiedenen Bauschichten unter der Westhälfte der Kirche freigelegt (34).–Eine völlige Klärung der Baugeschichte kann nur durch Erforschung der übrigen, einstweilen unberührten Geländeteile unter dem Baptisterium und dem Platz erreicht werden. Anmerkungen (1) Dokument von 899: Geschichte von Florenz I, 1896, 73. (2) Die Vorstellung, S. Giovanni sei ursprüglich ein Tempel des angeblichen heidnischen Stadtpatrons von Florenz, des Mars, gewesen und sei dann dem jüngeren, christlichen Stadtpatron, dem Täufer Johannes, zu Ehren umgeweiht worden, liegt schon einigen Versen Dantes zugrunde (Inferno XIII, 143, 156; XIX, 16; vgl. darüber Lumachi, Mem. stor. 1782, 4; Gruyer, Les oeuvres d’art de la Renaissance au Temple de St. Jean, 1875, 271). Der Meinung Dantes folgte sein Kommentator Boccaccio (Richa V, 1757, XXVII). Giovanni Villani (lib. I, cap. XLII und LX) gab dieser Legende eine bestimmtere Form, indem er behauptete, das Bauwerk sei zur Zeit des Augustus von stadtrömischen Bauleuten zu Ehren des Mars errichtet und zur Zeit Papst Silvesters und Kaiser Konstantins in eine Kirche des Täufers verwandelt worden; deutlich läßt dabei seine Erwähnung der Ähnlichkeit zwischen S. Giovanni und dem Pantheon den Anlaß zur Bildung dieser Legende erkennen. Unter den Anhängern dieser These im 14. Jahrhundert werden noch Petrarca und Franco Sacchetti gennant, unter denen des 15. Jahrhunderts Matteo Palmieri und Polizian (Richa V, 1757, VI, und andere), und wir können zu den letzteren noch den um 1475 schreibenden Piero Cennini fügen (Riv. d’A VI, 1909, 220). Im Cinquecento spricht Albertini von dieser These, und zwar mit einigen Ausschmückungen (Memoriale, 1510, 9); ebenso spielt Vasari darauf an (I, 333, VIII, 425), und auch Poccianti (Vite de’sette Beati Fiorentini, 1589, 140). Besonders aber verlieh der hochgelehrte Vincenzo Borghini der Marstempeltheorie eine höhere Wirksamkeit, indem er auf Crund des antikiserenden Charackters der Bauformen die Gegenmeinung zu entkräften versuchte, S. Giovanni könne im langobardischer Zeit als Taufkirche gegründet sein, und indem er eine zeichnerische Rekonstruktion des von ihm vermuteten ursprünglichen Zustands seines “Marstempels” gab (Discorsi, I, 1584, 145ff., 149f., 153, 154, 156f., 162; siehe auch den Brief vom 23. XI. 1564 bei Gaye, III, 1840, 158). Cinelli suchte auf Grund einer handschriftlichen Chronik in der Laurenziana die Entstehung des Baus auf das Jahr 35 nach Chrsiti Geburt festzulegen (Bocchi-Cinelli, 1677, 25). Zuletzt nahm noch Richa an, wenigstens die äußere Mauerschale könne von einem Marstempel übrig geblieben sein (V, 1757, XII, XIII). – Die Marstempelthese wurde dann im 17. und 18. Jahrhundert durch die Beobachtung erschüttert, daß die achteckige Form von S. Giovanni nicht aus dem heidnischen, wohl aber aus dem christlichen Kult erklärt werden könne, und daß in dem Bau vielfach Spoilien aus zerstörten römischen Bauten verwendet worden sind, daß er also aus mittelalterlicher Zeit stammen müsse (Del Migliore, 1684, 82, 84; Lami Lezioni, I, 135; und andere). Im 19. Jahrhundert wurde diese Beweisführung, fortgesetzt und vertieft (vgl. vor allem Hübsch, Die altchristlichen Kirchen etc., 1862, Spalte 41 ff. und Nardini, S. Giovanni, 1902, 7, 8). – Endgültig widerlegt wurde die Marstempel-These erst durch die Ausgrabungen des 19. und 20. Jahrhunderts, die unter den Grundmauern des Baptisteriums zu oberst einen Friedhof aus der Völkerwanderungszeit, dann Gebäudereste aus spätrömischer Epoche und zu unterst Reste eines Palastes aus frühkaiserlicher Zeit zutage förderten (1. Jahrh. nach Christi Geburt?). Vgl. unten Anm. 8 und Swoboda, Kunstwissenschaftliche Forschungen II, 1933, 64. – Ich gebe als Anhang noch einen Überblick, wie die genannten Autoren sich den hypothetischen Marstempel vorstellen. Vorbild der rekonstruierenden Phantasie war zugegebenermaßen das Pantheon. So vermutete Giovanni Villani, das Gebäude habe in heidnischer Zeit keine Apsis gehabt und keine Laterne, sondern eine unbedeckte Kreisöffnung im Scheitel der Kuppel (lib. I, cap. LX). Schon früh gesellte sich zu diesen antikischen Zügen noch der aus Vitruv als typisch bekannte Stufensockel, das Podium (Piero Cennini, 1475; vgl. Riv. d’A. VI, 1909, 221), und der ebenfalls durch die inzwischen vertieften archäologischen Kenntnisse erforderte Porticus im Westen (Vincenzo Borghini, Discorsi I, 1584, 163, 164). In diesem Stadium wurde die Theorie durch die Holzschnitte Borghinis veranschaulicht. Abhängig von Borghini vor allem Bocchi-Cinelli (1677, 26) und Del Migliore (1684, 88f., 97), der aber doch schon einige Kritik übt. Eine neue und letzte, mehr an den römischen Amphitheatern orientierte Holzschnitt-Rekonstruktion gab Richa (V, 1757, XII, XIII). Foll.-Rastr. erwähnen noch eine gemalte Rekonstruktion (III, 1791, 11). Vgl. auch Lumachi, Mem. stor. 1782. 13f. (3) Die These der Entstehung des Baptisteriums in frühchristlicher Zeit ist noch etwas älter als die Marstempel-These. Schon im frühen 13. Jahrh. besagte die Chronica de origine civitatis, S. Giovanni sei nach der Zerstörung der Stadt durch Totila von römischen Meistern erbaut worden, und zwar in Nachahmung von S. Giovanni in Laterano (siehe Swoboda, Baptisterium, 1918, 64). Hundert Jahre später “verbesserte” Ricordano Malespini Giovanni Villanis These dahin, daß der Bau zur Zeit des Todes Christi zu Ehren des Johannes erbaut worden sei (Istoria fiorentina, ed. Livorno, 1830, I, cap. 38, 82). Im 16. Jahrhundert vertrat Girolamo Mei dieselbe Meinung gegenüber Vincenzo Borghini (vgl. darüber Manni, Principii della religione cristiana, 1764, 73/74). Damals vertiefte Del Migliore noch diese These durch Erneuerung des uralten Hinweises auf die Ähnlichkeit des Baus mit anderen Baptisterien wie S. Giovanni in Laterano, Pisa, Pistoria, Parma etc. (vgl. auch Richa V, 1757, VI). Für das 18. Jahrhundert vgl. Gori (Lumachi, Mem. stor. 1782, 6 ff.) und Manni, der die Theorie von der Gründung zu Baptisteriumszwecken noch durch einen Hinweis auf die für diesen Zweck typische Lage vor der Fassade der Kathedrale betonte (Principii della Religione cristiana, 1764 S. 73/74; Gegengründe bei del Rosso, Ricerche, 1820, 28f.). Im 19. Jahhundert glaubte G. Cordero den Bau wegen seiner Verwandtschaft mit den antikisierend-byzantinischen Schöpfungen Theoderichs und Justinians ins 6. Jahrhundert setzen zu sollen (Dell’Italiana Architettura durante la dominazione longobarda, Bescia, 1829, 203f.). Ebenso dachten Rumohr und Fergusson an die Möglichkeit eines frühchristlichen Ursprungs (Ital. Forsch. III, 1831, 178, 180; A history of architecture, 1874, I, 437). Mit höchster Energie verfochten wurde diese Meinung aber von Hübsch und Nardini. Hübsch setzte den Kernbau ins 4. oder 5. Jahrhundert, die Bioforien der inneren Empore aber ins 13. Jahrhundert (Detucsches Kunstblatt, 1855, 184ff.; Die altchristlichen Kirchen etc. 1862, Spalte 41 ff.; Gegengründe bei Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, 61). Nardini baute seine temperamentvoll vorgetragene Hypothese auf historischen Erwägungen auf (Erwähnung des Baptisteriums schon im 8. Jahrhundert. Unwahrscheinlichkeit der Gründung in der ärmlichen langobardischen Epoche) und suchte sie durch stilistische Vergleiche mit anderen, ähnlichen, frühchristlichen Bauten zu sichern (Ähnlichkeit mit S. Lorenzo in Mailand und S. Vitale in Ravenna, Absetzung gegen die sicheren Bauten des 11. und 12. Jahrhunderts wie S. Miniato etc); vgl. A. e st. VII, 1888, 129ff., 132 ff. und S. Giovanni,1902, 4ff., 16ff., 39ff., 46/47ff., 76, 78, 79-81, 87, 100 etc. Wie Nardini urteilte auch Reymond (La sculpture florentine II, 1898, 79/80). Gegen ihn argumentierten überzeugend Davidsohn, der die Haltlosigkeit der historischen Grundlagen Nardinis nachwies (Forschungen z. G. Florenz IV, 1908, 461) und Supino (Gli Albori, 1906, 26-34, 47). In denselben Jahren ergaben die Ausgrabungen das römische Wohnungen standen und daß sich in der folgenden Völkerwanderungszeit dort ein Friedhof entwickelte, dessen Datierung zwischen dem 6. und 8. Jahrhundert strittig ist (vgl. unten Anm. 8). Damit ist der frühchristlichen These endgültig der Boden entzogen. Doch hat sie noch immer Anhänger, wie Venturi (Storia I, 1901, 103), Toesca (Storia III, 1927, 105ff. und 648ff.), Rupp, Inkrustationsstil, 1912, 24, 58 ff., und Anthony, Art Stud. V, 1927, 107. (4) Für einen langobardischen Ursprung des Baptisteriums erklärte sich zuerst G. B. Nelli, indem er auf den Johanneskult der Langobarden hinwies (Piante ed alzati di S. Maria del Fiore IV, 34, 37; Exzerpte bei Richa V, 1755, VIIf. und Rupp, Inkrustationsstil, 1912, 23, 24). Lami präzisierte diese Theorie dahin, daß die Königin Theolinde den Täufer zum Schutzpatron des Reichs erwählt habe und daß die Florentiner diesem Regierungsakt zuliebe ihren Johannesdom gegründet hätten (Mon. II, 1758, 937ff.; Lezioni d’antichità cristiane, 1766, I, 59/60; abgedruckt bei Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, 53f.). Lamis Theorie gründet sich wohl auf eine Stelle über den Johanneskult der Langobarden bei Paulus Diakonus (Bald. I, 76 ff.). Der Meinung Lamis folgten: Paciaudi, De cultu S. Jo. Baptistae, 1755, 14; Lastri, Oss. 1777, II, 51: Lumachi, Mem. stor. 1782, 7ff.; Foll.-Rastr. III, 1791, 11; d’Agincourt, Historie de l’art par les monumens I, ARchitecture 1811-23, 119; M. I. Isabelle, Les édifices circulaires et les d’mes, 1855, 105; Prezzolini, Storia politico-religiosa del popolo fiorentino I, 1865, 93; I. Fergusson, A history of architecture I, 1874, 437; Hartwig, Quellen zur Geschichte von Florenz I, 1875, 82; G. B. Befani, Mem. stor. 1884, 15; R. Cattaneo, L’architettura in Italia dal secolo VI al mille, 1888, 46f.; A e st. XVI, 1897, 100.- Energisch bestätigt wurde diese Meinung – unter Heranziehung von Urkunden aus langobardischer Zeit, die das Florentiner Baptisterium erwähnen! – von Davidsohn und Frey, und zwar noch einmal bestätigt in dem (irrigen) Sinne, daß das heutige Gebäude mit Ausnahme der Inkrustation langobardisch sei (Geschichte von Florenz I, 1896, 41, 72; Forschungen z. G. Florenz I, 1896 146; Loggia de’Lanzi, 1885, 62; Vasari I, 1911, 576f.) So auch Behne, Inkrustationsstil in Toscana, 1912, 90/91 und Milani, Annali d’Ingegneria e Architettura, 1918. – Die Gegengründe gegen die langobardische These hat G. Cordero zusammengestellt (Dell’italiana architettura durante la dominazione longobarda, Bescia, 1829, 203f.) Vgl. auch Schnaase, Geschichte der bildenden Künste im Mittelalter I, 1871, 442 und vor allem Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, 46 sowie Swoboda, Baptisterium, 1918, 60. Der Stil der Konstruktion und der Dekoration des jetzigen Baus verbietet eine Ansetzung vor dem 11. Jahrhundert (vgl. unten). Doch bliebt als brauchbarer Gewinn dieser These, daß das Vorhandensein eines älteren langobardischen Baus an dieser Stelle dokumentarisch bewiesen worden ist (vgl. auch unten). (5) Kugler meinte, die 1117 erfolgte Schenkung von zwei Säulen an die Florentiner durch die Pisaner müsse als ein Beitrag Zum Bau des Baptisteriums aufgefaßt werden; der Baubeginn könne also um 1117 angesetzt werden, der Abschluß des Baus um 1150 (Villani: Aufsetzungetnug der Laterne); vgl. Geschichte der Baukunst II, 1858, 58f. (Polemik daran anschließen: Hübsch, im Deutschen Kunstblatt, 1855, l84ff.; Kugler ebenda, S. 228; wie Hübsch auch Forschungen z. G. Florenz I, 1896, 24). Der Meinung von Kugler schlossen sich folgende Autoren an: Burckhardt (Cicerone I, 1860, 110: mit Herabrückung ins Ende des 12. Jahrhunderts); Lübke in den Mitteilungen der k. k. Zentral-Kommission V, 1860, 169 (mit Zurückdatierung ins 11. Jahrhundert); Schnaase (Mitteilungen der k. k. Zentralkommission, 1860, V, 169; Geschichte der Baukunst IV, 1871, 442: mit Zurückdatierung ins 11. Jahrhundert), Dehio-v. Bezold (Kirchliche Baukunst des Abendlandes, I, 1892, 544). – Diese Meinung litt an dem Fehler, daß die Dokumente aus der Zeit vor dem II. Jahrhundert nicht berücksichtigt wurden (außer von Schanaase), die das Vorhandensein eines älteren Baus bewiesen. Andererseits brachten sie überzeugende und dokumentarisch bestätige Beweisgründe für die Datierung des heutigen Baus bei. Beide Argumentgruppen berücksichtigte dann zuerst Supino, dessen Beweisführung ich weiter zu entwickeln versuche. (6) Rupp, Inkrustationsstil, 1912 (S. 80 und an vielen anderen Stellen). Diese These könnte für sich in Anspruch nehmen, daß ein Wappen des frühen 15. Jahrhunderts im Hof des Bargello das Baptisterium ohne die Attika zeigt. Doch beweisen die Fresken des 14. Jahrhunderts im Bigallo und im Hof von S. Croce, sowie die Truhe aus dem frühen 15. Jahrhundert im Bargello eindeutig, daß die Attika damals schon vorhanden war. Die Dokumente des Trecento beweisen ferner, daß Attika und Dach damals bereits erneuerungsbedürftig, also schon sehr alt waren. – Rupps Beweisführung verdient keine ernstliche Widerlegung. Ihr folgte – unbegreiflicherweise! – Frankl (Handbuch für Kunstwissenschaft, Die frühmittelalterliche und romanische Baukunst, 1926, 225). (7) Mein Ausgangspunkt ist die auf synthetische Untersuchungen gestützte, alle früheren Argumente zusammenfassende These Supinos, daß das Baptisterium in langobardischer Zeit gegründet, im 11. und 12. Jahrhundert aber von Grund auf erneuert worden sei. Für den Ursprung des Gebäudes wies Supino auf die Dokumente hin, für die Erneuerung auf den stilistischen Charakter des Baus, dessen Verwandtschaft mit datierten Bauten des 11. Jahrhunderts (Empoli usw.) und dessen entwickelte Formen eine solche Ansetzung erforden (Gli Albori, 1906, 18 ff., 26ff., 53f., 56f., 58.; nicht stichhaltige Gegengründe bei Frey-Vasari I, 1911, 580 und Anthony, ARt Stud. V, 1927, 108). Vgl. auch Testi e Rodolico, Le arti figurative nella storia d’Italia, 1907, 322. Swoboda suchte mit völlig verfehlten stilkritischen Darlegungen die von Supino gegebenen Daten dahin zu variieren, daß der beschluß zum Neubau 1050 gefaßt worden sei (Baptisterium, 1918, 74ff.); gegen ihn sprechen die Dokumente und er Stil, vgl. unten. Wie Swoboda urteilte auch Frankl, Die frühmittelalterliche Baukunst, 1926, 224. Beenken rückte den Bau in die zweite Hälfte des 10. und in die erste Hälfte des 11. Jahrhunderts (Z.f.b. K. LX, 1926/27, 250ff.). Salmi setzte ihn meines Erachtens viel richtiger in die zweite Hälfte des 11. Jahrhunderts (Arch. rom. 9). Meine Darstellung sicht die Datierung Supinos und Salmis durch Berücksichtigung neuer Anhaltspunke zu erhärten. (8) Wegen der Bedeutung dieser Reste sollen die im Haupttext gemachten kurzen Andeutung hier noch genauer erläutert werden. Über dem Gelände des Baptisteriums und des heute verschwundenen Ostflügels des bischöflichen Palastes ist in frühkaiserlicher Zeit ein großer, mosaikgeschmückter Palast erbaut worden der von den Archäologen hypothetisch als Prätorium angesprochen wird, d. h. als Amtssitz des Kommandanten der römischen Militärkolonie Florenz. Dieser Palast muß dann zerstört worden sein und seine Trümmer den Einflüssen der Witterung lange dargeboten haben. In spät­-antiker Zeit wurden seine Überreste zur Errichtung ärmlicher Wohnungen und Thermen verwendet, die nach Maßgabe von Münzfunden noch im 5. Jahr­hundert nach Christi Geburt in Benutzung waren: Münze des Kaisers Hono­rius (Regierungszeit 395–423). Später müssen auch sie zerstört worden sein (wohl von den Goten). In dem allmählich über ihren Resten sich ansam­melnden Erdreich wurde schließlich von Germanen (Goten oder Lango­barden: charakteristische Grabfunde!) ein Friedhof angelegt, der das ganze oben abgegrenzte Areal überdeckte. Die Zeit, in der das geschah, ist strittig. Nach Gallis Meinung, die sich auf den Typus der Gräber und auf den Stil ihrer Beigaben stützt, käme das 6./7. Jahrhundert in Frage; nach Toesca dagegen bereits das späte 5. Jahrhundert (vgl. die Polemik Galli-Tarchiani-­Toeaca in Marzocco, 1917). Hätte Toesca recht, so könnte das Baptisterium, das auf diesem Friedhof errichtet wurde und ihn z. T. zerstörte, bereits im 6. Jahrhundert gegründet worden sein (vgl. auch Toesca, Storia, 1927, lO5ff.). Doch scheint mir Toescas Frühdatierung der Gräber mißlungen (so auch Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 101). Wie Horn richtig fordert, müßte die Datierung der Gräber noch einmal von frühgeschichtlicher Seite her sachkundig untersucht und genauer geklärt werden. Berichte und Dis­kussion über die Ausgrabungsergebnisse: Supino, Gli Albori, 1906; Fra­schatti, A. e st. XXVII, 1908, 160f.; Galli, Riv. d’A.

I, 1758, 940; Hartwig, Quellen und Forschungen I, 1875, 83; Forschungen z. G. Florenz IV, 1908, 461; Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, 29 usw.). – Über den Erhaltungszustand des Baptisteriums im 10. Jahrhundert vgl. Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 110, Anm. 2. Die Entstehungszeit dieses ältesten Baptisteriums kann nach oben, gegen die Spätantike hin, abgegrenzt werden durch das Datum des germanische Friedhofs; diese Datum lieglt schwerlich vor dem 6. Jahrhundert und vielleicht erst im 7. Jahrhundert (vgl. vorige Anm.). Dies bliebt bestehen, auch wenn es nicht die Mauern des Gründungsbaus waren, die eines der Germanengräber zerstörten (so urteilte Galli), sondern die Fundamente des Erneuerungsbaus aus dem 11. Jahr­hundert (wie es meines Erachtens der Augenschein lehrt): denn die Gräber nehmen offenbar noch keine Rücksicht auf einen Kirchenbau, unter dem und um den herum sie an sich möglicherweise angelegt sein könnten. Die Aus­grabungen bestätigen also die Theorie des langobardischen Ursprungs der Kirche und schließen eine Entstehung vor dem späten 5. Jahrhundert aus. So jetzt auch Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 100. – Ob die jetzigen Fundamente des Baptisteriums langobardisch sind oder ob sie aus dem 11./12. Jahrhundert stammen, bzw. ob in dem jetzigen, offensichtlich großenteils aus dem 11./12. Jahrhundert herrührenden Fundament-Oktogon ein älteres, langobardisches stekt (was sehr wahrscheinlich sein dürfte), ist bei der vgl. darüber unter Rekonstruktion Anm. 35. – Die langobardische Johanneskirche lag in einem Winkel des Mauerrings, ähnlich wie der Pisaner Dombezirk, nicht aber außerhalb der Mauern, wie manchmal behauptet worden ist (vgl. darüber Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, 55f. und den Plan bei Rupp, Inkrustationsstil, 1912, 44).

Florenz, V, 1938, 102, Anm. 4. – Auszuscheiden ist Richas Nachricht (V, 1755, XXV), der Astrologe Strozzo Strozzi habe 1048 den Zodiakus im Fußboden von S. Giovanni anlegen lassen; der Zodiakus kann aus stilistischen Gründen erst um 1207 (Fußboden von S. Miniato) entstanden sein. (11) Für die Kathedraltheorie sprechen die Dokumente, die bis zur Mitte des 11. Jahrhunderts das Florentiner Bistum nach Johannes dem Täufer benennen, dann eine Zeitlang nach Johannes und nach der hlg. Reparata, und erst seit dem 12. Jahrhundert ausschließlich nach der letzteren. Gegen diese Theorie spricht die achteckige Form, die S. Giovanni von Anfang an zur Taufkirche bestimmt erscheinen läßt, und die Tatsache, daß die Basilika der hlg. Reparata genau in der Lage und Gestalt gegründet wurde, die ein Dom im Verhältnis zu seiner Taufkirche in dieser Zeit gewöhnlich hatte. Vgl. über diese Frage unter S. Maria del Fiore und S. Reparata; siehe auch vor allem folgende Literatur: Del Migliore, 1684, 87; Lami, Mon. II, 1758, 937f.; Lumachi, Mem. stor. 1782, 15ff. Cianforgni, S. Lorenzo, 50ff.; Del Rosso, Richerche, 1820, 28ff.; Frey, Loggia de’Lanzi, 1885, 62, 63; Geschichte von Florenz I, 1896, 72, 73, 337; Nardini, 1902, 68ff.; 75ff.; Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, 27ff., 49, 57/58; Frey-Vasari I, 1911, 578f.; Rupp, Inkrustationsstil, 1912, 28ff., Swoboda, 1918, 59, 62 (ganz irrig); C. W. Anthony, Art Stud. V, 1927, 103, 105. – Galli hielt irrtümlich die Fundamente des Taufbeckens des 12. Jahrhunderts für langobardisch (Riv. d’A. IX, 1916/18, 182). (12) Über dieses Datum vgl. neuerdings Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 112. Seine Darlegung sei hier wiedergegeben, da sie alle einschlägigen Pro­bleme vorbildlich klarlegt. “Das Dokument der Weihe ist verloren oder hat niemals existiert. Davidsohn (Geschichte von Florenz 1, 1896, 218, Anm. 3) hat in der Sakristei des Baptisteriums ein von ,, ,,einer Hand des 17. oder 18. Jahrhunderts geschriebenes” “ Verzeichnis der Feste von S. Giovanni gesehen, in dem unter dem 6. November 1059 die Dedikation der Kirche durch Nikolaus II. angeführt war (Verbleib unbekannt). Die Weihe ist schon erwähnt bei Del Migliore, 1684, 111, nur wird dort als Datum statt des 6. November 1059 der 6. November 1061 angegeben. Nach Del Migliore, der sich auf Ughelli beruft (Italia sacra III, wo ich eine entsprechende Erwähnung nicht finden kann), stammt diese Nachricht von dem Senatore Carlo Strozzi, ,, ,,che fra le scritture del monastero di S. Felicità ve ne trovasse una, che mostrava essersi stata fatta tale funzione, per mano d’un papa che fu Niccolò II (quelli che era stato vescovo di Firenze sotto il nome di Gherardo di Borgogne) nel anno secondo del suo pontificato, che cade nel 1061””. Der 6. November ist – Hinweis Davidsohns – als Weihtag von S. Giovanni schon in den am Ende des 12. Jahrhundersts. geschriebenen Rubricae ecclesiasticae, Cod. Riccard. 3005 (3138), f. 96a angeführt, dort aber ohne Jahrsangabe, und weiterhin – aber auch hier ohne Jahresangabe – in den wahrscheinlich zwischen 1228 und 1332 geschreibenen Mores et Consuetudines canonicae florentinae (vgl. dazu acuh Nardini, S. Giovanni, 1902, und Supino, Gli albori, 1906, 61f.). – Die Überlieferung behält, da der Zusammenhang von Tages- und Jahresdatum nicht gesichert ist, doch immerhin etwas Zweifelhaftes, trotz des Alteres der Tagesfeier und trotz dem Hinweis Del Migliores auf eine angeblich von dem Senatore Strozzi unter den Schriften von S. Felicità gefundes Dokument mit jenem Datum.” - Frey kannte den hier dargelegten Sachverhalt, hielt ihn aber merkwürdigerweise für völlig unverbindlich, da ihm die Vornahme einer so wichtigen Weihe an einem Sonnabend (statt Sonntag) unwahrscheinlich vorkam (Vasari I, 1911, 577). Auch Davidsohn und Swoboda (Baptisterium, 1918, 63) zweifelten an der Zuverlässigkeit des Datums. Ihnen und Frey widersprach mit überzeugenden Gründen Salmi (Arch. rom. S. 37). Er meinte jedoch (S. 35), der Neubau könne bei der Weihe von 1059 noch nicht gut vollendet gewesen sein. Ich gehe in dieser Richtung noch weiter, indem ich die Weihe als eine Anfangsweihe, nicht aber als eine Schlußweihe deute, und werde dazu durch die Tatsache angeregt, daß noch bis 1150 fortdauernd Bauarbeiten in Gang waren (vgl. unten). Diese Tatsache ist auch ein Haupt­grund gegen die stilistisch ebenfalls unhaltbare Datierung Beenkens (10. Jahrh. 1. Hälfte 11. Jahrh.: Z. f. b. K. LX, 1926/27, 250f. - Damit wende ich mich auch gegen Swobodas Berichtigung seiner älteren These, die darauf hinausläuft, das Datum 1059 sei zuverlässig, bezeichne aber die Voll­endung des langobardischen Baus, nicht die Begründung der jetzigen Kirche (Kunstwissensch. Forschungen II, 1933, 74). - Horn (a. a. O., 1938, 112/113) legte die Überlieferung des Datums in der oben wiedergebenen Weise klar und kam zu dem Schluß, das Datum sei immerhin zweideutig und zweifelhaft, und es bliebe noch zu klären, ob es philologisch zu REcht als Termin einer Gründungsweihe gedeutet werden könne. Dennoch stimmte Horn meiner Annahme zu, das heutige Baptisterium müsse um 1059/61 begonnen sein (a. a. O., 1938, 113/114). Seine Gründe sind folgende: Erstens die Verwandtschaft des jetzigen Baus mit S. Miniato, bzw. mit den Teilen dieser Kirche, die im zweiten Drittel des 11. Jahrhunderts entstanden. Zweitens die Tatsache, daß die Baptisteriumskapitelle etwas jünger wirken als die Kapitelle der romanischen Kirche S. Felicità, die ebenfalls von Papst Nikolaus II. eingeweht wurde, und zwar einen Tag nach der angeblichen Grundsteinweihe von S. Giovanni – am 7. November 1059. Dritten muß der Bau, wie die zusammenhängende, zäsurenlose Entwicklungsfolge seiner Kapitelltypen beweist, in einer einzigen zusammenhängenden und nicht allzu langen Bauführung errichtet worden sein, und das heißt, daß er schwerlich vor der Mitte des 11. Jahrhunderts begonnen sein kann, da seine Kuppel 1128 anähernd vollendet und 1150 ganz fertig war (vgl. unten)j. Viertens sprechen allgemeine Gründe geschichtlicher und kirchengeschichtlicher Art dafür, daß das Baptisterium zur Zeit Papst Nikolaus II. entstand. Diese von Horn angedeutete Auffassung, über die er weitere Aufsätze ankündigt, habe ich 1935 in einem noch unveröffentlichten Aufsatz entwickelt und diesen Aufsatz seinerzeit Horn zu Verfügung gestellt. Sie wird jetzt in dem Mitt. Inst. Florenz veröffentlicht (Jahrgang 1940). (13) Die Regierungsdaten Rainers sind dessen Grabschrift entnommen (abgedruckt bei Swoboda, Baptisterium, 1918, 4). Dieses Grabmal und das verwandte, 1096 datierbare Grabmal des Grafen Wilhelm Bulgarus, der Cilla und des Uguccione in der Badia a Settimo, sowie die 1093 datierte Fassade der Collegiata in Empoli, – diese ganze sicher datierte Denkmälergruppe aus den neunziger Jahren des 11. Jahrhunderts ist der wichtigste HInweis daruf, daß das ähnlich inkrustierte Baptisterium im späten 11. und frühen 12. Jahrhundert entstanden sein muß. Swoboda hat freilich versucht, einen stilistischen Unterschied zwischen dieser Gruppe und dem Baptisterium zu konstruieren und dadurch das letztere für eine Schöpfung der zweiten Hälfte des 12. Jahrhundert zu erklären. Seine Beweisführung läßt sich aber durch die einfache Beobachtung widerlegen, daß das Grabmal Rainers 1113 vor die bereits fertige Wand gesetzt wurde, und daß die Inkrustationen seines Sockels auf die Basen der angrenzenden Säulen Rücksicht nehmen, daß die Architektur des Erdgeschosses von S. Giovanni, damals also bereits vor­handen war. Das Quadratmuster des Sockels ist auf eine Ausdehnung be­rechnet, die kleiner ist als die Ausdehnung des Sarkophags. Das umgekehrte wäre natürlich. Die Unregelmäßigkeit läßt sich nur dadurch erklären, daß man von vornherein auf die Säule Rücksicht nahm, deren Basis den Platz in der Sockelzone beengte. Vgl. dazu jetzt auch Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 111. (14) Diese Säulen wurden 1117 von den Pisanern aus Maiorca mitgebracht und den Florentinern geschenkt, zum Dank dafür daß sie bei dieser Unter­nehmung gegen die Araber den Schutz der Stadt Pisa übernommen hatten (Giovanni Villani V, cap. XXXI: es standen auch Bronzetüren zur Wahl; Del Migliore, 1684, S. 87). Kugler zuerst vermutete, diese Schenkung sei wohl als Beitrag zur Förderung einer damals in Gang befindlichen, auch in Pisa bekannten Florentiner Bauunternehmung, eben des Baptisteriums, gedacht gewesen (Geschichte der Baukunst II, 58). Diese Deutung bleibt wahrscheinlich, auch wenn die Säulen, wie es geschah, dann nicht eingebaut wurden, was übrigens auch darauf schließen läßt, daß damals das Erdgeschoß, wo sie ihrer Größe nach allein hingepaßt hätten, bereits fertig war (Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 111/112). Sie standen bis 1424 auf dem Platz vor dem Baptisterium (abgebildet auf einer Truhe im Museuo Nazionale), wurden dann von einer Überschwemmung umgeworften, zerbrachen dabei und wurden links und rechts von der eben von Ghiberti neu dekorierten Ostür aufgestellt. Dort sind sie noch heute zu sehen. Vgl. Del Migliore, 1684, 91f.; Rupp, Inkrustationsstil, 1912 8; Swoboda, Baptisterium, 1918, 70; Salmii, Arch. rom., 37. (l5) Dei Migliore (1684., 87) udd Richa (VI, 8) berichten, um 1128 sei das Kathedralrecht von S. Giovanni auf S. Reparata übertragen und S. Giovanni zur Taufkirche gemacht worden. Lumachi (Mem. stor. 1782, 19, 20) machte auf die vermutliche Quelle dieser älteren Autoren aufmerksam: der Senator Strozzi habe in den Büchern der Calimala-Zunft, der Patronin von S. Gio­vanni, gelesen, daß im Jahre 1128 das Taufbecken vom Dom nach S. Gio­vanni übertragen worden sei. Diese Nachricht erklärt sich, wie U. Midde­dorf nachgewiesen hat (unveröffentlichte Festschrift zum 60. Geburtstag von Arthur Haseloff, 1933) weniger im Zusammenhang mit dem Wechsel der Kathedralrechte als im Zusammenhang mit den Bauvorgängen. Offenbar war der Neubau des Baptisteriums 1128 weit genug gefördert, um den zeitweilig in S. Reparata ausgeübten Taufdienst wieder übernehmen ­zu können. Vgl. dazu neuerdings auch die eingehende Untersuchung bei Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 109/110. – Über die Glaubwürdigkeit der Auszüge Strozzis aus den Akten der Calimala-Zunft vgl. die übernächste Anmerkung. (16) Vgl. Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 110. (17) Giovanni Villani berichtet, daß die Laterne 1150 durch die Vorsteher der Calimala-Zunft auf das Gebäude aufgesetzt worden sei (lib. I, cap. LX). Diese Nachricht ist ohne Zweifel zuverlässig. Auch Carlo Strozzi notierte sich in seinen Auszügen aus den seither verlorenen Büchern der Calimala-Zunft dasselbe (Frey-Vasari I, 1911, 328). Vgl. auch Borghini, Discorsi I, 1584, 159, 160, 162, 164 mit falschen Folgerungen; Kommentar bei Richa V, 1757, XI); Del Migliore, 1684, 114 (mit falscher Kritik), Lami, Mon. II, 1758, 943f.; Cavallucci, A. e st. VII, 1888, 9; Nardini, S. Giovanni, 1902, 105; Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, 48; Rupp, Inkrustationsstil, 1912, 80 (mit falschen Ergebnissen); Swoboda, Baptisterium, 1918, 65, 66 (mit zu scharfer Kritik); Beenken, Z. f. b. K., LX., 1926/27, 250f.; Anthony, ARt stud. V, 1927, 105. Genauere Übersicht über alle diese Meinungen jetzt bei Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 104. An der Laterne befindet sich eine Inschrift hagiogaphischen Inhalts, deren Schriftcharakter eindeutig auf eine Entstehung in der Mitte des 12. Jahrhunderts weist (Genaueres be Horn, a. a. O. 104-106). Mit der Laterne wird auch die Inkrustation vollendet worden sein, denn sie wirkt merklich älter als die 1203 datierbare Inkrustation der Apsis (genaue stilkritische Untersuchung jetzt bei Horn, a. a. O., 1938, 108) durch die Tatsache, daß im Jahre 1205, gelegentlich der Übertragung einer Reliquie des Apostels Philippus nach S. Giovanni, der Marmorschmuck des Gebäudes als dessen Hauptruhm bezeichnet wird (Geschichte von Florenz I, 1896, 737; Forschungen z. G. Florenz I, 1896, 146, 461f.; Swoboda, Baptisterium, 1918, 1). Davidsohn und nach ihm Frey (Vasari I, 1911, 580) haben die Worte des Textes von 1205 willkürlich nur auf die Inkrustation des Inneren Bezogen, anstatt auf den ganzen Bau. Daß dieser in seiner heutigen Gestalt wirklich schon um 1150 fertig dastand, bestätig uns auch die Meinung der Chronica de origina civitatis, die bereits im frühen 13. Jahrhundert S. Giovanni als eine Schöpfung aus altchristlichen, also längst vergangenen Zeiten behandelte (Swoboda, 1918, 64). – Die Kuppelkonstruktion scheint sich während des Baus oder blad nach seiner Vollendung als unsicher erwiesen zu haben. Man mauerte deshalb angeblich die Belastungssporen höher udn schwerer auf und verdeckte diese Zufügung mit einem Attikageschoß. So vermutete jedenfalls Supino, ausgehend von der Beobachtung technischer Unterschide an den Sporen, und Salmi stimmte ihm zu (Gli Albori, 1906, 44ff.; Arch. rom. 37) Mir bleibt etwas unklar, wie man sich dann den ursprüglichen Bauplan für das Dach zu denken hat. Infolge der starken Vorwölbung der inneren Kuppelschale würde ein tiefer als heute ansetzendes Pyramidendach seine Spitze beträchtlich oberhalb der heutigen Laterne gehabt hahben müssen, würde also übersteil ausgefallen sein, oder aber die Kuppel würde, wie in Pisa, hindurchgewachsen sein. Beides scheint mir schlecht zu dem strengen Klassizismus des Florentiner Baus zu stimmen. Vielleicht war die Attika also doch von Anfang an geplant und Supinos Beobachtungen müssen anders gedeutet werden. Stilistisch mußte die Inkrustation der Attika ja so­ wieso am meisten entwickelt ausfallen, da sie am spätesten entstand. Die obere Randlieste ist eine Zufügung des 14. Jahrhunderts (vgl. unten). Seit­dem ich diese Zeilen 1934 niederschrieb, hat Horn die Hypothese eines älteren Daches bündig widerlegt (Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 148ff.). (18) Vgl. darüber Wackernagel, Lebensraum, 1938, 24, 200, 218, 220, 221. - Näheres siehe Anm. 19, Schluß. (19) Die ältere Literatur nahm an, der Bau habe als Marstempel ein einziges Portal gehabt, das Westportal, und dieses sei dann samt seiner Vorhalle der Verwandlung in einen christlichen Tempel zum Opfer gefallen; damals sei im Westen die Apsis angefügt worden und damals hätte man die drei Portale im Süden, Osten und Norden eingebrochen (Giovanni Villani, lib. I cap. LV; Vasari I, 334; Borghini, Discorsi I, 1584, 159; Hübsch, Die altchristlichen Kirchen etc. 1862, Spalte 42; Geschichte von Florenz, I, 1896, 737; Forschungen z. G. Florenz, IV, 1908, 461). Borghini, setzte diese Veränderungen als erster in spätere Zeit, und zwar ins Jahr 1150, offenbar unter Mißdeutung der Villani-Nachricht vom Bau der Laterne. (Bocchi-) Cinelli datierte den Vorgang um das Jahr 1200 (1677, 26) und Richa rückte ihn ins Jahr 1202, unter Hinweis auf eine entsprchende, vom Senator strozzi kopierte Eintragung in den Büchern der Calimala-Zunft (V, 1757, XVIII, XXXIII, mit genauem Wortlaut). Vielleicht beruht schon Cinellis Datum auf Kenntnis dieser Ricordanz; vgl. ferner Forschungen z. G. Florenz I, 1896, 146. Die Echtheit der Strozzi-Nachricht ist mehrfach bezweifelt worden. Nardini focht sie aus irrigen stilkritischen Gründen an (S. Giovanni, 1902, 80, 81ff., 84ff., 86, 87, 90, 96, 97; A. e st. VII, 1888, 133). Frey wies darauf hin, daß die Bücher der Calimala-Zunft erst 1207 begonnen wären, und daß Strozzi an anderer Stelle eine nachweislich flasche, dem Vasari nachgeschiebene Behauptungaus derselben, also zweifelhaften, Quelle entnommen haben wolle (Loggia de’Lanzi, 1885, 64; Vasari I, 1911, 328, 329, 578). Ich halte Freys Einwendungen nicht für stichhaltig. Auch wenn die Bücher der Calimala-Zunft erst 1207 begonnen wurden, mag man in sie Erinnerungen an kurz vorher vorgefallene Ereignisse eingetragen haben; und Strozzi kann sehr wohl die knappen Angaben der Baubücher durch “Tatsachen” illustriert haben, die ihm aus Vasari geläufig waren; erst er , nicht seine Vorlage, hat offenbar die irrige Kompilation vorgenommen. Stützen kann man das Datum 1202 auch von anderer Seite her; ein Jahr später wurde dem Baptisteriumeine hochbedeutende Reliquie geschenkt, der Arm des Apostels Philippus (Lumachi, Mem. stor. 1782, 45ff.); sollte der Umbau der Apsis schon damis in Zusammenahng gestanden haben? - Ich halte also das Datum 1202 für zuverlässig und finde es auch durch den Stil der Inkrustation und der Bauskulpturen an der Scarsella, sowie durch das Angansdatum der Mosaiken, 1225, bestätigt (vgl. auch Swarzenki, Rep. f. Kw. XXIX, 1906, 521; und Swoboda, BAptisterium, 1918, 21). Die Apsis ist 1202 freilich nicht entstanden, sondern sie wurde verändert. Sie hatte bis dahin einen halbkreisförmigen Grundriß, wie die Ausgrabungen erwiesen haben (vgl. den Bericht bei Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, 52, 53, 62, tavola IV); durch die Auffindung dieser Fundamente wird Hübsch’s Vermutung, die Scarsella sei keine spätere Zufügung, zum Teil bestätigt (Die altchristlichen Kichen etc. 1862, Spalte 42). Supino nimmt irrtümlichan, die halbrunde Apsis gehöre zum ersten, langobardischen Bau, die Scarsella aber zum Bau des 11. Jahrhunderts. Das wird widerlegt von der durch denselben Autor gemachten Beobachtung, daß die runde Apsis in Verband mit dem inneren, erst dem 11. Jahrhundert angehörenden Mauerring der Fundamente steht. – Richtige Datierung bei Poggi (Riv. d’A. VII, 1910, 77). Swoboda nahm einleuchtend an, man habe die runde Apsis ins Eck übertragen, weil man gewölbte Flächen schwer habe inkrustieren können (BAptisterium, 1918, 69); vgl. auch die irrigen Hypthesen Rupps (INkrustationsstil, 1912, 52, 53) und Salmis (Arch, rom. 35). – Von der Erbauung der Scarsella ist die von den älteren Autoren damis verknüpfte angebliche Einbrechung der drei Portale abzutrennen. Eine solche Maßnahme hat nie stattgefunden. die Portale gehören dem ursprüglichen Bauplan an (vgl. Baubeschreibung und Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 142/43; vgl. auch Anm. 61). – Davidsohn entnahm willkürlich aus Dokumenten des 14. und 15. Jahrhunderts, daß man bei ERbauung der Scarsella im Osten ein neues Atrium angelegt habe; der Wortlaut der von ihm angeführten Stellen beweist, daß es sich um den Domplatz handelte (Forschungen z. G. Florenz IV, 1908, 461). - In der Zeit der Erbauung der Scarsella ist das Vorhandensein der Opera di S. Giovanni unter Leitung eines Operaio Arduinus bezeugt; anscheinend hatte die Calimala-Zunft diese Opera schon 1157 spätestens unter ihren Schutz genommen; möglicherweise handelte es sich dabei um eine Maßnahme der Regierung zur Sicherung der Erhaltung des gerade von ihr fertiggestellen Bauwerks; vgl. über diese Fragen: Frey, Loggia de’Lanzi, 1885, 133; Geschichte von Florenz I, 1896, 737; Forschungen z. G. Glorenz I, 1896, 145, 146; Cocchi, Chiese, 1903, 40; Poggi, Riv. d’A. VII, 1910, 78, 83ff.; Frey-Vasari I, 1911, 328; Salmi, Arte XVII, 1914, 275; Lami, Mon, II, 1758, 1449. (20) 1207 ist der Fußboden von S. Miniato datiert, der &amp;amp;118 derselben Zeit und Werkstatt stammen muß wie der Zodiakus und zugehörige Teile im Fußboden von S. Giovanni; vgl. Swoboda, Baptisterium, 1918, 16f. – Richa bemerkt fälschlich, um 1200 sei am Fußboden gearbeitet worden; damals habe man den Zodiakus umgelegt, der vor 1048 entstanden sei (V, 1757, XXIVf.).

(23) Giovanni Villani berichtet im Buch III, Kapitel 3 seiner Chronik über diese Maßnahme folgendernmaßen: “nel detto tempo si feciono intorno a S. Giovanni i pilastri dei gheroni del marmo per l’arte di Calimala, che prima erano di macigno”. “Gheroni” (= Sporen) sind die dreieckigen Felder des Pyramidendaches, wie Nardini gezeigt hat und wie es der Wortgebrauch der Dokummente über die Dachrestaurierungen des 14. und 15. Jahrhunderts unwiderleglich bestätigt (vgl. Nardini, A e st. VII, 1888, 131 132; vgl. Baugeschichte weiter unten). “I pilastri dei gheroni” sind also die Pfeiler an den Ecken, die die Dachdreiecke stützen. Alle anderen Deutungen sind falsch (vgl. etwa Bocchi-Cinelli, 1677, 27). Vasari deutete den Wortlaut Villanis irrtümlich dahin, daß damals die gesamten Außenwände inkrustiert worden seien, und diese Meinung wirkt bis auf unsere Tag nach (Vasari I, 285f.; Dei Migliore, 1684, 65, 89; Foll.-Rastr. III, 1794, 9; Del Rosso, Ricerche, 1820, 50; Hübsch, Die altchristlichen Kirchen etc. 1862, Spalte 42; Gruyer, Les oeuvres d’art de la Renaissance italienne au Temple de St. Jean, 1875, 25, 26; Geschichte von Florenz I, 1896, 737. – Dagegen vgl. Fantozzi, Guida, 1842, 356; Cavallucci, A. e st. VII, 1888, 9/10; Nardini, S. Giovanni, 1902, 26 ff., 30 ff.; Frey-Vasari I, 1911, 580, etc. etc.). Vasari schrieb die Inkrustierungsarbeiten dem Arnolfo di Cambio zu, und diese Attribution wird durch die Tatsache gestützt, daß Arnolfo in den strittigen Jahren Dombau­meister war, also wohl auch die Opera des dem Domkapitel gehörenden Baptisteriums leitete (Fey, Loggia, 1885, 69; Frey-Vasari I, 1911, 575; anscheinend dem widersprechend die Äußerung in Thieme-Becker II, 1908, 138). Für Arnolfos Urherberschaft spricht auch der pisanische Schichtencharackter der Inkrustation, der dann für die Pfeiler der arnolfianischen Domfassade charakteristisch werden sollte (dagegen äußerte sich Nardini, Il Campanile die S. Maria del Fiore, 52f.). – Unsicher ist die Zeitstellung dieser Arbeiten. Villani nennt das Jahr 1293. Aber Frey weist überzeugund darauf hin, daß man die Pfeiler kaum vor der Beseitigung der Gräber in Angriff genommen haben könne, d. h. nicht vor 1296 (Vasari I, 1911, 575). Über die Beseitigung der Grabmonumente vgl. “Verlorene Ausstattung”. – Sicher falsch ist die lange geglaubte Vermutung, Arnolfo habe einen ursprüglich vorhandenen, dann versunkenen Stufensockel unter dem Gebäude durch ein einfaches Profil erstzt (Del Migliore, 1684, 89). Die Ausgrabungen haben klar erwiesen, daß ein solcher Stufensockel nie vorhanden war. Vgl. die Tafel IV bei Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, und “Rekonstruktion”. Das Sockelgesims scheint aber von Arnolfo erneuert worden zu sein. (24) Giovanni Villani, lib. XII, cap. XLVI. Spogli Strozziani aus den Baurechnungen der Calimala-Zunft: Nardini, A. e st.

II, 1903, 189 Name Misericordia Vecchia (1). Oratorio della Misericordia Vecchia e Capitani del Bigallo (2) Oratorio del Bigallo; commonly, Bigallo (3). See note under Building History (around 1425). Building History Oratorio of the Bigallo (Corner of Via dei Calzaiuoli and Piazza di San Giovanni) (4). The company of the Misericordia, a confraternity, acquired the building in 1321 (5). After they acquired the property through a donation of the adjoining plots in 1351, (6) they began construction of the building in 1352, which contained a loggia, an oratory, meeting hall, and a living room for the brothers of the confraternity (7). By 1358 the building process was completed (8). The design can be, in all likelihood, attributed to the architect Alberto Arnoldi, who also provided the most important three-dimensional fixtures (9). In 1425, under the oversight of Cosimo de’Medici, the brotherhood of the Compagnia della Misericordia united with the original long-time resident of the building, the brotherhood of Santa Maria del Bigallo, jointly receiving the residence of the latter through a co-ownership agreement (10). Constructional changes were apparently not undertaken at that time. A fire in 1442 damaged the upper floor of the building (11). In 1452 the Sala dell’Udienza was expanded through the inclusion of a new room (12). Since the 1700s multiple disfiguring changes to the building were undertaken. In 1698 the arcade of the loggia and the window in the upper floor were walled up (13). After termination of the Bigallo’s management in 1776, the building was given as the site of the administration for the state orphanage and was altered significantly from its original configuration during the restoration (14). Walls were removed from the arcade of the loggia in 1865 and the interior of the oratory was restored then (15). In 1882 the walled-up windows on the upper floors were re-opened (16), and a final restoration took pace in 1904 (17). Building Description Old Descriptions. • The fresco of Niccolò di Pietro Gerini, Restitution of Children, Sala de Consiglio • The predella of Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio, high altar. In the Bigallo itself (see building facilities) • Codex of Macro di Bartolommeo Rustici, mid 15th-century (Photo under the authority [soprintendenza] 7646) • Cityscape by Stefano Bonsignori, 1584 • Illustrations by Mori-Boffito, Piante e Vedute di Firenze, 1926 • Drawing by E. Burci (before 1865) • Exterior view of now walled-up loggia and the same windows • Illustrations in Rivista d’Arte II, 1904, p. 244 Building Images. • Elevation engraving from D. Callesi in Rohault de Fleury, Le Toscane au Moyenage, 1876 Exterior The building abuts the neighboring houses to the south and west. Its northern façade included three niches, with one on the eastern wall. These and the eastern niche of the northern area were designed as a square loggia, which served as exhibition space for foundlings. The two round-arched openings of the porch were framed through two-story pilaster pairs and a cornice; a corresponding system of two-story pilasters and rounded arches were superimposed on two remaining bays in the north wall (18). Each of the bays was articulated with a pointed arch with broad architraves and striated frames; the last bay contained an arched window (19). Above the ground floor pilasters articulate a mezzanine floor, in which naturalistic and picturesque decorations appear. Also, the floor above is articulated by pilasters: on the north wall appear three boxes, one on the east wall; every one of these boxes contains a round arch combined with a bifurcated window. On the pilasters, the springing level of the windows are connected by a shelf and sit carved with volutes furnished by girders which protrude out and are supported by rafters. The Loggia By Alberto Arnoldi (see building history). A highlight of the lavish decorative style, Andrea Orcagna’s famous tabernacle in Orsanmichele would have been well known. Alberto Arnoldi, like Orcagna a sculptor-architect, had incorporated Orcagna’s style during the building’s development. The pillars stand on plinths made of marble slabs, which contain vivid, grooved quatrefoils; in each of the arcade’s openings stands another square marble slab with a rose window of individual work. The outer pilaster pairs are also adorned with quatrefoils; on the inner pillars and the arches the quatrefoils are somewhat bigger and contain half-length figures (see facilities). In the embrasures of the arcade are rotated, ornamental foliate pillars, which continue in the archivolt as a rotated bead molding. The flat pilasters against the arches are ornamented with molding strips; on their starting points appear flat corbels with leaf work (20). The interior of the logger is simpler. The numerous bases run along the thin shelf, where there are also continuous pilasters. Between these are located wide niches, in which are lintels with decorated, screened pointed arches and quatrefoils. The niches are closed with rounded arches; between these arches and the pointed arched ribbed vaults emerge spandrels from each ornamental circle. Interior The oratory belonged to a rare type of large, arched, gothic churches, among them San Jacopo in Campo Corbolini, San Martino della Scala, and San Carlo Borromeo I. There were two pointed, overlaid, ribbed arches, supported by broad and flat, splayed corner panels that compose pilasters. The rose windows in the north wall were extended in 1865 at the same time that the arcade of the loggia had windows installed inside it. Facilities Exterior The entrance hall contains the three-dimensional decorations that were designed by the architect Alberto Arnoldi, who was also a sculptor. These are presented as preserved gems of gothic building decoration, a rarity in Trecento Florence. The execution is often rough, as there were obviously assistants involved in their production. The end products were clearly based on an antiquated taste that derived from gothic prototypes, but were also independent of those traditional forms. Entrance Hall In the quatrefoil of the inner pilaster pairs and the arches of the half-figures; eight prophets appear on the east side. In the vortex of the arcade we see the Man of Sorrows; on the north side are eight angels and the Savior. In the gusset of the arcade appear the four Cardinal Virtues, with Justice and Prudence placed on the north side and Wisdom and Temperance on the east side (21). Assistants produced four pairs of masks with attached leaves that were placed in the niches and the embrasures on the interior of the loggia, close over the cornices. Upper Floors on the North Side Over the loggia stand half life-sized figures produced by a Florentine sculptor in the second half of the 14th century: These stone sculptures represent the Madonna with Child, Saint Peter Martyr and Saint Lucy; (22). The three baldicchini from 1413 have been attributed to Filippo di Cristofano (23). Between these canopies appear frescoes of worshipping angels, probably produced around 1425 (25). In the middle bay sits a bust of the Madonna with Child by Alberto Arnoldi from 1361. Over the blind arcade on either side of the bays appear frescoes depicting Peter Martyr Presenting Banners to Twelve Followers of the Company of the Misericordia and The Miracles by the Preaching of Peter Martyr painted by Ventura di Moro and Russell di Jacopo Franchi in 1445/6; these were very badly destroyed during Gaetano Bianchi’s restoration in 1882 (26). The remaining paint – including the ornaments and the figures in quatrefoils – all came from the restoration of the 19th century. Interior Oratory High altar: A carved tabernacle bears three niches, with the middle ornamentally flanked with two pillars and crowned by a spread architrave and round gables designed and executed by Nofero d’Antonio Noferi (1515) and gilded by Bernardo di Jacopo and Zanobi di Lorenzo (27). The three marble statues by Alberto Arnoldi feature the Madonna with Child and two candlestick—holding angels, all produced between 1359 and 1364 (28). The painted predella by Rodolfo del Ghirlandaio from 1515 contains five pictures: the Death of Saint Peter Martyr, the Birth of Christ, the Cloaked Misericordia, the Flight into Egypt, and the Burial of Tobit (Two Men Carrying a Body, with the Bigallo depicted in the background); (29). In the stained glass in the rose windows of the north wall appears the figure of Caritas, or Charity, from around 1865 (30). Sala del Consiglio (entrance at 1 Piazza di San Giovanni) Wooden door. Inlay (coats of arms of the Brotherhood of the Bigallo and adornments), 1500s (31). South wall. Removed fresco: Restitution of Children by Niccolò di Pietro Gerini and Ambrogio di Baldese, 1386.

On further lost equipment, materials, and facilities, which are no longer in the established locations today, see the documents by Poggi, Rivista d’Arte II, 1904. Notes (1) As the building was named, before the Company of the Bigallo received joint ownership in 1425. (2) Del Migliore, 1684 (3) Richa VII, 1785, 251. The name Bigallo is alleged to have derived from a hospital of this name by Ruballa (spedale di S. Maria a Fonteviva, named del Bigallo), that the Compagnia Maggiora della Vergine knew and then transferred from their residence; see Richa VII, 1758; research on G. Florenze IV, 1908, 426 and History of Florence II, 1908. (4) The History of the Compagnia della Misericordia is often falsely described, where they are confused with the Compagnia del Bigallo, which existed separately until 1425. The Compagnia della Misericordia was first mentioned in documents around 1321 (see the following notes). According to the “Liber Chronicorum” by Saint Anthony (ed. Giunti 1486, Vol III, Part III, Chapter VII, p. 233) this confraternity would have arisen out of the 1292 founding of the Laudese Brotherhood from Orsanmichele; see Passerini, Stab., 1853, 446f., but this is an erroneous assumption, as the company was first mentioned in 1329. Other legendary founding stories are mentioned in the Illustrated Florence, 1847, 49ff. and by Passerini, Stab., 1853, 440 ff.. (5) Poggi, Riv. d’A. II, 1904, 194 note, after the Spogli Strozzi. Richa VII, 1758, 268 dated the donation of property by the early Baldinuccio Adimari, describing the houses from “around 1340.” (6) Document from 9.16.1351 by Poggi, Riv. d’A. II, 1904, 225/6; see also Passerini, Notes., 1853, 448. (7) Document from 1.28.1352 (building beginning) by Poggi, Riv. d’A. II, 1904, 226; unknown by Passerini, Note., 1853, 449/450. (8) By this year, the grids of the loggia had already been manufactured; Document by Poggi, Riv. d’A. II, 1904, 226. (9) Vasari I, 302 named Nicola Pisano as the architect; he followed Landini, Bigallo, 1779, XIII. In contrast, Passerini (1853, 449-450) referred to chronological contradictions and argued that Andrea Orcagna was the architect. Burckhardt, Cicerone, 1860, 145 ascribed it to followers of Orcagna. Frey, Loggia de’Lanzi, 1885, 105 argued against the possibility that Orcagna would have been an influence to the architect of the Bigallo (Tabernacle in Orsanmichele). Frey also thought older components from the building could have been withdrawn; the structures of both western arcades and pilasters reminded him of the similar building styles seen in Santa Maria Novella and Santa Croce, and so he came to the conclusion that the rest of the old oratorio could have been constructed by Arnolfo di Cambio, the architect responsible for Santa Croce (Frey, ibid., 86, 105). In Contrast, Poggi, Riv. d’A. II, 1904, 193/4 believed that the Brotherhood may well have resided in this location as early as 1321 (see Note 5) and that furthermore the construction planning allowed for no elimination of older parts. However, Poggi supported the first of Frey’s opinions, that Alberto Arnoldi had been the builder. Venturi, Storia IV, 1906, 684 attributed the building to Arnoldi, under the influence of Orcagna; Thieme-Becker I, 1907, 218 concurred that Arnoldi was the architect of the Bigallo’s loggia, as did L. Beccherucci, Arte XXX 1927, 214. (10) Del Migliore, 1684, 78; Richa VII, 1758, 267/268 after a writing for the 1700s; Illustrated Florence IV, 1839, 32; Passerini, Stab., 1853, 797; Poggi, Riv. d’A II, 1904, 192, 195. Further research in G. Florenz IV, 1908, 427 wrongly dated to 1452. (11) Poggi, Riv. d’A. II, 1904, 197. (12) Documents by Poggi, Riv. D’A. II, 296. (13) Poggi, Riv. d’A.

(14) Poggi, Riv. d’A II, 1904, 202. (15) Passerini, cur. stor. art. 91; Poggi, Riv. d’A. II, 1904, 202; the works were managed by Mariano Falcini. (16) Poggi, Riv. d’A. II, 1904, 202. (17) Poggi, Riv. d’A. II, 1904, 202; A. e. st. XXIII, 1904, 155. (18) As a precursor to these systems see San Giovannino dei Cavalieri. (19) The windows were expanded in 1865; see Poggi, Riv. d’A II, 1904, 196. (20) It is uncertain if the figures should stand there. (21) The three dimensional decoration were attributed first by Frey, Loggia de’Lanzi, 1885, 105 to Alberto Aroldi; Poggi, Riv. d’A II, 1904, 193, presumed – with justification – that assistants also participated. See also M. Raymond, Gaz. B. A. II, 1893, 322 and Le sculpture florentine, 1897, I, 170f; Venturi, Storia IV, 1906, 684; Thieme-Becker I, 1907, 218. (22) The three statues originate from the old oratory of the Brotherhood of the Bigallo (see Bigallo II) and were transferred there in 1425. They were painted by Ambrogio di Baldese in 1392, see Poggi, Riv. d’A II, 1904, 230/231 (Documents) and 192/193 – the attribution to Nicola Pisano stems from Vasari I, 302 and Landini, Bigallo, 1779, XIII: Milanesi-Vasari I, 302 corrected mistakes about the statues by producing documentation that mentioned them as the works of Filippo di Cristofano (1413); see also Swarzenski, Kunstgeschichte Anz.

IX, 1839, 45 read the date as 1352, so one must assume, this date was probably distorted through a restoration; see Passerini, Stab., 1853, 450ff. and Poggi, Riv. D’A. II, 1904, 203ff.

The representation of the Bigallo on the fresco of Niccolò di Pietro Gerini and Ambrogio di Baldese (now in the Sala del Consiglio) and on the Predella of the high altar by Rid. Del Ghirlandaio unanimously reproduce the grid as a simple network of crossed iron rods. It was cut into rectangular doors; in the arches, the network rested on a crossbeam. (37) Document by Poggi, Riv. d’A. II, 1904, 229. (38) The position of this fresco is not determined exactly; Del Migliore 1684, 80 saw it, “sopra al portone del Ricetto”, Richa VII, 1758, 293 simply says “sopra al portone”; most likely one could expect it on the now-free side that faces them campanile. Admittedly Poggi assumed (see the next note) the lost third Peter Martyr fresco, the origins of which we can not necessarily be certain, was also constructed there. Further literature in Note 32. (39) Outside of the two preserved frescos of this painter (see under “Facilities”) a third is named in a document (see Poggi, Riv. d’A. II, 1904, 241); Poggi speculates that the lost fresco was located over the arcade on the east side. The document continues further, though not necessarily reliably, that this third fresco was completed. (40) Document, payment to Pietro Chellini 1443/44, by Rumohr, Ital. Forsch.

Oratorio della Misericordia Vecchia e Capitani del Bigallo (2) Oratorio del Bigallo; commonly, Bigallo (3). Baugeschichte (c. 1425). Baugeschichte Die Compagnia della Misericordia, eine mildtätige Bruderschaft (4), erwarb 1321 ein Haus an der Südseite der Piazza del Duomo, dem Portal des Baptisteriums gegenüber (5). Nachdem ihr Besitz durch die Schenkung des angrenzenden Grundstückes (an der Ecke der Via de’Calzaiuoli) im Jahre 1351 vergrößert worden war (6), begann man 1352 mit der Errichtung eines Baues, der eine Loggia, ein Oratorium, Versammlungs- und Wohnräume für die Mitglieder der Bruderschaft enthalten sollte (7). 1358 war der Bau bereits voll­endet (8). Als Architekt kann mit großer Wahrscheinlichkeit Alberto Arnoldi bezeichnet werden, der auch die wichtigsten Teile der plasti­schen Ausstattung lieferte (9). Im Jahre 1425 wurde auf Veranlassung Cosimos de’ Medici die ursprünglich an anderer Stelle ansässige Bruderschaft von S. Maria del Bigallo mit der Compagnia della Misericordia vereinigt, indem sie zugleich die Residenz der letzteren zum Mitbesitz erhielt (10). Bauliche Veränderungen wurden damals offenbar nicht vorgenommen. - Ein Brand im Jahre 1442 beschädigte nur das obere Stockwerk des Gebäudes (11). 1452 wurde die “Udienza” durch Einbeziehung eines neuen Raumes erweitert (12). Seit dem 17. Jahrhundert wurden mehrfach entstellende Veränderungen am Bau vorgenommen. 1698 wurden die Arkaden der Loggia und die Fenster im Obergeschoß vermauert (13). Nach der Auflösung der Bigallo-Behörde im Jahre 1776 diente das Gebäude als Sitz der Verwaltung eines staatlichen Waisenhauses und wurde aus diesem Anlaß verständnislos restau­riert (14). 1865 entfernte man die Mauern aus den Arkaden der Loggia und restaurierte das Innere des Oratoriums (15). 1882 wurden dann auch die vermauerten Fenster des Obergeschosses wieder ge­öffnet (16) ; eine letzte Restaurierung fand 1904 statt (17). Baubeschreibung Alte Darstellungen: auf dem Fresko des Niccolò di Pietro Gerini, Rückgabe verlorener Kinder, Sala del Consiglio; auf der Predella des Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio, Hochaltar; beides im Bigallo selbst (vgl. unter Ausstattung). - Kodex des Marco di Bartolommeo Rustichi, Mitte 15.

Burci (vor 1865), Außenansicht mit vermauerter Loggia und ebensolchen Fenstern; Abb. in Riv. d’A. II, 1904, 244. Bauaufnahmen: Aufriß-Stich von D. Cellesi in Rohault de Fleury, La Toscane au Moyenage, 1876. Außen Das Gebäude lehnt sich nach Süden und Westen an die Nachbarhäuser an. Seine Nordfassade umfaßt drei Wandfelder, die östliche eines. Dieses und das östliche Feld der Nordseite sind zu einer quadratischen Loggia ausgestaltet, die als Ausstellungsraum für Findelkinder diente. Die zwei rundbogigen Öffnungen dieser Vorhalle werden durch zweigeschossige Pilasterpaare und ein Gesims gerahmt; ein entsprchendes System, zweigeschossige Pilaster und Rundbögen, ist den zwei restlichen Jochen der Nordwand vorgeblendet (18). Von diesen beiden Jochen enthält das an die Loggia anschließende ein Spitzbogenportal mit breitem Architrav und gequaderter Rahmung; das letzte Joch enthält ein Rundbogenfenster (19). Über dem Erdgeschoß folgt ein nur von Pilastern gegliedertes Zwischengeschoß, das dem plastischen und malerischen Schmuck vorbehalten blieb. Auch das Obergeschoß ist durch Pilaster gegliedert: an der Nordwand hat es drei Felder, an der Ostwand eines; jedes dieser Felder enthäßlt en durch einen Rundbogen zusammengefaßtes Biforienfenster. Auf den Pilastern, die in Kämpferhöhe der Fenster durch ein Gesims verbunden sind, sitzen reich geschnitzte, mit Voluten versehene Tragbalken auf, die das weitvorstehende Sparrendach stützen, Die Loggia. Von Alberto Arnoldi (vgl. unter Baugeschichte). Ein Glanzstück des üppigen dekorativen Stils, den Andrea Orcagna an seinem berühmten Tabernakel in Or San Michele ausgebildet hatte. Alberto Arnoldi, gleich Orcagna ein Bildhauer-Baumeister, hat Orcagnas Stil noch während dessen Entstehung aufgenommen. – Die Pfeiler erheben sich auf einer Sockelbank, deren Marmorplatten lebhaft profilierte Vierpässe enthalten; in den Arkadenöffnung folgt noch je eine etwa quadratische Marmorplatte mit einer Rosette in durchbrochener Arbeit. Mit Vierpässen sind auch die äußeren Pilasterpaare geschmückt; an den inneren Pilastern und den Bögen sind die Vierpässe etwa größer und enthalten Halbfiguren (vgl. Ausstattung). – in der Laibung der Arkaden stehen gedrehte, mit Laubwerk ornamentierte Säulen, die sich in der Archivolte als gedrehter Rundstab fortsetzen. – Die flachen Pilaster neben den Bögen sind mit Profilbändern ornamentiert; an ihren Ansatzpunkten befinden sich flache Konsolen mit Laubwerk (20). Das Innere der Loggia ist schlichter; in Höhe der Sockelbank verläuft ein feines Gesims, das sich auch über die Wandpfeiler hinzieht. Zwischen diesen befinden sich breite Nischen, deren Laibungen mit Spitzbogenblenden geschlossen; der zwischen diesen Bögen und dem spitzbogigen Kreuzrippengewölbe entstehende Zwickel ist mit je einem ornamentalen Kreit gefüllt. Innen. Das Oratorium gehört zum seltenen Typus der gewölbten gotischen Saalkirchen; vgl. S. Jacopo in Campo Corboloni (1311 ff.), S. Martino della Scala (1317 ff.) und S. Carlo Borromeo I (1342ff.). Es wird von zwei spitzbogigen Kreuzrippengewölben überdeckt, die auf breiten und flachen, von abgekanteten Ecksäulen begleiteten Pilastern auflagern. Das Rundfenster in der Nordwand wurde 1865 erweitert; gleichzeitig wure die Arkade zur Loggia hin verglast. Ausstattung Außen Allgemeines. Die plastiche Dekoratin konzentriert sich auf die Vorhalle, die von dem Baumesiter Alberto Arnoldi, selbst einem Bildhauer, zu einem wahren Glanzstück gotischer Baudekoration ausgestaltet wurde, wie es im florentinischen Trecento nicht viele gibt (1352-58, vgl. Baugeschichte). Die Ausführung ist oft etwas derb, gewiß waren Gehilfenhände beteiligt. Die sehr bedeutende Er­findung aber beruht auf einem im Grunde antikischen Geschmack der aus einem gotischen Programm und überkommenen gotischen Formen etwas Selbständiges zu gestalten wußte. Vorhalle. In den Vierpässen der inneren Pilasterpaare und der Bögen Halbfiguren; an der Ostseite acht Propheten, im Scheitel der Arkade der Schmerzensmann; an der Nordseite acht Engel und der Salvator. - In den Zwickeln der Arkaden: die vier Kardinaltugenden; an der Nordseite Gerechtigkeit und Tapferkeit, an der Ostseite Klugheit und Mäßigung (21). Im Innern der Loggia sind an den Laibungen der Nischen, dicht über dem Gesims, vier Paare von Masken mit Blattwerk angebracht, offenbar von anderer Hand als die übrige Bauplastik. Obergeschoß an der Nordseite. Über der Loggia halblebensgroße Steinfiguren, Madonna mit Kind, die Hlg. Petrus Martyr und Lucia; florentinisch, 2. Hälfte 14. Jahrhundert (22). Die drei Baldachine 1413 von Filippo di Cristofano hinzugefügt (23). - Zwischen den Baldachinen Fresken, anbetende Engel, um 1425 {24). - Im mittleren Joch Halbfigur der Madonna mit Kind von Alberto Arnoldi, 1361 (25). - Über den Blendarkaden der beiden westlichen Joche Fresken, Petrus Martyr überreicht Standarten an zwölf Mitglieder der Compagnia della Misericordia; Wunder bei der Predigt des Petrus Martyr; von Ventura di Moro und Rossello di Jacopo Franchi, 1445/46; sehr zerstört und 1882 von Gaetano Bianchi restauriert (26). Die übrige Bemalung - Ornamente und Figuren in Vierpässen - stammt von den Restaurierungen des 19. Jahrhunderts. Innen Oratorium Hochaltar Geschnitztes Tabernakel: drei Nischen, die mittlere überhöht, von zwei Säulen flankiert und von einem breiten Architrav und Rundgiebel bekrönt; von Nofero d’Antonio Noferi, 1515, vergoldet von Bernardo di Jacopo und Zanobi di Lorenzo (27).

Über weitere verlorene Ausstattungsgegenstände, deren ursprünglicher Platz heute nicht mehr zu bestimmen ist, vgl. die Dokumente bei Poggi, Riv. d’A. II, 1904, 225ff., 238ff. Anmerkungen (1) So hieß das Gebaude, bevor die Compagnia del Bigallo 1425 den Mitbesitz erhielt; vgl. Baugeschichte. (2) Del Migliore 1684, 75. (3) Richa VII, 1758, 251. - Der Name Bigallo ist angeblich von einem Hospital dieses Namens bei Ruballa (spedale di S. Maria a Fonteviva, genannt del Bigallo), das der Compagnia Maggiore della Vergine gehörte, zunächst auf diese und dann auf ihre Residenz übertragen worden; vgl. Richa VII, 1758, 255; Forschungen z. G. Florenz IV, 1908, 426ff. und Geschichte von Florenz II, 1908, 294ff. (4) Die Geschichte der Compagnia della Misericordia ist oft falsch dargestellt worden, da man sie mit der - bis 1425 gesondert existierenden - Compagnia del Bigallo verwechselte. Die Compagnia della Misericordia wird erst 1321 urkundlich erwähnt (vgl. die folgende Anm.). Nach dem “Liber Chronicorum” des hlg. Antonin (ed. Giunti 1586, T. III, Parte III, Cap. VII, P· 233) wäre sie aus der 1292 gegründeten Laudesi-Bruderschaft von Or San Michele hervorgegangen; vgl. Passerini, Stab., 1853, 446f., der irrtüm­lich annahm, die Compagnia werde erst 1329 zuerst erwähnt. - Andere, legendäre Gründungsgeschichten im Ill. fior. 1847, 49 ff. und bei Passerini, Stab., 1853, 440ff. erwähnt. (5) Poggi, Riv. d’A. II, 1904, 194 Anm., nach den Spogli Strozz. - Richa VII, 1758, 268 datiert den Ankauf dieses früber dem Baldinuccio Adimari gehörenden Hauses summarisch “um 1340”.

(9) Vasari I, 302 nennt als Erbauer Niccolò Pisano; ihm folgte Landini, Bigallo, 1779, XIII. Dagegen wandte sich Passerini, Stab., 1853, 449-450 mit dem Hinweis auf den chronologischen Widerspruch; er glaubte, Andrea Orcagna sei der Architekt. Burckhardt, Cicerone, 1860, 145 dachte an einen Nachfolger des Orcagna. Frey, Loggia de’Lanzi, 1885, 105 erwog umgekehrt die Mölglichkeit, daß Orcagna von der Architektur des Bigallo beeinflußt worden sei (Tabernakel in Or San Michele). Frey glaubte auch, ältere Be­standteile aus dem Bau ausscheiden zu können; die Gliederung der beiden westlichen Arkaden und Pilaster erinnerte ihn an ähnliche Bauteile in S. Maria Novella und S. Croce, und so kam er zu der Vermutung, dies seien Reste eines alten Oratoriums, das vielleicht von Arnolfo di Cambio erbaut worden sei (Frey a. a. 0. 86, 105). Dagegen wandte Poggi, Riv. d’A. II, 1904, 193/194 mit Recht ein, daß die Bruderschaft sich erst 1321 an dieser Stelle niedergelassen habe (vgl. Anm. 5), und daß außerdem der Baufund keine Ausscheidung älterer Teile zulasse. Auch Poggi vertritt die zuerst von Frey vor­getragene Ansicht, daß Alberto Arnoldi der Erbauer sei. - Venturi, Storia IV, 1906, 684: von Arnoldi unter dem Einfluß Orcagnas; Thieme-Becker I, 1907, 218: ebenso.

Die Darstellungen des Bigallo auf dem Fresko von Niccolò di Pietro Gerini und Amhrogio di Bal­dese (jetzt in der Sala del Consilglio) und auf der Predella des Hochaltares, von Rid. del Ghirlandaio, geben das Gitter übereinstimmend als einfaches Netzwerk aus gekreuzten Eisenstäben wieder. Es waren rechteckige Türen eingeschnitten; in den Bögen ruhte das Netzwerk auf einem Querbalken. (37) Dokumente hei Poggi, Riv. d’A. II, 1904, 229. (38) Die Lage dieses Freskos ist nicht genau zu ermitteln; Del Migliore 1684, 80 sah es “sopra al portone del Ricetto”, während Richa VII, 1758, 293 einfach sagt “sopra al portone”; am ehesten könnte man es an der jetzt freien Seite zum Campanile hin vermuten. Allerdings vermutet Poggi (vgl. die nächste Anm.) dort das verlorene dritte Petrus-Martyr-Fresko, von dem jedoch nicht unbedingt feststeht, daß es auch ausgeführt wurde. Weitere Literatur in Anm. 32. (39) Außer den zwei erhaltenen Fresken dieser Maler (vgl. unter Ausstattung) wird in einem Dokument noch ein drittes genannt (vgl. Poggi, Riv. d’A.

Presumably it is a popular variation of the name of the previously located church, “Saint Michael in Orto”, of which it is said, that this church lay in gardens; this name was officially recorded in 1239 (1) . Another meaning can be found in the accompanying word “Or,” a reference to the granary (Latin horreum), that replaced the older church (2), yet this conjecture is refuted by the appearance of the word “Orto” in 1239, so before the foundation of the granary. Building History A small convent with a church named S. Michaelis in Orto was situated on the site of Orsanmichele; it was designated in 895 as a long-standing endowment of Abbot Peter of S. Silvestro in Nonantola (3) and was established perhaps soon after the foundation of the mother monastery (752), as it was consecrated with the cult of the Lombard national saint (4). The convent remained in the possession of the famous northern Italian Abbot as long as it existed (5). It appears to have had a certain significance in Florentine cultural life during the 9th century (6). In 1046 S. Michele in Orto operated under the administration of a provost (7); The convent possibly no longer existed. In the year 1239 the church was apparently destroyed in a family feud, namely through the fault of Mundaldus Ranutius and other Florentine citizens (8). The city administration seized the new space in the middle of the city in order to renovate a public square (9). A few decades later, in February 1285, they allowed, in that very space, an open hall for the grain market to be put on (10). This building is supposed to have been constructed by Arnolfo di Cambio (11) and was already in use (12). On one of its columns, a Madonna image had been mounted. In 1292 this began to heal a plague in a miraculous way; since then the hall became one of the most important places of worship/cult sites of the city and the seat of a powerful confraternity, that organized regular hymns in honor of the portrait of mercy, and therefore was named “Laudesi” (13). Still, the hall also served through its original secular purpose for a few more decades. In the year 1304, it fell victim, with its whole district, to fire which Ser Neri Abati hat created in the course of a family feud (14). In 1307 they began the construction of the replacement (15). Still unfinished in 1308, this second hall appeared to be not very solidly advised (16). Already in 1321 it threatened to collapse and needed to be repaired (17). The same repeated once again in 1332 (18). Potentially the flood of 1333, during which the water stood two cubits high in the hall (19), accelerated the deterioration of the building once again. In any case, in 1336 the government found in due form, that the hall, because of its small size, could not preserve the volume of stored grain well, and furthermore the hall downright constituted an eyesore in the cityscape; it probably should, as they determined, develop a new hall in its place, and a more proper palace to be sure, big enough to store the grain better and to provide the cult of the miraculous Madonna image a worthy setting, beautiful enough to do honor to the city; at once a commission was started in order to put the new building into operation (20). On July 29th of the following year ceremonial laying of the foundation stone took place in the presence of all of the public authorities; it was determined at once, that over the yet to be created mercy-painting –“Oratorium,” two floors with arched ceilings would be built as granaries, and two years later, that the guilds (as contributors to the city government) would have put up their patron saints on the new palace, in such a way that each column of the hall would be adorned with a saint (21). That magnificent landmark of the Florentine community, that arose here in the decades of work after that and always is admired as one of the most perfect monuments of Florentine Gothic and Renaissance, had already been planned with full awareness of its complete scope. Who provided the design for the new building and thereby initiated a new age in the development of the Florentine Gothic, is unknown. The painter Taddeo Gaddi, to whom Vasari attributes this merit, comes into consideration (22), not Andrea Orcagna (23). Futhermore, Neri di Fioravanti, Benci di Cione, and before all Francesco Talenti, whose later buildings and school of buildings, the cathedral and the Loggia de’Lanzi, yield a logical development of style from Orsanmichele, come into question (24). The building owner was as representative of the city government guild of the silk weavers (25). The structure must have been funded rather quickly in the first year. Already beginning in 1339, parts of more than ten columns stood, and the rest should have followed immediately (26). – In the fall of that year and in the year 1342, the government allocated additional funds for the building (27). In 1343 it founded a St. Anne Cult dedicated to Orsanmichele in order to hold the day of the eviction of the Duke of Athens in solemn memory. At the time one apparently decided, to whom to give the begun market hall floor of the new structure the character of a church to the greatest extent (28). Soon after, the work appears to have become gradually slower and finally came to a halt during the plague of 1348. “The columns stand finished, adorned with their frescos, the scaffolding for the vault was constructed, and if the money to complete the building isn’t approved, all that has been completed will of necessity deteriorate,” told vividly and imploringly by the silk guild on 19. April 1350 as they sought the support of the city government (29). It must have really stimulated the operation again. Shortly thereafter, the order of an expensive tabernacle for the miracle-working Madonna image was made; it indicates, that they surely reckoned with an early completion of the church, and already in April 1357 the vault appeared to be finished (30). Around the same time (1361), the government transferred the grain market away from the Piazza di Orsanmichele, in order to ensure a dignified surrounding for the nearly finished Tabernacle (31). In doing so, a broader, more significant step in the gradual conquest of the building for the cult was done. The complete obliteration of all traces of the originally intended, secular purpose was decided in 1366, while the construction of the upper, also to the grain-storage-intended rooms under the direction of Benci di Cione proceeded slowly (32). At that time the superintendents agreed to lattice the arcade of the bottom floor through tracery and therefore to transform the open hall into a closed church (33). In the same year, the care of the altar service was taken from the monastic order, who dealt with it in a predetermined, regular cycle, and appointed a specially assigned a sacristan to carry out this task (34). On 2. April 1367 (after the others on 11. April 1366) two traceries were begun, and they appointed Simone di Francesco Talenti to complete these test pieces he had begun, but then was ordered to await further instructions from the building authority (35). Any talk of a continuation of work came again only in 1378 and 1380. Simone di Francesco Talenti pops up again as the senior architect; Antonio di Francesco, Giovanni di Buonafede, Leonardo Masi, Matteo di Cione, and Lorenzo di Filippo were named as executive, and apparently clumsy stone masons who were repeatedly forced to provide compensation for botched work (36). In 1380 the insertion of the tracery in the arcade was finally able to arrive, because in this year the talk is of the relocation of the windows (37). – At that time/then it was decided thus probably even already, to close the gothic tracery in the arcade with walls (38). Still, the middle opening remained open in the middle arcade of the two long sides and preserved in this — until the year 1770 (39). In 1380 the completion of the construction of the upper floors of the palace was approaching. At that time marble was acquired, probably for the State windows (40), and worked into the roof (41). The acceleration of work shortly before 1380 would like to related to, that in 1379 the Laudesi-Brotherhod delegated the construction management role to the silk guild (42). Around 1380, the church was therefore essentially as it is preserved today, but there remained some detail work to complete. In 1384 a tenth of the revenue of the brotherhood was specified for the continuation of construction; 1397 new donations (43). In 1404 the cornice of the palace was drafted (44). In 1408 and 1410, Niccolò di Piero Lamberti completed the perhaps already earlier begun work on the two main doors; his stake is no only clearly defined (45). In 1415 a collegiate church was established in the church (46). Around 1480 it was temporarily secularized (47). It never suffered any serious changes. In 1569 the upper floor of the palace was configured as a state archive (48) and was connected with the opposite administrative building of the wool weavers’ guild through an overpass over the street, allegedly by Bernardo Bountalenti. In 1628 the right, southern main door of the façade was bricked over (49). In 1770 they were bricked over in the mean time in the lower part of the central openings in the middle arcades of both sides; Concurrently, a sacristy was installed in the left, northern, choir (50). In 1821 the tympanum under the connecting arch was removed, and in 1858 again restored (51). In 1852 ff. the decorative parts of the arcade were replaced to a large extent (52). In 1901 a new Restoration took place (53). In 1931 ff. the flooring in the two front bays of the Oratorium, that later had been raised to a higher level than the last (choir) bay, was changed back into its original condition, and the sacristy addition was removed. Reconstruction of Lost Building Elements Church and Cloister of S. Michaelis in Orto. About the Carolingian cloister building of the 8th or 9th century it is only known, that it included a workshop for wool weavers (54). The church had become small, since the convent consisted of only a few nuns (In 885 there were 6 sisters). The First Granary; 1285, by Arnolfo di Cambio (?). More delicate natural stone building with ten columns (55). – The column with the famous miraculous image (see under page 499 “The Miraculous Image and Its Tabernacle”) was housed in a small wooden structure already in 1294, so that the devout viewers could shelter (it) against the evening air (56). Whether a remnant of this column still exists (in the current miraculous image tabernacle) remains to be seen; to that end, see page 499 f. The Second Granary; 1308 ff. It was significantly smaller than the modern building (57) and had thin, poorly engineered brick piers (58). The miraculous image [hung] on one of the columns; whether a remnant of this column was preserved (in the current miraculous image tabernacle) remains to be seen; to this end, see page 499 f. Building Description The Basic Concept Building Record Drawings from Giorgio Vasari JD, Uffizien, Nr. 4784 und 6158-71. — Floorplan, vertical plan, cutaway drawings, details, etc. by Rohault de Fleury, La Toscane au moyenâge, I, 1870, and by Mazzanti-Del Lungo, Raccolta delle migliori fabbriche etc. 1876, LXXXVI ff. (59). Type The building concept of Orsanmichele is a rarity; in it the architectural types of the market hall, the granary, and the confraternity oratory are combined into one entity, which could come about only through the concurrence of entirely special, historical circumstances (60). The ground floor — begun as a market hall — is a vaulted colonnade; it was originally open and after a change in plans was converted into a closed church interior through the walling-up of the outer arcades (61). Above rises two high upper floors erected as granaries (62). The originally intended dichotomy between the open colonnade and the above ambitious tower-house-like “apartment building” of the storage floors must have appeared very strange. Mechanics The whole building is from gray-yellow sandstone (Macigno); only the colonettes of the windows of the upper floors are of white marble. The mechanics of the ashlar rectangular building matured here into a technical achievement that remained unrivaled in Florence during the gothic era (63). Among other things, the stone masons, with visible pleasure at the performing mastery of their ability here, have invented ingenious mechanisms like for example that chute in the northwestern corner pier, though which the grain of the storage facility above could be poured into the market hall below very easily (63a). Exterior Only the part of the building that the church comprises — the ground floor — is described here. Floor Plan Rectangular, facing from West to East. — Structure. Its parts emerged in four different building periods based on four different plans: The Structural Framework originates from the first building phase, that wanted to propose an open market hall (1337-57). It stems from a round-arched column balustrade of massive weight (See Note 71). On the four corners stand four corner piers, between them six intermediate piers, and on the narrow sides of the building (on the west and east) each on the long side, each two. The intermediate piers are rectangular, their edges beveled. The corner piers consist of two half-columns, rectangular, slightly-longer, correspondingly formed half-columns; the two west ones are longer than the two east ones. The rounded arches over the piers have beveled edges (See Note 71). Stonework; around 1366-80 and subsequently applied in the column balustrade; principle work of Simone di Francesco Talenti – the richest stonework composition of the Florentine Trecento, opulently late gothic (64). Each single arcade is organized in the following way. In them rise two narrow pillars out of bundled together colonettes, and on the flat side of the bordering piers there are corresponding half posts. Through which three openings are divided; the middle served as the entrance originally, and the two outside ones were obstructed, and embellished through thin stone barriers with shallow relief, decorated band work (65). Above the strikingly naturalistic post-capitals, that are decorated with leaves and rose-like blossoms, the original tracery arises as filling of the large rounded arch of the arcade. From each capital to the next spans a half-circle arch; these arches cross one and other and create pointed arches through them, for each, one or the other, of the above described three openings; in each pointed arch a rounded arch, in each rounded arch, a multifoil arch. In the six spandrels, that are there, bigger and smaller rosettes are used and framed with branch work and foliage. The Fillings. Light brick walls close the three openings in each large arcade between the tracery of Simone Talenti. The two side openings have been closed since 1380, the middle since 1770 (66). The Door. The filling of the two arcades on the west side of the church is built to correspond to the filling of the other arcades (see above), probably also done according to the plan of Simone di Francesco Talenti. Yet the (somewhat broad) space contains in each here, between the two posts, a stately late-gothic ashlar entrance, seemingly designed by Niccolo di Piero Lamberti (1408/10). Above the door opening there is an architrave, and above that there is an arch, and above that the gothic ornamental gable of complicated flamboyant-late gothic form (67). System. A column hall of two aisles and three bays, bordered on the outside by the above described round colonnade and filling wall (68). In the central axis exists two free piers, square with polygonal corner elements. Corresponding with them — constructed analogously – as copies of the doublewide outer piers are four quarter-piers in the four corners, two half-piers on each long side, and one half-pier on each small side of the hall. The bays are nearly square. Above each spans a cross ribbed vault; the transverse arches are as wide as the pier sides, and flat and smooth, the ribbings of the column pilasters are correspondingly polygonal; the transverse builds semicircular arches, that the ribbings segment. Between the otherwise elongated corner piers of the entrance wall, in which there are spiral stairs which lead to the upper level, and behind the door there two niches with barrel vaults. Meaning Orsanmichele is one of the more perfect creations of the Florentine Trecento architecture and evolutionarily highly important: in this school of architecture the most important efforts of the first Gothic century of Florentine architecture were summarized and interpreted with ingenious creativity, that from the old ideas grew a new idea of beauty. The interior design was the last fulfillment of these efforts toward hall-like expanse and calm, which was triggered by the architecture school of S. Maria Novella (69). Here the purest form of the hall form was reached. The hall was almost as wide as it was long (70). The two naves were very wide and not very tall. The well-proportioned quadrangle is the base form of every single bay. From this finely tuned harmony of all these motives, there is a harmony of space. This harmony is even more apparent, in that the construction form and elements with creative fantasy that matched the bays. Apparently with well calculated intentions, in the place of the gothic pointed arch, what appears is a rounded arch, and with it, in place of a form that points beyond itself, the form remains enclosed within itself (71). Above all however, the newly built pier-type for Orsanmichele serves as the new beauty ideal. Its form can be interpreted two ways: either as rectangular with service on the beveled corners. (see above) or as cross form with corner pilasters in the corners between atrophied cross arms; in this very clear dualism there is the possibility of interpreting them as a gothic as well as a pre-gothic schemata. In any case, this possibility unites in a highly perfect and convincing way, the gothic logic of the bunded limb piers of S. Maria Novella with the Italian simplicity of the square pillars of the Arnolfini Badia (72). The pier of Orsanmichele has at the same time a clear structure that exemplifies the pier of S. Trinita, that means a high, clearly-placed base and a high capital, whose rich acanthus band rings it, also connected to the corner pier. In the surfaces of these piers, gothic arch panel and hexagons are etched, very shallow and delicately (on each of the four sides of each panel and above them a hexagon); like on the building of Arnolfo and Giotto (73). These flat ornamental shapes emphasized subtly the harmony of well-proportioned flat surfaces, that emerged from the structure here. Despite all of this refinement, with all of its piers and arches and really all the forms in Orsanmichele, they still have a splendid gravity. Their impact unites with the calm harmony of the room into the overall effect of high monumentality and a very special tone. Decor Like the building concept, the décor of Orsanmichele is as important as the building concept. Outside and inside there is a series of masterworks of sculpture from the 14th to 16th centuries, among which are the best-preserved series of monumental statues in Florence. Inside there is also a fresco cycle and a series of stained glass – both from the era of about 1400. Exterior The Décor of the Arcade The tracery from Simone di Francesco Talenti (c. 1366-80) is described above (p 487). Statues On each of the above described tracery posts are two figurines, one inside, one outside, so that the structure is surrounded by a wide row of statues of apostles, prophets, and saints. Almost all were replaced around the middle of the 19th century; the few preserved originals were kept in the Museo Nazionale (Bargello) (74). They have a very idiosyncratic, tense, emotional style. It is possible that around 1366-80 they were chiseled by Simone di Francesco Talenti himself. Reliefs In the wall filling of the arcade there are fifteen reliefs which were embedded later. Each represents a half figure—the twelve apostles, two evangelists (Luke and Mark) and a virtue (Veritas). They were initially intended for another purpose. They are ascribed to the Pisan Giovanni Balducci and his workshop and dated around 1336/38. Together with that, a relief of a prophet is embedded right from the group of the Quattro Coronati on the north wall, perhaps an early work of Nanni di Banco, in the beginning of the 15th century (76). The Niche Statues As a Whole. Soon after the beginning of the new building (1339), the silk guild suggested that the foremost guilds to the honor of the Madonna image, should decorate the pillars to the honor of their patron saint and should establish a ritual to these statues (77). The first guilds that decorated their posts with tabernacles and statues were the wool weavers, the silk weavers (1339/40), and the cloth dealers (end of 1340) (78). After a long period (1399), the guild of artists and apothecaries followed first with a Madonna (79). In 1401 the guild of judges and notaries decided to have their patron sculpted in stone (80). They delayed, but the execution, like the entire undertaking, they progressed slowly. In the following year (1402) the Laudesi-Brotherhood sped up the pace of things and they provided the promised honoring to their Madonna image. They had a niche made at their own expense, and having done that, a guild wanted to put there statue inside (81). Also, in 1402, the new congress of guilds developed new regulations for the decorating of niches with guild coats of arms and reliefs (81a). In 1403 the Judges and Notaries commissioned their patron saint (81). But the plan could only be carried out, with a new stronger admoniton of the implementation order. The government had to administer the old plan; on April 22, 1406 they determined, within ten years every guild will have to exhibit their patron saint, if they do not want to give up their niche (83). Finally, the work flowed. In the course of the net twenty years, all of the missing niches were decorated with statues and two of the existing older statues were replaced with more modern statues. The 1406 regulation manifested itself in Renaissance art for the first time wonderfully and programmatically at the hands of the first sculptors of Florence. The single remaining Trecento figure in that place had to be replaced by a modern statue in the early Cinquecento. Even the oldest figure in the new series was replaced in the late Cinquecento, so that there was no gothic tone to disturb the Renaissance harmony. One of the most beautiful Donatello statues (St. Ludwig) fell victim to politics and was replaced by a masterpiece by Verrocchio (83a). Niches In summary, building records of the interesting niches by Mazzanti-Del Lungo, Raccolta delle fabbriche migliori etc. di Firenze, 1876, LXXXXI ff. (84). West Façade Northern Corner Pier. In the marble niche of banking guild there is a bronze statue of the Apostle Matthew, dated to 1420. Niche and figure were produced by Lorenzo Ghiberti with the help of Michelozzo and the stone masons Jacopo di Corso and Giovanni di Niccolò (85). The niche is an interesting example of the transitional style (86). The statue is the most important figure from the hand of Ghiberti. On the Tabernacle, there are two marble statues, Mary and the angel of the Annunciation, in the style of Michelozzo or of Piero di Niccolò Lamberti, around 1420/30; the head of Mary is presumably new (87). Middle Pier Between the doors. Marble niche of the guild of weavers, around 1339/40 (88). Inside there is a bronze statue of St. Stephan by Lorenzo Ghiberti, 1427/28 (89). Southern Corner Pier.

East Façade Southern Corner Pier. Marble niche of the Cloth Guild, produced by the stone mason Albizzo di Pietro, the painter-architect Giuliano d’Arrigo named Pesello (Mosaic) and the glass worker Bernardo di Stefano based on a design by an unknown artist, 1412-14 (100). Inside, a bronze statue of John the Baptist by Lorenzo Ghiberti; signed and dated 1414 (101). Middle Pier. Marble niche, one of the oldest monuments of Renaissance architecture, made for the Guelf Party by Donatello, perhaps with the help of Michelozzo (?), 1418-1425 (102); The shell niche is framed by two spiraling fluted ionic columns and an arch enclosed in a tabernacle with to pilasters and a triangular pediment. In the pediment there is a three headed symbol of the trinity (or Prudentia ?), the emblem of the Guelf party (102a); on the architrave there are angel heads and a garland; in the spandrel, naked figures; on the pediment corners, two masks, between which the antique motif of two putti, that carry a wreath. Under this, there is a double frieze, possibly added by Verrocchio after 1463. In the niche, a bronze group shows doubting Thomas touching the side wound of Christ, the masterpiece of Andrea del Verrocchio, made for the merchant’s guild, that applied for the niche in 1463; 1465-1483 (103). Above it a tondo of glazed Terracotta with a lily, which is the coat of arms of the court, by Luca della Robbia, 1463 (104). North Façade Eastern Corner Pier. Marble niche of the guild of butchers, around 1401/20 (?), by a master under the direction of Donatello and of Nanni di Banco (107).

Inside, a marble group, the “Quattro Coronati,” that means the holy martyrs Kastor, Symphorian, Nikostratus, and Simplicius, by Nanni di Banco, around 1410/11 (?) (111). Above that, the coat of arms of the guild in glazed terracotta by Luca della Robbia, around 1455/60 (112). Western Corner Pier. Marble niche of the armorers (113); in the pediment relief representation, half figure of God the father; on the pedestal, a relief with a dragon battle of St. George; both by Donatello. In the niche, a bronze statue of St. George; A copy of the marble original of Donatello, that was transferred into the Museo Nazionale in 1891; Original from around 1417 (114). Interior Statues in the arcade-tracery, in the style of Simone di Francesco Talenti, around 1366-80; see above page 491 and note 74. The Paintings History. Even before the vaults were brought in, a few frescos could be seen on the piers (115). But just after the end of the construction, it appeared that the painting began to be energetically continued. In 1387 a fresco arose on the door frame. In 1397 the government empowered the Laudesi-Brotherhood, and in the following three years, they slid certain sums of money to them for the decoration of the vaults and the walls (116). In 1403 the painters were working on this (117). The work appeared to stretch into 1408 (118). This oldest fresco cycle was not, as Vasari suggested, by Jacopo del Casentino (119), but rather by several masters of the traditional style, among which Niccolò die Pietro Gerini and Ambrogio di Baldese were named in the first incomplete but published documents (120). The Decoration, like the statue series on the façade in the 15th and 16th centuries, had to be adjusted in line with High Renaissance taste. A few of the most important parts were covered with paintings and wood paneling (see under “Lost Construction”). In 1770 they painted over the vault and a part of the piers (121). In 1864 one of the first vault surfaces was uncovered by Gaetano Bianchi (122); In 1893-95 Dario Chini completed that work (123). Since then, for the most part one can see the frescos, all be it a bit of an overpainted condition. Many are very damaged or entirely disappeared. In 1934/35 they got rid of the paintings that were carried out on the wood panels on the columns and on the sacristy-construction in the north east and they uncovered several places of more frescos. System. A unified program underlies the decoration. The vault-caps, the transverse arch intrados, the flat decorative niches in the piers, and the wall space in the arcades held decorative figures, all of the other surfaces, especially the ribs and the front of the piers, were supposed to be enlivened with ornaments. The long, narrow pointed arch niches on the piers enticed them to affix standing holy figures; on the six-sided surfaces above them are recorded scenes from the legends of the these holy figures, because they did not want these under the feet of the figures in the predella way. Because of the import of the objects must there must be an exhaustive description here; indeed at least the greatest figures on the vaults and the piers have to be listed. We begin with the vault, follow with the wall piers from the main entrance going from the right and end with the free piers in the middle of the oratory. Each letter (a, b, c, d) marks a different pier side. Vault. In each cap, there is an existing frame of blue, gold stared background: patriarchs, ancestors of Jewish heritage, prophets, male and female saints. On the transverses arch over the portal, on every third row of standing and sitting figures, on each of the transverse arches over the arcade of the outer wall, each a row of enthroned saints, and on the rounded arches in the inside half figures in quatrefoils; the artist who carried this out, was closely affiliated with the circle of Spinelllo Artino, but also had a close connection to the painters associated with Giovanni dal Ponte und Bicci di Lorenzo. The cycle was built from 1397 to 1401 (124). Wall Piers and Wall Filling The frescoes, when otherwise not noted, are by unknown painters around 1400. Northwestern Corner Pier: without frescos; former door to the upper floor. – Wall piers between the doors: a) holy bishop b) St. Stephen c) St. Michael, dated 1387 (?), d) John the Baptists (?).

Above these saints in a six-sides field: glorification of St. Mary Magdalene, by Andrea del Sarto, beginning of the 16th century (131). The relevant fields on the other side were also painted with scenes (no longer distinguishable). Eastern Pier: a) St. Bartholomew, under his torture, above his glorification; around 1400? B) St. Lawrence, under his torture, above field indistinguishable; around 1400? C) the good theif on the cross; with inscription (132). D) St. Mary Magdalene; attributed to Giovanni dal Ponte, beginning of the 15th century (133). The Stained Glass History. Together with the frescos, a series of stained glass was carried out, that was intended to decorate above the arch field above the painted wall filling and above the doors of the wall arcade. Already in 1380 were payments were made for the leading (134). From 1394 to 1401 the heads of the brotherhood payed money toward the decorating of the frescoes and the stained glass. The stained glass panels were put up in the following ten years. They are among the most beautiful in Florence. Possibly, Agnolo Gaddi, Niccolòl di Pietro Gerini and Ambrogio Baldesi, who were the creators of parts of the frescos that were being worked on at the same time, were involved with providing designs for the stained glass. Besides these artists, also L. Monaco and perhaps Ghiberti (135). Program. Scenes from Maria’s life and the miracles of the Madonna, especially the miracle-working Madonna, whose attribution is not really possible (136), are represented in irregular form. In the two anterior bays in each wall-arcade, only the middle tracery-arch field is furnished with stained glass; in the third, backmost bay, that served as the choir for both main altars, each wall arcade has arch area tracery with stained glass. The smaller tracery fields above the already described large tracery arches, contain in every arcade a stained glass painting, and namely heads and ornaments. West Side (Entrance Side). First (Northern) Arcade: Angel (very much destroyed), before 1400. Second Arcade: Angel, around 1860. South Side First Arcade Offerings in the temple; in the style of Agnolo Gaddi, around 1385 (?) (137). Second Arcade: Assumption of the Virgin, by Agnolo Gaddi (?) around 1385 (?) (137). Third Arcade: Three wonders of the Madonna Orsanmichele (right on the inside of this, is the miracle-working Madonna, on the left the gallows scene, and on the left the tabernacle with the miracle-working Madonna and pilgrims); maybe after the design of Agnolo Gaddi, around 1390 (?) (138). East Side First Arcade: Two miracles of the Madonna (Salvation of the soul of a pious man and snow wonder of S. Maria Maggiore in Rome) and Rest on the Flight to Egypt; especially beautily work; the Rest on the Flight perhaps after the design of Agnolo Gaddi or of a related artist (139), the salvation of the soul perhaps after the design of Lorenzo Monaco; all three windows from around 1400/1410 (14). Second Arcade: three miracles of the Madonna (the right and the middle scenes very destroyed and partially restored, left healing of the sick); the left scene perhaps after the design of Lorenzo Monaco, executed by Niccolò della Magna (?), around 1400/10 (141). North Side First Arcade Three miracles of the Madonna (ship miracle, Bishop’s miracle, and Grotto miracle); the right and the middle scenes probably done by a miniature painter; beginning of the 15th Century (142). Second Arcade: A proclamation of Joachim; especially beautiful work, perhaps from the concept of Lorenzo Monaco, maybe from the circle that created the Ghiberti window in the cathedral (done by Niccolò della Magna?) around 1410/15 (143). Third arcade: Presentation of Mary, perhaps after a concept of a painter from the circle of Agnolo Gaddi, around 1375/80 (?) (144). The Miracle-Working Madonna and its Tabernacle In the southeastern (right rear) corner bay of the interior. History. On a pier of the granary from 1285 there was a Madonna image; whether it was a fresco or a panel is uncertain (145). Varsari named its creator as Ugolino da Siena (146). In honor of the Madonna image, a confraternity was founded on August 10, 1292, that created itself after the example of the Laudesi-Brotherood in S. Maria Novella especially in the fact that they made it their mission to sing artistic hymns (147). Shortly before their founding, on July 3, 1292, the Marian image miraculously began to heal the sick (148). Therefore, the brotherhood of the them grew conveniently, although the Dominicans and the Franciscans, in the best interest of their own brotherhoods, made life difficult for the brotherhood (149). Regarding a small wooden structure on which the pier with the Madonna image was secured in 1294, see page 485 and Note 56. Whether it survived the fire of 1304, or whether it was replaced at that time with a copy, or whether Ugolinio of Sienna just then delivered the Madonna image, is unknown (150). Copies of these two (?) oldest paintings are not verifiable (151). While these points are still controversial, the opinion that was popularized in the 17th century prevails today, that the current miracle-working Madonna was neither the work of Ugolino nor the hypothetical panel of 1304, but rather a creation from the middle of the 14th century (152). One party considered it a creation of Orcagna (153), the other, the side that finally won out, consider it a work of Bernardo Daddi, who in 1347 verifiably painted a Madonna image for the brotherhood of Orsanmichele (154). The Miracle-Working Image. Large panel: enthroned Madonna and child, adored by eight angels; by Bernardo Daddi; Masterpiece from his late period, 1347; restored 1938/40; well preserved (154). The Tabernacle. Masterpiece of Andrea Orcagna, inscribed and dated 1359 (155). For the Madonna of Daddi, a sumptuous tabernacle was planned, as soon as the brotherhood overcame the legacy of the 1348 plague and had more means at their disposal (156). In 1349 the contract was granted to Orcagna (157). The work was apparently begun in 1352 (158). In 1360 the composition of the complicated structure was apparently still underway (159). The Architecture (160). The square ciborium is made of white marble. Above a stepped-foundation (161) arises a quite high base floor, on each of the four corners there is a correspondingly high pier base; on the four walls there are large octagonal and small hexagonal decorative fields (alternating with each other), that are filled with reliefs. Above that is the main floor, an open structure with four corner piers, four of these carried round arches and a cross ribbed vault; it is sealed from behind through quite thick wall filling, on whose front side there is a miracle image and on whose backside there is a large relief; whether in the inner part of this wall filling is a remains of the original miraculous image has to be further investigated, that is the remains of the specific pier from the first and second granary; Above the arch apex of the main floor there is a horizontal frieze. Above that, there arises the crowning: on each corner there is a pinnacle, on each side a gable in the form of a nearly isosceles triangle, in the middle a high, thin, pointed, melon dome with finials on the edges. Gothic tendencies become clear only in these crowing forms. The main part of structure has the peaceful, powerful relationship of the surrounding church room. The appearance of the rounded arch and the high pier step on it reveals that Orcagna borrowed his architectural thoughts from it. The pier framework of the tabernacle – square with three twisted columns before the beveled outer corners and the same column pairs are in the openings under the arches – enhances the corresponding motif of the surrounding monumental building in the celebratory way, that the specific purpose of the tabernacle requires. For the same reasons, the enclosure is most luxuriously decorated. All the sides that are related to the enclosure are decorated with marble reliefs, encrusted with red and black marble ornaments and inlaid with red, blue, and gold glass. The capitals were marked with ionic blossoms and volutes, for which there were no precursors in the monumental structures of the past. Also, gilding is richly used. With the expense of all previously known means of art and with creative fantasy, Orcagna has created a wonder of trecento decorative art in Florence. The Sculptures. Extraordinarily rich program in the style of the cycles on the pulpits of Niccolò and Giovanni Pisano and on the ciboria of Arnolfo di Cambio, however one of the goals of the miraculous image tabernacle is to correspond with the glorification of Mary. Base. Mary’s life is told on the four walls in eight octagonal reliefs; in the north (left) Mary’s birth and Mary’s presentation, in the west, the wedding and the proclamation, in the south, the birth of Christ and the worship of the kings, in the east the presentation of Christ in the temple and the death proclamation to Mary. In this Mary-cycle, an episode of the presentation of the virtues is engaged; Between every two of the mentioned octagonal reliefs, there is a on the north, west, and south side, there is a heptagon with a relief figures of each virtue (Fides, Spes, Caritas); on the backside there is a half figure of a manly saint. (perhaps a prophet?). The virtue series continues with the half figure reliefs on the pier base. On the middle corner field of each base there is each cardinal virtue (together four), on the lateral field next to it, two other virtues (all together eight), and on the once again protruding lateral corner field of each pier base, there are two manly half figures, probably prophets or ancestors of Mary (together eight). Main floor. Above the capitals of the colonettes on the corner pier there are twelve apostle statues; in the spandrel of the arches on the front side and on the flanks there are angel heads; on the frieze half figures of angels and saints. Around the miraculous image there is a marble curtain that is pulled back by angels. Behind it, the backside of the tabernacle is filled by a many-figured relief: the death of Mary and above the handing down of the belt to the apostle Thomas; under the figures on the deathbed of Mary there is a self-portrait of Orcagna (Man with a cowl, to the right), the oldest still existing, reliably identified realistic art self-portrait in western Christian art (162). Crowning. On the top of each ornamental gable and on the dome, each an angel statuette. – The Question of Masters. The sculptures can only be attributed in small part to Orcagna. Ghiberti reports, the master singlehandedly carried out the narrated representations (163). Vasari thinks, that all the figural representations can be traced to Organa and “his brother”, which the ornamental can be attributed to help from many different lands (164),. K. Steinweg assumed that most of the reliefs were designs of Orcagna and the participation of various help, and the death of Mary and the wedding and the proclamation take them completely out of the realm of having been done alone (165). Meaning. The reliefs of the tabernacle are the most important monument of Florentine sculpture between Andrea Pisano and Donatello. They combine the style of the oldest baptistery door with the spatial construction and the feel for human bodies of Giotto-esque painting and laid the ground for the Renaissance development in decisive ways (166). The ornamentation is largely without precursor. Capitals like the flower-decorated fluted capitals of the corner columns do not exist in Florentine gothic anymore than does the splendid foliage and the shell ornamentation of the pier filling. The boldness of these forms is emphasized even more livelier by the lightening colors of the glass ground. Gates. Above the tabernacle around lies a finely worked marble gate with bronze latticing; carried out in 1366 by the goldsmith Pietro del Migliore; The angel statuettes, who stand on the four columns on their corners, stem from the workshop of Orcagna (167). Floor. From colored marble; by Daniele di Bartolo and Francesco Teri, 1380 (168). The St. Anne Altar In the northeastern (left behind) bay of the interior History. On the St. Anne day of the 1343 the Duke of Athens was driven out of Florence. In memory of this event, the city government made St. Anne the patron of the city and errected an altar in Orsanmichele (169). This construction was done in all haste made of wood and was already in use in January 1344 (170). On the altar, a wood statue of St. Anne Selbdritt. In 1349 the government considered a church for the St. Anne cult across from Orsanmichele (171). When it was completed a few decades later, they left the St. Anne altar in its old place and dedicated the new church to St. Michael. Above the old altar a new St. Anne statue was placed in 1526. In 1575 the heads of the brotherhood of Orsanmichele asked the grand duke Francesco I, if he would grant them the means to replace the 14th century wood altar with a marble one (172). The altar that was built as a result of this request is dated to 1586. In 1770 it was covered over with a Baroque decoration and in 1909 brought back to its original condition (173).

Although no single construction is attested to Taddeo through documents as of yet, this painter, Giotto’s favorite student, in my opinion comes into question for the design of Or S. Michele, because the building concept is very close to Giotto’s cathedral Campanile. (23) As a first step, Gelli attributed – around the mid-sixteenth century – Orsanmichele to Orcagna (see Steinweg, Orcagna, 1929, 10, 44). Del Migliore takes parts of the building for Orcagna’s work (1684, 531; Seinweg, 44). The opinion of Vasari: Arnolfo built the first hall of Orsanmichele, but Taddeo Gaddi the second, Richa looks to reconcile with Del Migliore’s opinion, in which he wrote, Arnolfo, Taddeo and Orcagna worked on Orsanmichele one after another. Gaye looked for a confirmation of acceptance, Orcagna had a share in the construction of Orsanmichele, in which he proved, that the master was named as „Capomaestro“ of the „Oratoriums“ of Orsanmichele between February 13, 1355 and March 29, 1357 (I, 1839, 52), whereby the fact also holds true, that Orcagna named himself as „Oratorii archimagister“ in the 1359 inscription on the Tabernacle of Orsanmichele. Nevertheless, other writers of the 19th century say, only a part of the structure could be attributed to the master, and in particular the padding of the great arcades: Fantozzi, Guida, 1842, 309; Perkins, Tuscan Sculptors, I, 1864, 79; also similar Burkhardt, Cicerone, 1855, 576; Kugler, Gesch. D. Baukunst, III, 1869, 353; Schnaase, Geschichte der Bildenden Künste im Mittelalter, v, 1876, 183. But Passerini authenticated, that these traceries originated with Simone di Francesco Talenti (Steinweg, Orcagna, 1929, 45). Frey concluded that, Orcanga had nothing to do with the structure himself in his capacity as Capomaestro, but rather only with its decoration, such as the likewise the mentioned stone mason Giovanni di Fetto at the Cathedral (Loggia dei Lanzi, 1885, 104). I add on still: perhaps not the church, but rather the tabernacle of the image of mercy was intended with “Oratorium”? The hall itself was indeed in Orcanga’s time not yet an Oratorium, but rather a grain market. At any rate, Klara had Steinweg correct, when she rejected on grounds of stylistic critique, an involvement of Orcagna at the structure (ibid. 45). For this rejection, Tosi, Boll. d’A. XXVII, 1934, 514 ff. has since produced a concise argument (24) Neri di Fioravanti and Francesco Talenti were considered first by Franceschini (Or S. Michele, 1892, 25). Neri di Fioranvanti had connections to the Bauhütte of Orsanmichele twelve years after the start of construction; that is proved documentarily; In 1349/51 he managed the new construction of S. Michele Vecchio with Benci di Cione (S. Carlo Borromeo I; see Band II, 418, Note 5), and this new construction was subordinate to the heads of the Laudesi-Brotherhood of Orsanmichele, indeed this new construction was most likely taken care of by the same builder’s guild; Benci managed also around 1366 the construction of the upper parts of Orsanmichele (see below). Neri also, and Benci certainly later, probably belonged to the Bauhütte of Orsanmichele. Still the components that the two masters carried out in the great room of the Bargello-Palace in 1340-46 (Paatz, Mitt. Inst. Florenz, III, 1931, 311-14) differ considerably from the motifs of Orsanmichele; the coarse forms of the pilasters and the windows in the room have nothing at all in common with them [the motifs from Orsanmichele], and the arch construction technique also made use of the rounded arch (for the diagonal ribbing) and the pointed arch (for the vaulting). In this situation of things, I would like to consider the possibility, that Neri and Benchi worked for Orsanmichele (like for example demonstrably for the cathedral and its Campanile) also at most as stonemasons or at best as foremen, but not as progenitors of the project. A certain choice however will first be allowed to be made, when the building style of both masters, which became for now still not individually tangible, becomes better understood. – About a relationship, that links Orsanmichele with a part of the Bargello-Palace established by Tone di Giovanni’s, see below Note 71 (end). Francesco Talenti is not mentioned in the documents in connection with Orsanmichele; yet he comes into consideration as creator of the architectural concept of Orsanmichele. Because he made the columns and spatial conditions of the nave of S. Maria del Fiore (see Band III, S. 330/31 and S. 445 f. Notes 66 and 67), and he assumed the corresponding motives of Orsanmichele; this conviction has been broadly popular since Franceschini. Siebenhüner actually ventured to attribute Orsanmichele to Francesco Talenti (Thieme-Becker XXXII, 1938, 415). Whether this opinion answers the question definitively must be awaited. Against [this], it could be argued, that when comparing between Orsanmichele and the cathedral nave, outside of the similarities, significant differences exist: in the cathedral itself, instead of the rounded arch, that is predominant in Orsanmichele, one finds again the pointed arch; also the proportions of the cathedral columns are less balanced; the cathedral comes across less harmonically and therefore more dynamically, more austerely, and more sparsely. These differences can be explained by the different eras in which the two structures were built; Talenti’s cathedral nave first developed in 1357 and following, therefore a full twenty years after the start date of Orsanmichele; one could also try to make it comprehensible through the evidence, that Talenti verifiably at times during the cathedral construction had taken into account the wishes of other artists and critics (see Band III, page 449, Note 67, conclusion). The question, whether the aforementioned difference seriously carries weight against the attribution of Orsanmichele to Talenti or not, can be only reliably answered if the research should succeed in more clearly defining Talenti’s character and the outlines of his art. Jacopo Talenti whom Franceschini also considers (Or S. Michele 1892, 25), in my opinion, is eliminated, because his architectural concepts (see under S. Maria Novella) have common general tendencies with Orsanmichele, but also no more. Andrea Pisano comes into consideration just a little: his part at the Campanile of S. Maria del Fiore has nothing at all to do with Orsanmichele stylistically. (25) Document in Gaye I, 1839, 46 f. (26) Document in Gaye I, 1839, 46 f.

(30) Document in Gaye I, 1839, 52. – That on that occasion a conclusion was reached, emerges clearly from a document from November 14, 1358: at that time, the confraternity of Orsanmichele turned their income to other aims, because their own building was finished (Guasti, S. Maria del Fiore, 1887, 132 f.); It will presumably involve the church, not the mercy-image tabernacle, because this was still in progress in 1359/60 (See under Facilities).

O. 36) begründete diese Ansetzung mit dem Stil der Reliefs, die in diesen Backsteinwänden enthalten sind; diese Reliefs wurden jedoch schon vorher für eine andere Verwendung geschaffen (vgl. unter Ausstattung, S. 491). Da eines von ihnen gelegentlich der Einmauerung zur Vervollständigung des Zyklus nachträglich zugefügt wurde und als ein Jugendwerk des Nanni di Banco gilt, könnte man sich versucht fühlen, die Schließung der Arkaden erst um 1400 anzusetzen. Doch scheint mir die Einsetzung von Fenstern, die 1380 erfolgte (vgl. oben), die Schließung der Arkaden bereits vorauszusetzen. (38) Franceschini (ibid. 36) justified this approach with the style of the reliefs, that are included in this brick wall; these Reliefs were created in the first place for another use (See under Ausstattung, pg. 491). Because one of them was subsequently attributed to the masonry work for the completion of the series and applies as an early work of Nanni di Banco, one could feel himself tempted to position the closing of the arcade first around 1400. It seems to me the installation of windows, that took place in 1380 (see oben) already assumed the closure of the arcade. (39) See Foll.-Rastr. VI, 1795, 170 f.; See also Note 50.

(62) It can be discussed only hintingly in this book. — Description. In each floor lancet windows (Biforien) open as the most important partition arrangement. The upper closing of the upper floor and thereby of the whole building forms a considerably protruding cornice, that is built from small calm arches of corbels. The described building elements have a most excellent place in the history of Florentine palace construction. Through the striking size of their windows, through the release of rustication of the exterior walls and through the subtlety of their profile, they take an advance above the Palazzo Vecchio and xxx the xx, that Brunelleschi xx I the upper floor of the Palace of the Guelf Party. – The Type of the tower-like city granary appears in France; the could be sole known medieval example in Pierrelatte (Drôme) in the absence of distinct style, unfortunately cannot be exactly dated; the example in Ardes (Pas de Calais) seemingly originates from the 16th or 17th century. See C. Enlart, Manuel d’archéologie française, II, 1904, 198. (63) A precursor, which largely compares to Orsanmichele, is the Arnolfian Bath. (63a) Such grain chute distribution appliances also appear in French storage facilities, which are not dated clearly, but likely after Orsanmichele was established: C. Enlart, Mauel d’archéologie française, II, 1904, 198. (64) See M. Reymond, La sculpture Florentine I 1897, 203/04 and Venturi, Storia IV, 1906, 706 f. A few of the statues are now replaced by copies; the originals are located in the Bargello, a few maybe also in the great cloister of S. Marco (Sinibaldi, Il museuo di S. Marco, 1936, 38). – Construction documentations (very summarized!) by Mazzanti-Del Lungo, Raccolta, 1876, LXXXVI, LXXXVII and by Rohault de Fleury, 1, 1870. – In my opinion, the motifs stem from the magnificent tracery-motifs, that the father of Simone Talenti, Francesco, established in the upper floor of the Campanile of S. Maria del Fiore. – About the account of the installation of the tracery, see the Building History. After its installation, the tracery must have seemed very similar to that in the Camposanto in Pisa (likewise subsequently configured). (65) The peculiar cross and crenellated patterns of these barriers originate from the decorative forms of the cathedral façade. They could appear on the base step of the main door and on the base step of the northern corner posts (from the sketch from 1486: Figure 99 by Paatz, Werden und Wesen der Tecentoarchitektur, 1937) and could have been created by Arnolfo di Cambio , but also by Francesco Talenti, who verifiably had taken part in the main door (see Band III, pg. 443, note 65). Simone Talenti probably adopted this motif from the decorative forms of his father. (66) About the purpose of this filling wall, see the Building History. (67) About this Wimperg-Type see Reymond, Riv. d’A. I, 1904, 245ff. – For the doors also see note 45. (68) See “Exterior.” – The building type of the column hall has been adopted clearly from the two older, previously existing, on this site granaries (See under Reconstruction). According to Patzak, they were brought together with granaries in French cloisters. (Die Renaissance- und Barockvilla in Italien, I, 1912, 88.) Nevertheless, C. Enlart, who describes such systems, names nothing of the sort (Manuel d’archéologie française, II, 1904, 197/98). Perhaps it has given a few more preliminary stages in Byzantium. Hence, I would like to conclude, that it is preserved in the Constantinople secular buildings of a related type from the time of Emperor Justinian; there are storage halls, whose vaults rest on columns (Cistern of Philoxenos from 519; Cistern of Jere-batan-Serai Bodrum, also called „Basilika,” from 520), or on piers (Cistern of Eschwefije-Sokagh; post-Justinian); see. O. Wulff, Altchristliche und byzantinische Kunst, 1914, 404 (with Note); there is yet another Italian early-Renaissance structure, that corresponds to this Byzantine type, the Santa Maria in Portico a Fontegiusta in Siena. Perhaps in Byzantium, in the city with the richest medieval secular architecture, there are also market halls of according appearance, and perhaps the two older Orsanmichele halls were inspired from such models. (69) The fulfillment of this effort was supported through the fact, that here a planned (market)hall was to be built. The building master had a favorable site, but with more sure mastery. That informs the subsequently described design of the individual forms. (70) Width : Length = 2 : 3 (71) As early as Del Migliore, 1684, 532. – The gothic arch had dominated the Florentine ecclesiastical monumental architecture since the beginning of the new construction of S. Maria Novella (around 1246) until Arnolfo and Giotto. - The Round Arch. On monumental secular structures this older arch form survived occasionally during this era. For example in the Loggia in the court of the Bargello Palace (around 1280/85: see Paatz, Mitt. Inst. Florenz III, 1931, 302ff.) and in the windows of the Palazzo Vecchio (ibid. Figures. Page 313) – both instances presumably in the Arnolfian framework. In church architecture, the round arch was tolerated only outside the circle of the monumental building; on side structures like the portico of S. Jacopo in Campo Corbolini (see Band II, pg. 402 and pg. 408 note 22) and the Chiostro delle Oblate at S. Maria Nuova (1289ff. see Band IV, pg. 12) or on small churches like S. Giovannino dei Cavalieri (1329-36; see Band II. pg. 307; this church for example belongs in the typical style of Arnolfo di Cambio). Orsanmichele (1337ff), the first monumental church, on which the rounded arch appeared again, was conceived as a secular building. Round-arched vault construction The connection of half-circle formed transverse arches and segmented diagonal ribs that you can see on Orsanmichele has been verified on Florentine gothic building since this connection was applied around 1280/85 in the recessed court balcony of the Bargello palace (Mitt. Inst. Florenz, III, 1931, 302 ff.: with note). The forms in Orsanmichele are especially similar to the upper court balconies of the same palace built by Tonne di Giovanni 1320ff. because in them there are not only the same arch forms that are combined but also the diagonal edges of the abutting semi-circular arch, exactly like the outer arcade of Orsanmichele (see Building History, Exterior); and also above the Loggia of Tone di Giovanni see Mitt. Inst. Florenz III, 1931, 308-09 and the notes on pages 305, 310. (72) Nardini found the evolutionary meaning of the post form, indeed without specifying (Il Duomo di S. Giovanni, 1902, 173). Clearly the characteristic connection of gothic logic and Italian simplicity is clearly recognizable. (73) The Gothic arch panels probably come from the Arnolfian decorative wall elements on the outer flanks of S. Maria del Fiore (see Band III, pg. 348, 350). The hexagon that is on the peak is obviously from Giotto’s façade on the Campanile of S. Maria del Fiore. Paatz, Röm, Jb. V, 1941, 204.

Wahrscheinlich ist er eine volkstümliche Abwandlung des Namens der vorher dort befindlichen Kirche ,,S. Michaelis in Orto”, der besagt, daß diese Kirche in Gärten lag; dieser Name ist 1239 urkundlich bezeugt (1). - Eine andere Deutung sieht in dem Beiwort “Or” eine Anspielung auf den Getreidespeicher (lateinisch horreum), der die ältere Kirche ersetzte (2), doch wird diese Annahme durch das Vorkommen des Wortes “Orto” im Jahre 1239, also vor der Gründung des Kornspeichers, wiederlegt. Baugeschichte An der Stelle von Or San Michele befand sich ursprünglich ein kleines Nonnenkloster mit einer Kirche namens S. Michaelis in Orto; es wurde 895 als eine bereits seit langem bestehende Stiftung des Abtes Peter von S. Silvestro in Nonantola bezeichnet (3) und ist vielleicht bald nach der Gründung des Mutterklosters (752) eingerichtet worden, da es noch dem Kult des langobardischen Nationalheiligen ge­weiht wurde (4). Das Kloster blieb im Besitz der berühmten ober­italienischen Abtei, so lange es bestand (5). Es scheint im Florentiner Kulturleben als eine der ersten Pflegstätten der Webekunst schon während des 9. Jahrhunderts eine gewisse Bedeutung gehabt zu haben (6). 1046 stand S. Michele in Orto unter der Verwaltung eines Propstes (7); das Nonnenkloster existierte also möglicherweise nicht mehr. Im Jahre 1239 wurde die Kirche anscheinend in einer Ge­schlechterfehde zerstört, und zwar durch Schuld des Munaldus Ranutius und anderer Florentiner Bürger (8). Des neugewonnenen Raumes im Zentrum der Stadt bemächtigte sich die Stadtverwaltung, um einen öffentlichen Platz herzurichten (9). Einige Jahrzehnte später, im Februar 1285, ließ sie eben dort eine offene Halle für den Kornmarkt aufführen (10). Dieser Bau soll von Arnolfo di Cambio errichtet worden sein (11) und war 1290 bereits in Gebrauch (12). An einem seiner Pfeiler war ein Madonnenbild angebracht worden. Dieses begann im Jahre 1292 auf wunderbare Weise Kranke zu heilen; seitdem wurde die Halle eine der wichtigsten Kultstätten der Stadt und der Sitz einer mächtigen Bruderschaft, die regelmäßig Lobgesänge zu Ehren des Gnadenbildes ver­anstaltete und deshalb ,,Laudesi” genannt wurde (13). Immerhin diente die Halle noch einige weitere Jahrzehnte hindurch auch ihrem ursprünglichen profanen Zweck.Im Jahre 1304 fiel sie mit ihrem ganzen Stadtviertel dem Brande zum Opfer, den Ser Neri Abati im Verlauf eines Geschlechterkampfes angelegt hatte (14). 1307 begann man mit der Errichtung des Ersatzbaus (15). Diese zweite, 1308 noch unvollendete Halle scheint nicht sehr solide ge­raten zu sein (16). Schon 1321 drohte sie zusammenzustürzen und mußte repariert werden (17). Dasselbe wiederholte sich dann noch einmal im Jahre 1332 (18). Möglicherweise hat die Überschwem­mung von 1333, während der das Wasser in der Halle zwei Ellen hoch stand (19), den Verfall des Gebäudes von neuem beschleunigt. Jedenfalls stellte die Regierung 1336 in aller Form fest, daß die Halle wegen ihrer geringen Größe die Menge des aufgespeicherten Ge­treides nicht genügend schützen könne und außerdem geradezu einen Schandfleck im Stadtbild darstelle; es solle, so beschloß sie, an ihrer Stelle eine neue Halle entstehen, und zwar ein richtiger Palast, groß genug, um das Korn besser aufzubewahren und dem Kult des wunder­tätigen Madonnenbildes einen würdigen Rahmen zu bieten, schön genug, um dem Staat Ehre zu machen; zugleich wurde eine Kom­mission eingesetzt, um den Neubau in Gang zu bringen (20). Am 29. Juli des folgenden Jahres erfolgte die feierliche Grundsteinlegung in Gegenwart aller Behörden; zugleich wurde festgesetzt, daß über dem neu zu bauenden Gnadenbild-,,Oratorium” zwei gewölbte Ge­schosse als Kornspeicher zu errichten wären, und zwei Jahre später, daß die Zünfte (als Mitträger der Stadtregierung) an dem neuen Palast ihre Schutzpatrone aufzustellen hätten, derart, daß jeder Pfeiler der Halle mit einem Heiligen geschmückt würde (21). Das großartige Wahrzeichen des florentinischen Gemeinwesens, das dann in jahrzehntelanger Arbeit hier erwuchs und von jeher als eines der vollkommensten Denkmäler fiorentinischer Gotik und Renaissance bewundert wird, ist also schon damals mit vollem Bewußtsein und in seinem ganzen Umfang geplant worden. Wer den Entwurf für den Neubau geliefert und damit eine neue Epoche in der Entwicklung der Florentiner Gotik eingeleitet hat, ist ungewiß. Der Maler Taddeo Gaddi, dem Vasari dieses Verdienst zu­ schreibt, kommt in Betracht (22), Andrea Orcagna nicht (23). Außer­dem kommen dafür in Frage Neri di Fioravanti, Benci di Cione und vor allem Francesco Talenti, deren spätere Bauten und Schulbauten, der Dom und die Loggia de’Lanzi, eine folgerichtige Entfaltung des Stils von Or San Michele brachten (24). Bauherrin war als Vertreterin der Stadtregierung die Zunft der Seidenweber (25). Der Bau muß in den ersten Jahren ziemlich schnell gefördert worden sein. Anfang 1339 standen schon Teile von mehreren der zehn Pfeiler, und der Rest sollte unmittelbar folgen (26). - Im Herbst desselben Jahres und im Jahre 1342 stellte die Regierung weitere Mittel für den Bau bereit (27). 1343 stiftete sie einen St. Annenkult in Or San Michele, um den Tag der Vertreibung des Herzogs von Athen in feierlicher Erinnerung zu halten. Damals entschloß man sich anscheinend, dem begonnenen Markthallengeschoß des Neuhaus in höherem Grade den Charakter einer Kirche zu geben (28). Bald danach scheinen die Arbeiten allmählich langsamer geworden und schließlich durch die Pest von 1348 gänzlich ins Stocken geraten zu sein. “Die Pfeiler stehen fertig, mit ihren Fresken geschmückt, die Lehrgerüste für die Gewölbe sind errichtet, und wenn nicht bald Mittel zur Weiterführung des Baues bewilligt werden, so muß das alles verderben”, berichtet die Seidenzunft am 19. April 1350 anschaulich und Hilfe flehend an die Stadtverwaltung (29). Wirklich muß sie dadurch das Unternehmen wieder in Gang gebracht haben. Wenig später erfolgt die Bestellung eines kostbaren Tabernakels für das wundertätige Madonnenbild; das läßt vermuten, daß man sicher auf eine baldige Vollendung der Kirche rechnete, und im April des Jahres 1357 scheinen deren Gewölbe bereits fertig gewesen zu sein (30). Um dieselbe Zeit (1361) verlegte die Regierung den Getreidemarkt von der Piazza di Or San Michele weg, um dem nahezu fertigen Tabernakel eine würdige Umgebung zu sichern (31). Damit war ein weiterer, entscheidener Schritt in der allmählichen Eroberung des Gebäudes durch den Kult getan. Die vollständige Verwischung aller Spuren der ursprünglichen, pro­fanen Zweckbestimmung wurde 1366 beschlossen, während die Errichtung der oberen, auch weiterhin zur Kornspeicherung bestimmten Räume unter Leitung von Benci di Cione langsam voranschritt (32). Damals wurden sich die Vorsteher einig, die Arkaden des Erdgeschosses durch Maßwerk zu vergittern und die offene Halle da­durch in eine geschlossene Kirche zu verwandeln (33). Im selben Jahre wurde die Besorgung des Altardienstes den Mönchsorden ge­nommen, die sie in einem bestimmten Turnus erledigt hatten, und einem eigens dafür angestellten Sakristan übertragen (34). Am 2. April 1367 (nach anderen am 11. April 1366) waren zwei Bogen­füllungen bereits begonnen, und man bedeutete dem Simone di Francesco Talenti, er solle diese von ihm geschaffenen Probestücke vollenden, dann aber weitere Weisungen der Baubehörde abwarten (35). Von einer Fortführung der Arbeit ist erst wieder 1378 und 1380 die Rede. Als leitender Baumeister erscheint von neuem Simone di Francesco Talenti; als ausführende, anscheinend recht ungeschickte Kräfte werden die Steinmetzen Antonio di Francesco, Giovanni di Buonafede, Leonardo Masi, Matteo di Cione, Lorenzo di Filippo ge­nannt, die man verschiedentlich zwang, für verpfuschte Arbeit Er­satz zu leisten (36). 1380 dürfte die Einfügung des Maßwerks in die Arkaden zum Abschluß gekommen sein, denn in diesem Jahre ist von der Versetzung von Fenstern die Rede (37). - Damals hatte man sich also wohl auch bereits entschlossen, das Stabwerk in den Arkaden mit Mauern zu verschließen (38). Doch blieben die mittleren Öffnungen in den mittleren Arkaden der beiden Langseiten offen und erhielten sich in diesem Zustand bis zum Jahre 1770 (39). 1380 scheint sich auch der Bau der oberen Stockwerke des Palastes dem Abschluß genähert zu hahen. Damals wurde Marmor besorgt, wohl für die Prunkfenster (40), und am Dach gearbeitet (41). Die Beschleunigung der Arbeiten kurz vor 1380 mag damit zusammen­hängen, daß 1376 die Laudesi-Bruderschaft die Bauleitung an Stelle der Seidenzunft übertragen bekam (42). Um 1380 stand die Kirche also im wesentlichen so da, wie sie heute erhalten ist Doch blieb noch einige Kleinarbeit zu leisten. 1384 wurde ein Zehntel der Einkünfte der Bruderschaft für die Weiterführung des Baus bestimmt; 1397 neue Zahlungen (43). 1404 wurde das Kranz-Gesims des Palastes aufgesetzt (44). 1408 und 1410 führte Niccolò di Piero Lamberti die vielleicht schon früher begonnen Arbeiten an den beiden Hauptportalen zu Ende; sein Anteil ist heute nicht mehr sicher abzugrenzen (45). 1415 richtete man ein Kollegiatstift in der Kirche ein (46). Um 1480 wurde sie vorübergehend profaniert (47). Sie erlitt aßer niemals ernstliche Veränderungen. 1569 wurde das Obergeschoß des Palastes als Staatsarchiv eingerichtet (48) und mit dem gegenüberliegenden Amtsgebäude der Wollweberzunft über die Straße hinweg durch eine Überführung verbunden, und zwar angeblich durch Bernardo Buontalenti. 1628 vermauerte man das rechte, südliche Hauptportal der Fassade (49). 1770 wurden die bis dahin im unteren Teil offen­gebliebenen mittleren Öffnungen in den mittleren Arkaden der Flanken vermauert; gleichzeitig baute man im linken, nördlichen Chorjoch eine Sakristei ein (50). 1821 wurde das Bogenfeld unter dem Verbindungsbogen des Buontalenti entfernt, 1858 wieder er­neuert (51). 1852 ff. wurden die dekorativen Teile der Arkaden zum großen Teil ausgewechselt (52). 1901 fand eine neue Restaurierung statt (53). 1931 ff. wurde der Fußboden in den beiden vorderen Jochen des Oratoriums, der nachträglich auf das etwas höhere Niveau des letzten (Chor-)Joches gebracht worden war, wieder in den ursprüng­lichen Zustand versetzt und der Sakristei-Einbau entfernt. Rekonstruktion der Verlorener Bauzustände Kirche und Kloster S. Michaelis in Orto. Über den karolingischen Klosterbau des 8. oder 9. Jahrhunderts ist nur bekannt, daß er eine Werkstatt für Wollweberei enthielt (54). Die Kirche wird ganz klein gewesen sein, da der Konvent nur aus wenigen Nonnen bestand (885 waren es 6 Schwestern). Die erste Kornhalle; 1285, von Arnolfo di Cambio (?). Zierlicher Hausteinbau mit zehn Pfeilern (55). - Der Pfeiler mit dem berühmten Gnadenhild (vgl. unten S. 499) war schon 1294 mit einem hölzernen Hüttchen umbaut, das die Andächtigen gegen die Ahendluft schützen sollte (56). Ob von diesem Pfeiler noch ein Überrest vorhanden ist (im jetzigen Gnadenbild-Tabernakel), wäre zu klären; vgl. dazu S. 499 f. Die zweite Kornhalle; 1308 ff. Sie war wesentlich kleiner als der heutige Bau (57) und hatte dünne, schlecht fundamentierte Backsteinpfeiler (58). An einem der Pfeiler das Gnadenbild; ob sich ein Überrest dieses Pfeilers erhalten hat (im jetzigen Gnadenbild-Tabernakel), wäre noch zu klären; vgl. dazu S. 499 f. Baubeschreibung Allgemeines.

Der Baugedanke von Or San Michele ist ein Unikum: in ihm verbinden sich die architektonischen Typen der Markthalle, des Speicherhauses und des Bruderschafts-Oratoriums zu einer Einheit, die nur durch das Zusammentreffen ganz besonderer geschichtlicher Umstände zustande kommen konnte (60). Das Erdgeschoß — als Markthalle begonnen — ist eine gewölbte Pfeilerhalle; es war ursprünglich offen und wurde erst nach einem Planwechsel durch Vermauerung der äußeren Arkaden in einen geschlossenen Kirchenraum verwandelt (61). Darüber erheben sich zwei hohe, als Kornspeicher errichtete Obergeschosse (62). Der ursprünglich beabsichtigte Gegensatz zwischen der offenen Pfeilerhalle und dem darüber aufstrebenden turmhausartigen Block der Speichergeschosse muß sehr eigenartig gewirkt haben.

(22) Vasari I, 576. Vgl. auch Kugler, Gesch. D. Baukunst, III, 1859, 553. Obwohl für Taddeo bisher kein einziges Bauwerk urkundlich bezeugt ist, kommt dieser Maler, Giottos Lieblingschüler, m. E. für den Entwurf von Or S. Michele in Betracht, weil der Baugedanke dem Dom-Campanile Giottos ganz nahe steht. (23) Als erster schreib Gelli – um die Mitte des 16. Jahrhunderts – Or San Michele dem Orcagna zu (vgl. Steinweg, Orcagna, 1929, 10, 44). Teile des Baues hielt auch Del Migliore für Orcagnas Werk (1684, 531; Seinweg, 44). Die Meinung Vasaris, Arnolfo habe die erste Halle von Or San Michele gebaut, Taddeo Gaddi aber die zweite, suchte Richa mit Del Migliores Meinung zu versöhnen, indem er schrieb, Arnolfo, Taddeo und Orcagna hätten nacheinander an Or San Michele gearbeitet. Gaye versuchte eine Bestätigung der Annahme, Orcagna habe einen Anteil am Bau von Or San Michele genannt wird (I, 1839, 52), wozu auch die Tatsache stimmt, daß Orcagna sich selbst in der 1359 datierten Inschrift am Tabernakel von Or San Michele „Oratorii archimagister“ nannte. Doch meinten andere Schriftsteller des 19. Jahrhunderts, dem Meister könne nur ein Teil des Bauwerkes zugeschrieben werden, und zwar vor allem das Füllwerk der großen Arkaden: Fantozzi, Guida, 1842, 309; Perkins, Tuscan Sculptors, I, 1863, 79; ähnlich auch Burckhardt, Cicerone, 1855, 576; Kugler, Gesch. d. Baukunst, III, 1859, 353; Schnaase, Geschichte der Bildenden Künste im Mittelalter, V, 1876, 183. Doch wies Passerini dann urkundlich nach, daß diese Füllungen von Simone di Francesco Talenti stammten (Seinweg, Orcagna, 1929, 45). Frey folgerte daraus, Orcagna habe in seiner Eigenschaft als Capomaestro nichts mit dem Bau selbst zu tun gehabt, sondern nur mit dessen Dekoration, wie etwa der gleichfalls Capomaestro gennante Steinmetz Giovanni di Fetto am Dom (Loggia Die Lanzi, 1885, 104). Ich füge noch hinzu: vielleicht war mit „Oratorium“ nicht die Kirche, sondern nur das Tabernakel des Gnadenbildes gemeint? Die Halle selbst war ja zu Orcagnas Zeiten noch nicht Oratorium, sondern Getreidenmarkt. Jedenfallas hat Klara Steinweg recht, wenn sie aus stilkritischen Gründen eine Beteiligung Orcagnas am Bau ablehnt (a. a. O. 45). Für diese Ablehnung hat Tosi, Boll. d’A. XXVII, 1934, 514 ff. inzwischen einen bündigen Beweis erbracht. (24) Neri di Fioravanti und Francesco Talenti wurden zuerst von Franceschini in Betracht gezogen (Or S. Michele, 1892, 25). Neri di Fioravanti hatte zwölf Jahre nach dem Baubeginn Beziehungen zur Bauhütte von Or San Michele; das läßt sich urkundlich belegen: 1349/51 leitete er zusammen mit Benci di Cione den Neubau von S. Michele Vecchio (S. Carlo Borromeo I; vgl. Band II, 418, Anm. 5), und dieser Neubau unterstand den Vorstehern der Laudesi-Bruderschaft von Or San Michele, ja er wurde höchstwahrscheinlich von deren eigener Bauhütte nebenher mit besorgt; Benci leitete außerdem um 1366 die Errichtung der oberen Teile von Or San Michele (vgl. unten). Neri hat also wahrscheinlich und Benci sicher später der Bauhütte von Or San Michele angehört. Doch unterscheiden sich die Bauteile, die die beiden Meister 1340-46 im Großen Saal des Bargello­Palastes ausführten (Paatz, Mitt. Inst. Florenz, III, 1931, 311-14), ziemlich von den Motiven von Or San Michele; die derben Formen der Wandpfeiler und des Fensters im Saal haben gar nichts mit ihnen gemeinsam, und die Gewölbekonstruktion verwendet im Saal zwar auch den Rundbogen (für die Diagonalrippen), aber daneben noch den Spitzbogen (für die Schildbögen). Bei dieser Lage der Dinge möchte ich die Möglichkeit in Betracht ziehen, daß Neri und Benci für Or San Michele {wie z. B. auch nachweislich für den Dom und seinen Campanile) allenfalls als Steinmetzen oder höchstens als Bauführer gearbeitet haben, nicht aber als Schöpfer des Entwurfs. Eine sichere Entscheidung wird sich freilich erst treffen lassen, wenn der Baustil der beiden Meister, der z. Z. noch nicht individuell faßbar geworden ist, besser bekannt sein wird. - Über eine Beziehung, die Or San Michele mit einem von Tone di Giovanni errichteten Teil des Bargello-Palastes verbindet, vgl. unten Anm. 71 (Schluß). Francesco Talenti wird zwar von den Urkunden nicht im Zusammenhang mit Or San Michele erwähnt; dennoch kommt er als Schöpfer des Baugedankens von Or San Michele mit in Betracht. Denn er schuf die Pfeiler und Raumverhältnisse des Langhauses von S. Maria del Fiore (vgl. Band III, S. 330/31 und S. 445 f. Anm. 66 und 67), und er ging dabei von den entsprechenden Motiven von Or San Michele aus; diese Überzeugung ist seit Franceschini allgemein verbreitet. Siebenhüner hat es deshalb sogar gewagt, Or San Michele dem Francesco Talenti zuzuschreiben (Thieme-Becker XXXII, 1938, 415). Ob diese Meinung die Frage endgültig beantwortet, muß abgewartet werden. Gegen sie ließe sich anführen, daß sich bei einem Vergleich zwischen Or San Michele und dem Dom-Langhaus außer den Übereinstimmungen auch wesentliche Unterschiede ergeben: im Dom findet sich statt des Rundbogens, der in Or San Michele vorherrscht, wieder der Spitzbogen; auch sind die Proportionen der Dom-Pfeiler weniger ausgeglichen; der Dom wirkt überhaupt in jeder Beziehung weniger harmonisch und dafür dynamischer, herber und karger. Man mag diese Unterschiede aus dem zeitlichen Abstand zwischen den beiden Bauten erklären; Talentis Dom-Langhaus entstand erst seit 1357 ff., also volle zwanzig Jahre nach dem Baubeginn von Or San Michele; man könnte auch versuchen, sie durch den Hinweis begreiflich zu machen, daß Talenti beim Dombau zuweilen nachweislich die Wünsche anderer Künstler und Kunstrichter zu berücksichtigen hatte (vgl. Band III, S. 449, Anm. 67, Schluß). Die Frage, ob die besagten Unterschiede ernstlich gegen die Zuschreibung von Or San Michele an Talenti ins Gewicht fallen oder nicht, wird zuverlässig erst beantwortet werden können, wenn es der Forschung gelingen sollte, die Persönlichkeit Talentis und die Umrisse seiner Kunst klarer herauszuarbeiten. Jacopo Talenti, den Franceschini auch in Betracht zieht (Or S. Michele 1892, 25), scheidet meines Erachtens aus, weil seine Baugedanken (vgl. unter S. Maria Novella) mit Or San Michele zwar die Grundrichtung gemeinsam haben, aber auch nicht mehr. Andrea Pisano kommt ebensowenig in Betracht: sein Anteil am Campanile von S. Maria del Fiore hat stilistisch gar nichts mit Or San Michele zu tun. (25) Urkunde bei Gaye I, 1839, 46 f. (26) Urkunde bei Gaye I, 1839, 46/47 f. - Im Jahre 1340 waren bereits zwei Pfeiler mit Tabernakeln und Statuen versehen, und ein dritter sollte gerade denselben Schmuck erhalten (Urkunde bei Frey-Vasari I, 1911, 379).

(30) Urkunde bei Gaye I, 1839, 52. - Daß damal ein Ahschluß erreicht wurde, geht deutlich aus einer Urkunde vom 14. November 1358 hervor: damals wandte die Bruderschaft von Or San Michele ihre Einkünfte anderen Zwecken zu, da ihr eigener Bau vollendet war (Guasti, S. Maria del Fiore, 1887, 132 f.); es wird sich dabei vermutlich um die Kirche handeln, nicht um das Gnadenbild-Tabernakel, denn dieses war 1359/60 noch in Arbeit (vgl. unter Ausstattung).

Da eines von ihnen gelegentlich der Einmauerung zur Vervollständigung des Zyklus nachträglich zugefügt wurde und als ein Jugendwerk des Nanni di Banco gilt, könnte man sich versucht fühlen, die Schließung der Arkaden erst um 1400 anzusetzen. Doch scheint mir die Einsetzung von Fenstern, die 1380 erfolgte (vgl. oben), die Schließung der Arkaden bereits vorauszusetzen. (39) Vgl. Foll.-Rastr. VI, 1795, 170 f.; vgl. auch Anm. 50.

        "content"  : "The Loggia of the Bigallo Among the most praiseworthy decisions made by the rulers of Tuscany in the wake of the dismantling of the Austro-Lorraine dynasty was the one to reopen the loggia of the Bigallo on the square of the Duomo. After a few years of waiting, the desires of the people were realized through the wise direction of the architect Mariano Falcini, whose restoration work can still be seen in the upper sections of the building. I believe it is important to reveal information I have uncovered about this building and its artistic value. This elegant loggia was built by the Captains of the Misericordia for the purpose both of celebrating the charity of the city [which supported the foster home of the Bigallo] and of alerting the public to the fate of those children who, abandoned in the streets, were reunited with the same inhuman parents who came to collect them. I have already addressed the issues of when and how the institution was born, as well as its primitive purpose, in my work on Charitable institutions published in 1853 by Le Monnier; and here I would like to note that recent archival discoveries have confirmed that the Society of the Misericordia was formed after the plague of 1326 by members of the Company of the Laudesi of the Virgin of Orsanmichele, which contradicts the fairy tales invented by the priest Lorenzo Fici in 1605 and repeated by other writers who have examined this pious place. The rectors of the benevolent association, made rich in 1348 thanks to the legacies it received, maintained a stable place to exercise those works of piety that were appropriate in their institution. To this end, considering the opportunity of building on their site – donated to them by Giovanni d’Albizzo Pellegrini on 16 September 1354 – the rectors considered building a chapel and some rooms in a structure on the Piazza S. Giovanni. However, the site seemed too cramped for such a building and rectors beseeched the Florentines for additional space. On January 21 of the following year (1355) the commune and people of Santa Reparata gave them an additional 10 braccie (about six meters) of territory on the corner of the Corso Adimari, which they used to build their oratory.[1] This is the most accurate date for the building: Vasari incorrectly attributed the design to the hand of Nicola Pisano, who had already been dead for a century when the building was actually constructed. We do not know the name of the architect, but it is not unlikely that Andrea Orcagna had a part in it, because the style of the building closely matches his own: but this can not be determined with certainty, due to the fact that we have lost the books from the Capitani della Misericordia that record transactions between 1352 and 1358. The construction of the loggia was completed in 1358, and in that year they closed the arches with iron gates, made by Francesco Petrucci, a famous Sienese artist known for other works of a similar kind: and these little gates could not have been of poor quality when installed, for their maker was paid the conspicuous sum of 55 gold florins.[2] At the same time Alberto Arnoldi carved for the altar of the chapel the statue of Virgin Mary and the two angels at her side; and this work produced between 1359 and 1364 was produced by a member of the illustrious school of Andrea Pisano who received 280 gold florins. He (Alberto Arnoldi) simultaneously produced the other image of the Madonna, placed on the door beside the oratory there in the piazza di San Giovanni, which he finished in June of 1361 for 16 gold florins. Even this report was misconstrued by Vasari, who judged these sculptures as the work of Andrea Pisano and his chief assistant, Ciognara, which I noted in my abovementioned book.[3] The Captain’s records recount the funding of fresco paintings that decorated the vaults of the chapel in 1363, which were produced by the two painters Nardo and Bartolommeo. The first of these was probably the brother of Andrea Orcagna (Nardo di Cione), and the other was the Sienese painter named Bartolommeo, believed to be the same Bulgarini who performed many works in the city of Florence. In addition to these paintings, Giunta and Rossello later painted works in 1425, and others were executed on the walls by Giovanni di Donnino in 1436.[4] I do not know the subject or even the form of these paintings because they are not described in the aforementioned books, and now they can no longer be seen as they were hidden from view by the plaster that was laid on as a whitewash coat in 1760, ordered by the rector at that time named Angiolo Maria Ricci in an attempt to highlight the baroque ornaments more recently executed by Stefano Fabbrini. Today we protest this barbarism: but our ancestors did not think so, as that was the taste of that century. While they painted the vaults, they hired a painter named Ambrogio, perhaps Lorenzetti or Baldesi: but that is not what is currently seen on the altar, because this work was replaced in 1512 by a remarkable altarpiece painted by Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio and made with beautiful relief carvings by Antonio Carota, a famous artist at that time. Records in the Captain’s account books indicate that Niccolò di Piero Gerini and Ambrose di Baldese, arriving in 1386, painted on the exterior wall of the oratory that beautiful fresco that is now displayed in the room of the Commissioner of the orphanage S. Maria del Bigallo. The fresco, which was transferred there in 1777, represents on one side a group of children being separated from their parents and, on the other, joyful mothers receiving the children they had previously abandoned to the care of the brothers of the Misericordia.[5] It is well known that the benefices and privileges given to the Company by the whole city would not be enough to prevent the ruin of the pious association. Despite by the protection of Cosimo the Elder of the Medici, the poor management of the confraternity threatened its solvency, and in 1425 two confraternities joined to form one, in a way that enhanced the revenues of the Misericordia in ways from which Cosimo could benefit. As a natural consequence, the former duties of the Misericordia were ceased. When, after many years, it was deemed important to revive it to a new life, the memory of Cosimo’s intrigues caused the commune in 1489 to abolish the ability of private citizens to interfere with the interests of the charitable institution. Turning now to the artistic issues that surround this place, we learn that the new masters of the recomposed confratnernity, the Capitani del Bigallo – perhaps to erase the memory of their usurpation of the Misericordia in 1425 – moved to decorate the outer walls of the palace above the oratory with paintings that represented a more favorable account of these facts. They did so when, after a disasterous fire damaged the oratory on July 23, 1442, the captains rebuilt most of the upper half of the building. The paintings have never been correctly interpreted: Lastri, Rosselli, and Landini attributed them to Taddeo Gaddi, but were understandably confused by their style which seem consistent with other pictures of the time. Richa, Rumhor and Becchi mistakenly ascribed them to Piero Chellini, who did indeed work for the Bigallo, but more as a whitewasher than an artist (as I demonstrated in my book on Florentine charity, in which I cited the documents that reveal that Ventura di Moro and Rossello di Iacopo of Scolaio Franchi were the authors of these frescoes in 1445.[6] Here we bring to a close our discussion of this place, not wishing to examine the adjacent building or the works of Filippo di Cristofano, Ambrose di Baldese and Mariotto di Nardo, who painted unusual pictures there: all of this material I have published in my book on the charities of this city on pages 9, 150 and following. Notes [1] In the 1354th year of our Lord’s incarnation, on January 21, Mr. Giovanni, son of Sir Piero the surveyor of the commune, and Mr. Tomaso di Iacopo di Passero, master of the commune, in the presence of Mr. Bartolo, the procurator of the major church of Florence, and other priests and dignitaries, in order to build an oratory on the corner of the Piazza di San Giovanni, give ten braccie of territory (give or take some space) from the primary area of the via degli Adimari, next to the column of the house adjacent to the said building. They declare this and bid the notary Ser Matteo di Gherardo da Panico to write down the agreement (see Florence, Archivio di Stato, Bigallo, Libro II of Delib. e Stanziamenti, fascicolo I, carte 28). [2] In the 1358th year of our Lord’s incarnation, on 9 March, Manetto di Giovanni Davanzati paid 55 gold florins to Francesco Petrucci da Siena for the iron gates of the oratory of the said company – Archivio centrale di Stato, Bigallo, Deliberazioni dei Capitano II, II, carte 7. [3] 1359, indiction 15, 18th day of June: Filippo di Bartolo Filippi, Rusticho Donati, Filippo del Nero, Davanzato Iohanni (Davanzati), Giovanni di Firenze, e Francesco di Pero captions of this confratnerity, in their name and on half of their compatriots, deliberated on the following things: First, they agreed to offer to Alberto Arnoldo, master from the parish of San Michele Berteldi, the commission to produce an image in marble of Our Lady holding her Son in her arms in an act of mercy, decorated and adorned in gold and lustrious colors as is appropriate, with two angels: the Madonna should be at least three braccie tall (roughly 1.5 meters) and the two angels at least two and half braccie tall (roughly 1.25 meters). All of these figures must be by the hand of Alberto, who shall receive a salary of 55 florins for the figure of our Lady and one hundred thirty florins for the two angels, who should be holding candles in their hands: the figure of Mary should be of a higher quality than the figure of Our Lady in Pisa. Its quality will be judged by three or four masters deemed to be qualified by the city of Florence, which shall appoint them at the time. And if it is deemed to be inferior to the one in Pisa, the Bigallo will not be obligated to keep it. And the images of the marble angels must be of the same quality and beauty of the said figure of Mary. He will be paid in the following manner: he will recieve an initial payment of one hundred gold florins, and when the figure of Our Lady has been completed to our satisfaction he will have fifty gold florins, and when he has completed the angels he will receive fifty gold florins; he will compose and install in the oratory the figures at his own expense. And the figures will be completed in two years from the time of their initiation, as indicated by the date of the first payment of one hundred florins. See the statement notarized by Ser Tino (aforementioned book, carte 12). 1364, 16 August. They met and absolved the master Alberto Arnoldi and his son, Alesso, of wrongdoing in the production of the figures of Our Lady and angels, and they declared him to be in accord with the agreement made, and they asked me to check the contract and all the agreements, which I annulled and canceled (see carte 57). 1361, indiction 14, 25 June. They deliberated and decided to send the company’s administator (burser) to pay the debt of 16 gold florins to the master Alberto Arnoldo as final payment for the figure and marble image of Our Lady holding her blessing son at her breast, which was positioned over the portal of the oratory. [4] 1363, 24 June. The captains directed the administrator to pay the painter, Bartolommeo, 62 lire, 4 sold, and 6 denari for pictures at the head of the oratory (see carte 37). 1363, 24 October. The Captains of the Misericordia – Statio Dati, Tellino Dino, Piero Borsi, Duccio di Giovanni, Ruberto Martelli – in the name of the confraternity and the company, discussed a number of things listed below. First they discussed the work in the Oratory where one sees figures, that is on the face of the pedestal made by the master Ambrogio that is designed and made as well as is possible; for the best value, make sure we don’t spend more than 100 gold florins. They also discussed the work that they want done by Nardo the painter for the price of forty florins, in that form that Tino wants; in these things they directed me to make a contract to hire them. [5] 1386, 5 July. The Captains of the Misericordia - Giovanni Federighi, Nuto di Francesco, Giusto di Coverello, Soldo di Lippo Soldani, Francesco di Lutozzo (Nasi), e Iacopo del Riccio, minus the absent Tommaso di Francesco – gave to the painters Niccolò di Piero and Ambrogio di Baldese, on June 22, seventeen gold florins for the completion of work on the paintings on the facade of the front of the Residence of the Misericordia, as appears in this book of entries (see book 3, carte 27 verso). [6] 1446 – Ventura di Moro, painter, received four florins on 27 May, as appears in the fourth book of accounts by Giovanni da Filicaia, our administator, on carte 108. And on the 28th of August fifteen florins were given to Rossello the painter for finishing half of the painting for the company of the history of Saint Peter Martyr on the facade of our company, as written down by our Syndicate, Lorenzo di Bartolommeo the painter (Archivio di Stato, Libro dei debitori e creditori del Bigallo del 1446 e 1447, G, carte 10. The pictures by Chellini must be those made to ornament the elegant windows at the top of the oratory’s loggia, that the master restored from the antique when it was last left in a poor state. Here’s the relative item: 1343, 10 March: The painter Piero Cellini and his followers may receive payment for the favorable execution of pictures; twenty lire for the procurement of lime and materials for scaffolding – Deliberazioni dei Capitani del Bigallo, 1443 e 1444, filza VI, carte 10). And I must add to this preceeding statement, noted not by me but by Rumhor and Becchi – 1444, June 1, Piero Chellini painter for restoring pictures on the facade of the residence of the Captains. Original Text: La Loggetta del Bigallo Fu lodevole pensiero di chi reggeva le sorti della Toscana dopo la partenza della dinastia Austro-Lorenese quello di riaprire la loggetta che dicesi del Bigallo, sulla piazza del Duomo: e dopo alcuni anni di espettativa sono stati coronati i voti comuni, vedendosi finalmente compiuto, in parte, il lavoro sotto la sapiente direzione dell’architetto Mariano Falcini, abbenchè resti ancora farsi il restauro del soprastante edifizio. Collegandosi a questo luogo non poche memorie artistiche, non stimo opera inutile lo esporre tutto quello che mi è stato concesso di ritrovare relativo a tale monumento. Questa elegante loggetta fu edificata dai Capitani di S. Maria della Misericordia all’oggetto di esporvi alla pubblica pietà quei fanciulli che, abbandonati per le vie, da essi si raccoglievano per tentare se modo vi fosse di riconoscere gl’inumani genitori, ed anche per sollecitare la carità cittadina a loro vantaggio. Quando e come nascesse la pia istituzione, qual fosse il primitive suo scopo, esposi in un mio lavoro sugli’istituti di beneficenza edito nel 1853 coi tipi del Le Monnier: e qui mi piace di ripetere, poichè ne ho avuta conferma dai documenti posteriormente trovati, che non m’ingannai, asserendo la Compagnia della Misericordia nata dai Laudesi della Vergine di Orsanmichele in occasione della peste del 1326, e che sono favole i racconti immaginati dal prete Lorenzo Fici nel 1605 e ripetuti da quanti scrissero sulla origine del luogo pio. I rettori del benefico sodalizio, fatti ricchi pei lasciti conseguiti nel 1348, pensarono ad avere un luogo stabile di residenza per esercitare quelle opere di pietà ch’erano proprie del loro istituto. Al quale oggetto, pensando alla opportunità del locale, deliberarono di costruire una cappella ed alcune stanza sulla piazza di S. Giovanni, valendosi della casa che aveva ad essi donata Giovanni d’Albizzo Pellegrini, il 16 settembre 1354, nell’atto di costituirsi loro servo per tutta la vita. Ma parendo ad essi troppo angusto quel luogo, sollecitarono la pietà dei Fiorentini; nè vi ricorsero invano, avvengnachè ottennero dai poplani di S. Reparata altre dieci braccia di terreno sul canto del Corso degli Adimari, il 21 gennaio dell’anno appresso, affinchè vi potessero costruire il loro oratorio.[1] Questa è la data più precisa dell’edifizio: laondo mal si appone il Vasari, ascrivendolo tra le opere di Niccolò Pisano già morto da un secolo. Ignorasi chi ne fu l’architetto, ma non è improbabile che vi avesse parte Andrea Orcagna, perchè lo stile dell’edifizio molto si acosta a quello ch’era proprio di lui: nè mai potrà determinarsi con sicurezza, mancando tra i libri dei Capitani della Misericordia tutti quelli che vanno dai primi mesi del 1352 al 1358. La costruzione della loggia era compiuta nel 1358, ed in quell’anno se ne chiudevano le arcate con cancelli di ferro, che facevansi da Francesco Petrucci, celebre artista senese noto per altri lavori di simil genere: e quelle cancellate non dovevano certamente essere povera cosa quando pagavansi all’artefice la somma, allora cospicua, di 55 fiorini d’oro.[2] Contemporaneamente Alberto Arnoldi scolpiva per l’altare della cappella la statua di Maria vergine ed i due angeli che le stanno ai lati; e questa opera conducevasi dall’illustre scolare di Andrea Pisano tra il 1359 ed il 1364, ricevendone prezzo di 280 fiorini d’oro: mentre lavorava nel tempo istesso all’altra immagine della Madonna che posa sulla porta di fianco dell’oratorio, nella piazza di S. Giovanni, la quale diè finita nel giugno del 1361 per 16 fiorini d’oro. Anche rapporto a questo fu tratto in errore il Vasari, giudicando queste scolture opera di Andrea Pisano: della qual cosa recò prova il Cicognara prima di ogni altro, ed a quelle altre io ne aggiunsi nel mio libro sopra citato, che qui, come in luogo più conveniente, riporto.[3] Gli stanziamenti dei Capitani conservano memoria delle pitture a fresco colle quali decoravansi le volte della cappella nel 1363, a cui attendevano i due dipintori Nardo e Bartolommeo: il primo dei quali fu assai probabilmente il fratello di Andrea Orcagna, e l’altro il senese Bartolommeo, creduto dei Bulgarini, che assai opere eseguì nella città di Firenze. A queste debbono aggiungersi quelle che in epoca assai posteriore, nel 1425, dipingevano Giunta e Rossello, e le altre che furono eseguite sulle pareti da Giovanni di Donnino nel 1436.[4] Non mi è noto il soggetto e neppure la forma di cotali pitture, perchè nei rammentati libri non si descrivono: ed ora non più possono vedersi, essendo nascosto dall’intonaco che vi distese sopra un imbianchino nel 1760, d’ordine d’Angiolo Maria Ricci allora rettore dell’Oratoria; a cui parve che miglior figura dovessero fare i barocchi ornati che vi fece eseguire da Stefano Fabbrini. Noi gridiamo alla barbarie: ma i nostri vecchi non pensavano cosi, e quello era il gusto del secolo. Mentre essi dipingevano le volte, si faceva il gradino da un pittore nomato Ambrogio, forse il Lorenzetti o il Baldesi: ma non è quello chè si ammira attualmente sull’altare, perche questo, opera tra le più pregevoli di Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio, fu sostituito all’antico nel 1512, allorquando fu costruito il nuovo altare ricco dei belli intagli da Antonio Carota celebre artista in quel tempo. Si ha memoria nei libri di uscita dei Capitani che Niccolò di Piero Gerini e Ambrogio di Baldese, volgendo il 1386, dipingevano sulla parete esterna dell’oratorio quel bell’affresco che ora si ammira nella stanza in cui risiede il Commissario dell’attiguo orfanotrofio di S. Maria del Bigallo, là trasferito nel 1777, rappresentante alcuni fanciulli smarriti, e tra essi diverse madri tutte festanti per vederseli restituiti dai confratelli di S. Maria della Misericordia.[5] È noto come i benefizi impartiti alla intiera città non bastassero ad impedire la rovina del pio sodalizio; avvegnachè Cosimo il vecchio dei Medici, protettore della Compagnia del Bigallo, la quale per effeto di mala amministrazione era prossima a sciogliersi, fece di maniera che nel 1425 delle due fraternite se ne formasse una sola, per potere coi redditi della Misericordia arricchire quella di cui voleva vantaggiare gl’interessi. Com’era naturale conseguenza del fatto, cessò l’esercizio delle opere pie ch’erano proprie della Misericordia; e quando dopo molti anni si rese indispensabile di richimarla a novella vita, quei che ne dettarono i nuovi statui, nel 1489, memori dei danni arrecati da Cosimo Medici, decretarono in modo che l’autorità e l’influenza dei cittadini statuali fosse minima nel luogo pio. Tornando ora alle notizie artistiche de questo luogo, debbo notare che i nuovi padroni, i Capitani del Bigallo, forse per cancellare la memore della loro usurpazione, vollero rappresentati sulle pareti esterne del palagetto sovrastante all’oratorio i fatti relativi alla loro istituzione, e vi si decisero allorquando si trovarono astretti a riedificare in gran parte la metà superiore dell’edifizio danneggiato da un furioso incendio il 23 luglio 1442. Il Lastri, il Rosselli, e il Landini attribuiscono quelle pitture a Taddeo Gaddi, ma basta per confutarli il conoscere il tempo nel quale furono condotte: Richa, Rumhör e Becchi le danno a un Piero Chellini, ma sono anch’essi in errore. Lavorò invero questo artista per il Bigallo, ma fu adoperato in opere più proprie di un imbianchino che d’un artista, siccome io dimostrai, citando i documenti, nella mia storia della beneficenza fiorentina; nel quale libro riportai ancora testualmente le memorie dalle quali si desume che Ventura di Moro e Rossello di Iacopo di Scolaio Franchi furono gli autori di questi affreschi, nel 1445.[6] Qui hanno termine le notizie artistiche de questo luogo, non stimando opportuno di addentrarmi nell’attiguo edifizio, dove pure si conservano non ispregevoli dipinture, nè di parlare delle opere di arte eseguite da Filippo di Cristofano, da Ambrogio di Baldese e da Mariotto di Nardo, per le quali tutte e pei documenti che vi si riferiscono può vedersi il rammentato mio libro sugli stabilimenti di beneficenza di questa città a pagine 9,150 e seguenti.

        "content"  : "Translation by George Bent Giuseppe Richa, Notizie Istoriche delle chiese Fiorentine VII, Bigallo, 251-65, 282-96. (251) Never have I written a history of a place so well documented as this one; and I have at my disposal two writings by diligent people intimately related to the Oratory, the company, and the magistrates of the Bigallo. The first of these, made by the order of Ferdinand II, was written by the Dr. Ambrogio Ambrogi, the Chancellor of the Magistrates of the Bigallo. The second appears in a very short but erudite letter by the Doctor Angiol Maria Ricci, lecturer of Greek at the Florentine Sapienza (the university) and Provost of the Bigallo of which we speak. And while it might seem that do not necessarily need to consult these works by minor authorities, in truth their texts illustrate some points that we do not encounter in other writings. Therefore it seems necessary to relate their comments, and the first we will consult is that by Ambrogi, who says the following: Study of the Bigallo, by Doctor Ambrogi for the Granduke II. The major Florentine confraternity of S. Maria del Bigallo was founded by Fra Pietro da Verona who, as a sixteen-year old was studying in Bologna in 1221, was favorably judged by Domenic, the patriarch of the Order of Preachers, and entered the Dominican order. After having illustrated his eloquence and goodness (252) by preaching in the principle cities of Italy, in 1252 – the same year as his glorious martyrdom in the name of the holy faith, perpetrated somewhere between Como and Milan – he was elevated by Innocent IV into the Catalog of Saints and dubbed S. Peter Martyr. For over 500 years, despite the ravages of time, the floods of the Arno, and other failures, his fame has been recognized by the public, as well as in the books of the confraternity of the Misericordia, so much that he is considered their principle saint. And it is in the Oratory that passed to the Misericordia in the Bigallo (a story we shall soon recount) that we see today a perpetual monument to the glorious ancient founder in the form of what was then considered an important painting on its façade in the Piazza di S. Giovanni that represents his most important act in our city. That is, when he commanded the nobility of Florence to defend the purity of the Holy Faith in the name of their fellow Florentines and sent them to the Piazza Santa Felicita and the Croce al Trebbio carrying with them the banner of the Vermilion Cross on the White Field – which is still preserved with reverence in S. Maria Novella. As the Dominicans tell it, they won two great victories against the Manichean heretics (the Patarini), and then erected two columns on behalf of the commune on that spot to commemorate their glorious accomplishment. At that moment the sign of the Holy Cross expelled the Devil, who fled from them in the form of a black horse sprinting ferociously from the Via de’ Feriavecchi to the Piazza Mercato Vecchio, where the saint was then preaching, in an attempt to intimidate and harass all the people who had come to hear him speak so that they could not listen to the Word of God. On behalf of the holy father and for the sake of his Inquisitor General, (253) Peter Martyr had examined the piety and spiritual exercises of the seven men who had founded the Order of the Servants of Mary, located on Mount Senario. They understood that the zeal and forbearance in the city of Florence was caused by the multitude of people there who were predisposed to do the work of divine Mercy that was so beneficial to mankind that God promised to these meritorious men a place next to him in his Kingdom of Heaven. We must understand how, from these difficult circumstances, the confraternity of noble Florentines came to care for the destitute, and how they evolved under the watchful patronage of the Virgin Mary, from whose mouth we have heard the sweet great words repeated by Peter the Apostle: Ego pro te oravi Petre, ut non deficiat fides tua. I, Peter, pray to you that my faith may not fail. III. In order to maintain the very best constitution and for the sake of the holy works of their founding father, this confraternity immediately began to pursue with ardor important things in the various areas of Charity that could help the most destitute people from cradle to adulthood. Spurred on by the urgings of priests, prelates, and even papal figures who promised them Indulgences, Privileges, and other spiritual prerogatives, more than just a few leading citizens bequeathed copious inheritances to the confraternity to fund their pious works. This constituted a sizable amount of money, large enough to provide support for those orphans and other equally poverty-stricken people who sought the aid of Jesus Christ. And this work was done from the church of S. Maria Novella from 1279 up until the residence of the Bigallo was actually constructed in honor of God, the Madonna, (254) and all the saints. IV. The company was led by a group of officials, periodically called priors, rectors, and then captains, all selected by lottery according to a quota system of two per quarter, much like the way priors were selected to govern the city in those times. Additionally, these leaders were assisted by a notary, a procurator, a chamberlain, and other figures who were brought on from time to time according to need. V. This system of officials and ministers was established long before the company had its own residence, during that period when they operated out of the churches of S. Maria Novella, S. Donato tra le Torri, Orsanmichele, and other places – including a number of hospitals that cared for the destitute. They moved from place to place until that time they were able to build their own residence in the parish of S. Bartolo nel Corso, located on property donated to them by the city of Florence that was situated next to the houses owned by the Macci family, all of which was recorded in a contract written by Ser Piero di Ser Grifo on 20 June 1352. VI. Continues to discuss the other hospitals in and around Florence….. 282 Chapter 28 The Oratory of the Bigallo, III Thanks to the learned Doctor Angelo Maria Ricci, who conveyed this information about the history of the Bigallo in a letter. I. It’s a truly marvelous thing that you’re doing to write this precise and accurate history of Florentine churches. It’s important that every Florentine read your work, not just to praise it, but to understand all the things that have been done here and what was taken from us by foreignors. II. My contribution, which concerns the great works undertaken by those in the Oratory of S. Maria del Bigallo, has been written with the sanction of the Regent (of Austria) in the name of the most August sovereign. III. Andrea Pisano made the marble statue that represents the standing Madonna with the Christ Child in her arms, which can be seen in a beautiful niche above the altar. Two marble angels are there, too, but they seem to be somewhat feminine and they wear on their heads tiaras (283) similar to the one worn by the Madonna that suggest they’re Jewish women. It’s said that a master named Antonio, called il Carota, designed the beautiful wooden altar and decorated it richly. IV. The son of Domenico Ghirlandaio painted the small scenes in the predella below. Five pictures of better quality also appear. In the middle picture is painted the Madonna smiling at two angels, with her arms and her cloak open to them. To her right and above appears Jesus Christ with his arms open; and at the feet of the Virgin one sees two bishops and other people, some religious and some secular, and then many women in different positions of veneration. At the farthest point on the right of the same painting appears the Virgin in adoration, Joseph in contemplation, and the Baby Jesus lying almost comically on a red cloak. To the left is the Virgin holding the Child in her arms while Joseph, in the lead, takes them to Egypt. V. In the painting in the Cornu Evangelii (literally, the Horn of the Evangelist) the painter created a passionately rendered figure of St. Peter Martyr dipping his finger into his own blood to write in the earth the Apostles Creed. Above we see the assassin about to commit a second crime, chasing after the frightened friar who accompanied the Saint. The assassin carries in his left hand a shield upon which appears a half scorpione and three crowns, one arranged on top of the other, fall from the sky in front of the Holy Martyr, Saint Peter. The picture in the Cornu Epistolae (literally, the Horn of the Epistle Writers) appears Tobit in an act of unearthing a corpse, helped by Tobias (his son). And here one sees in the loggia of the morgue with the old gates, that were later removed in order to wall up the area. In the painting we can see the two facades, where today appear the Porta dell’Oratorio and the one next to it. Finally, there appears a funeral bier, the sign of the Company of the Misericordia. In some of the rood screens (“tramezzi”) (284) that appear in these paintings we see two round paintings, each one bearing the coats of arms of the Company of the Bigallo – that is, with a white rooster on a blue field with the letters S. M. B. – and those of the Company of the Misericordia – that is, with a red cross on a similarly blue field with the letters F. M. E. (It’s important to note that today the coat of arms of the Misericordia appears to change the F to an R. This is because in the old script the F had a long horizontal line at the top which attached to the horizontal line below, which then seemed to form an R). Below we see seven areas filled with three large panels and four smaller ones. In the largest panel in the middle appears the Assumption of the Virgin among angels who hold flowers. In the smaller flanking panels of the Cornu Evangelii appear the figure of Tobias, the Angel, and the Fish. VI. Following along in the same area, but in one of the major pictures, we come to a painting of the Holy Virgin kneeling on the ground before the Holy Father above her, with angels surrounding them like courtiers. The nude figures of Adam and Eve join them, according to the tradition in which they are shown being judged by God. VII. In the little panel at the top of the grade appears woman, perhaps a Sybil, writing something, joined by two others in small pictures at the Cornu Epistolae. In the large panel between them is painted the Annunciation of the Virgin. VIII. Above these is a tabernacle venerated on the Feast of S. Peter Martyr, in which is a carved and gilded relief by the same Master Antonio, called il Carota. Inside the tabernacle, on the bottom part, lies a gilt bronze scene featuring a statuette of S. Peter Martyr with a knife in his cloak and a sword pushed into his right leg, and with the palm of his right hand. In the upper part appear the letters N. I. along with evidence of an A and other letters no longer visible. (285) This letters demand interpretation if we wish to understand them. In the windows of the tabernacle appears S. John the Baptist, in the back right, and Tobit in the left, painted sometime around 1510 – the same time as the other pictures here – by the same artist responsible for them: but not by Domenico Ghirlandaio, as many believe, but rather by one of his three sons – Davide, Benedetto, or Ridolfo: Domenico had been dead since 1493. At the foot of the tabernacle’s base is sculpted the martyrdom of S. Peter Martyr, in the same way that the scene appears in the painting described above. IX. In this oratory, dedicated to the Virgin Mary and therefore called S. Maria del Bigallo, people venerate also S. Peter Martyr and Tobit, as is evident by their appearance in the three paintings in the upper zone. Members celebrate solemnly the Feasts of the Annunziation, S. Peter Martyr, Tobit on the third Sunday in September, when the story of the prophet is read inside the church. Beginning with First Vespers, his feast day is observed with the ritual that doubles that of the First Class. X. The feast observed with the most pomp and solemnity, however, is that of S. Peter Martyr due to his position as founder of the Bigallo and his important preachings against the Paterini Heresy. These episodes are depicted in two extremely old paintings produced, we think, by Taddeo Gaddi in the arches on the side of the Oratory – one in the area already described and the other over the place where the banners were given to the twelve men, called the twelve Good Men of the Bigallo, to fight the heretics. Some lovely sermons were delivered about the Paterini by the Doctor Giovanni Lami, that I heard in the Accademia della Crusca. One of the banners is kept in S. Maria Novella inside a Reliquary. (286) Another that appears there is a copy of the original: it bears a red cross on a white field with a red border around it, not unlike the banner given out as a prize for horse races, except that it is smaller and has no strip. In the painting the banners don’t look like these, but that’s probably due to artistic license. The other eleven banners were famously kept in the Bigallo, but were unfortunately lost alongside many old books: there is good reason to believe they perished in the violence of flooding at some point in time. XI. Depending on need, there are four officers of the Oratory. Among their other duties is the performance of mass – including the singing of three masses each week; one on Mondays for the Dead, another on Thursdays for Peace, and the last on Saturday for the Virgin Mary. The saying of Mass on Thursdays falls on the shoulders of Mone Fantini Taverniere (or Vinattiere) to placate any civil discord. XII. But because the above mentioned number of officers are not always available to perform these solemn festivals, other priests intervene in eight other feasts of lesser importance so that the oratory becomes something like a “collegiata,” or collegiate church, if one considers the offices, masses, and choruses performed vigorously by pious and devout people, just as they were in ancient times. XIII. The Company of S. Maria del Bigallo had been founded to perform charitable works and was supported by hospitals, including that of the Misericordia that provided burials for the dead, especially during times of plague. They were initially independent, but then the Misericordia of the Bigallo came under the domain of the church of S. Cristofano, and then moved to that location where they are today, which was initially the first Residence of the Magistrate of the Wards of the State. Ferdinando del Migliore’s (287) diligent review of the archives and his use of their documents confirms this history of the first iteration of the Misericordia. XIV. At last I refer to an unusually old document in a folder of parchment in the Oratory’s archives, clearly prepared for them at their request, but undated so I don’t know precisely when it was written. It appears in a book, two-feet tall and covered in wood with golden corners, that has been finished with a triangular image that shows Jesus emerging from his tomb on one leg with arms extended with a cross behind him. The following text accompanies the image: IN THE NAME OF GOD, AMEN. THIS BUILDING IS THE HOME OF THE GREAT COMPANY FOUNDED BY SAINT PETER MARTYR ON THE DAY OF THE ASCENSION OF CHRIST IN THE YEAR 1244 TO HONOR REVERENTLY OUR GLORIOUS MOTHER, THE VIRGIN MARY. EVERY THURSDAY A MASS OF PEACE IS PERFORMED: MEMBERS OF THE COMPANY WHO ATTEND RECEIVE AN INDULGENCE FROM PURGATORY OF THREE YEARS AND 320 DAYS, GRANTED TO THEM BY THE BISHOPS OF FLORENCE – SIR GIOVANNI AND SIR GOTTIFREDI AND SIR FRANCESCO – WHO GAVE TO THE COMPANY AN ADDITIONAL TWO YEARS AND 300 DAYS OF INDULGENCES. THE VENERABLE FRIARS GENERAL AND THE ORDER OF PREACHERS MINOR AND HERMITS AND CARMELITES AND MONKS OF ALL THE ORDERS CEDED TO THEM THE THINGS THEY NEEDED FOR ALL THE LIVING AND THE DEAD OF THE WORLD. XV. (288) On the opposite side, completely painted, is another triangle with a half-length Madonna holding the Christ Child in her arms, with S. Peter Martyr on their right holding a lily in his hand and S. Francis on their left holding a book. In the space below S. Peter Martyr (standing in front of confraternity members) consigns the standard to one of them, who kneels at his feet to receive it. Other standards in different colors, already handed out to other members, appear on the opposite side. This painting seems to have been produced by someone from the school of Giotto, perhaps an assistant, who may have copied it from him. XVI. Speaking of pictures, there’s another similar standard above one of the arches, made of linen and in such poor condition that it is patched, that is now kept in S. Maria Novella. Everyone knows it is ancient. I have spoken of other things I’ve observed, but I will have to tell you about this personally some other time. From my house on 5 May 1755, your devoted servant, Angio Maria Ricci. XVII. These writers, who have studied the documents, have established an accurate account of history. But, because they have some doubts about a few points, I will address some essential things they have omitted, like the origins of the two confraternities – that is, the primary company of the Virgin Mary called the Bigallo and the old Company of the Misericordia – whose union is misunderstood because, I believe, they were both founded by S. Peter Martyr. (289) Those who oppose this argument include the above-mentioned Ambrogio, Roselli, and many others. Ferdinando del Migliore supported it, as can be seen in Firenze Illustrata, where on page 78 he writes, “Before passing over this, we must speak briefly of the other twelve hospitals under their care that were divided between two separate organizations: the first was called S. Maria del Bigallo (a.k.a. the company of S. Peter Martyr) and the other was called S. Maria della Misericordia, although both were governed by the same captains of the confraternity in Florence. This experiment lasted a long time, and with some success. But happily, in 1425 – at a time when the citizens of Florence were preoccupied with threats from outside their walls and disastrous wars threatened the state – the city fathers deliberated in the Senate and passed a law that united the two companies and formed a new entity with the name of S. Maria del Bigallo. Eight captains governed the company and placed on the façade of their residence hall their coat of arms, which was a shield divided vertically with, in one section, a red cross on a black field with the letter F, on another the letter M in a gold band, and on the third part a white rooster on a blue background with the letters S.M.B. underneath.” XVIII. Now I have reflected at length on this issue, and other difficult questions that demand explanation. For example, we wonder about the pictures of S. Peter Martyr painted by Taddeo Gaddi on the façade of the Oratory, or about identity of the person who painted the strip of the building facing the Baptistery of S. Giovanni that shows the image of the Company honoring their saintly founder. An objective critique of del Migliore’s position leads us to understand that the Bigallo, which was not yet united with the Misercorida until 1425, could not have commissioned Gaddi to paint these pictures: only the Company of the Misericordia could have done this, and yet the painter is said to have done every single picture there. Likewise wonder about the discrepancies contained in the writings about the foundation of the Bigallo, one which places it in 1240 and another in 1244, another which combines the two companies as a unified body at that early date. It’s confusing because a contract written by Ser Piero di Ser Grifo, on 28 June 1352, says that the Signoria permitted the Bigallo to build its Residence in the parish of S. Bartolo al Corso: in 1352 the Misericordia and the Bigallo were two separate entities, as del Migliore says, and the latter didn’t have a house later on. And if we said above that the captains first met in one specific place in the city, but then a different one, then it seems they didn’t have an actual Residence Hall at all, and instead went from house to house as circumstances dictated or as benefactors permitted them use. I have in my possession a document written by the Captains in S. Maria sul Prato, which says the following: “On 14 August, 1297, Mazzottus Bacherelli, Bartolus Ugolini, Ser Ciprianus q. Riccomanni, Ser Guido Spadaccii, Folchardinus Bonsignori, Ubaldinus Ardinghelli, Guido Ramaglianti, &amp;amp; Vieri Arrussi Rectores, the officers of the Society of the Blessed Virgin Mary, in concert with Corteccione the son of Iohannes de Rustici acting as official on behalf of the nuns of S. Maria del Prato in Florence: On this solemn day the above named men ceded to Corteccione the full license and deed to the Church of the Castagno held by Fra Humilis and Fra Michele for this confraternity, situated in Monte Basciano near the Caves of Verzaia, etc.” to whom it may concern; (291) and if it is the case, as it seems, that the those who received the church and land departed from it, it would all return back to the Company of the Misericordia, the original owners. Witnessed by the notary Rusticus, son of Ugonis.” XIX. Yet another problem arises when we consider the origins of the Oratory itself, the place of its original location, and its date of construction. Ambrogi says that the original Company of the Misericordia bought some houses from Baldinaccio degli Adimari at the piazza di S. Giovanni, and on this was built the Oratory and the Residence Hall. But Leopoldo del Migliore, on page 81, diverges from this argument when he writes: “There we have the different stories about the old Oratory of the Misericordia, located where there was once the Tower of the Guardamorto and the public room of the exhibition of the cadavers,” and at the same time says that the ruined tower was ceded to the Republic by S. Pieter of Verona in order to provide a place for the new Company of the Misericordia, which the Captains then used as their Oratory and Residence. Migliore depended entirely on Rosselli’s memoirs for this interpretation, and states unequivocally that the Oratory was built on top of the ruins of the tower with a strong foundation, large walls, and an impressive fortified gate, none of which could have been made for the Oratory of moderate height and weight. And we note that the delusional argument that the Oratory of the Bigallo was built between 1240 and 1244 cannot hold, because we see, on page 123 of the Malespini chronicle and on page 177 of Givoanni Villani’s text, that the tower did not collapse until 1248: Villani writes, “The Guelphs showed tremendous faith and dedication to the church, the cathedral, and the Baptistery of S. Giovanni, and they went there on Sunday mornings to worship, and had many weddings. When the Ghibellines decided to punish the Guelphs, they chose to destroy their fortress, the tower, that sat at the corner of the Corso Adimari on the piazza S. Giovanni. Designed by Nicola Pisano and called the “Torre del Guardamorto,” the tower had long been the favored resting place of the city’s leading citizens who wished to be buried by the Baptistery. The Ghibellines tore down the supports, one by one, and burned them all; but, due to the wishes of God and Saint John the Baptist, only half of the tower fell into the piazza. They then ordered the destruction of the rest of the tower, which had been 120 braccia tall.” We can see that the tower was both very close to the Baptistery of S. Giovanni and that it fell only during the sacrilegious vendetta of the Ghibellines in 1248, meaning that the Bigallo could not have participated in the building of the residence on the spot of the great architect Nicola Pisano’s ruined tower. Unfortunately, an error in a diary written by Rondinelli indicates that, “in 1411 the Oratory of the Bigallo was built on the alley of the Corso de’Brigliai.” Instead, we can see that the entirety of the Oratory’s exterior, including the colonnettes, arches, and reliefs, were clearly built much earlier than this. XX. Then when the companies of the Bigallo and the Misericordia ceded the title of the captains, they became a conspicuous magistrate of Florence, whose principle concern revolved around the care of abandoned children, as we have seen in an earlier section of this book. During the early years of the Republic, the Bigallo received orphaned boys and girls separated from their parents and homeless, as seen in various official documents and statutes (293) of the commune, as for example under the rubric 117 of book 3, where we see the following words: “Whoever found unattended children wandering through the streets brought them to the house of the Misercordia in the Piazza Orsanmichele, the official orphanage sanctioned by the commune;” as well a these by Fra Domenico da Corella in his Theotocon from ca. 1460: “Thus my tiny house was visited by the Madonna who has no pity. This is what happens when children are abandoned, for should the parent perish there’s no telling what could happen to them. But they should be protected under a safe roof until they can be restored to their parents. This is what is expected in our pious city.” XXI. And as I have already written of principle parts of this story, it’s appropriate to comment at last on some paintings inside, owned by the Bigallo but maintained by the aforementioned Dr. Angelo Maria Ricci, who is the head of the small but important collegiata. And therefore we consider a large picture above the great doorway into the building, painted in fresco, that represents a mourning mother (who has surrendered her child) in the midst of a variety of beautifully depicted orphans. She happily comes to receive her children from the captains of the Bigallo, and stands among the houses and towers that appeared there in those days, as is noted in a document of 1444, on page 8 in book X of the Bigallo’s archives, where one also sees the name of the painter: “1444 June 1. The Captains of the Bigallo and Misericordia order that payment be made from the orphanage to the painter, Piero Chellino, for the remainder of the work he has done to produce the painting on the façade of the captain’s residence.” In the corridor of the main Audience Hall are some damaged paintings, blackened and broken not unlike those that occupy all the sections across from the Porta del Magistrato, (294) that were not intended to be seen this way. On the level of the stairs, four feet up toward the second floor, appears a Christ rising up out of his tomb with his arms open, holding in a sense a multitude of people seeking mercy; underneath are two inscriptions written in Gothic script that say, “Oh, all you who pass this way, come inside and see my son on the cross who has died for your sins. If you have sinned, beg for mercy and you shall receive it. O sinners, it is because you have not wept for your sin that here you see the death of our Lord Jesus Christ who was crucified for your salvation. You would be wise to pray to the Mother of Mercy.” XXII. And to the right of this door one sees and extremely old picture in fresco of a giant figure of the Madonna of Mercy, shown as a loving person wearing a cope and a round mitre on her head, with a fine stole, and at her feet are some worshippers from the Misericordia, with Longobard writing. This figure carries an air of a patron saint, with kneeling people on either side of a representation of Florence as it then appeared within the second circuit of city walls. The painter of this image explained his message in an inscription written in quasi-gothic hand that has a touch of antiquity to it, which states, “All mercies and good works are done in this place according to the wise actions of its members, 1352.” (295) Leaving this loggia, on the right hand side, are six hooks on the wall, two steps up the stairs and about six feet high, that according to tradition were used during the attack on the cathedral when S. Peter Martyr preached in the Piazza di S. Giovanni. We don’t have any way to confirm this, other than the sayings of some old people, but we’ll leave it up to the judgment of people to decide for themselves whether this is true. And on the door of the Audience Hall, by the coat of arms of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, appears an inscription that states, “The most serene Cosimo the Great, Duke of Etruria; pious men affectionately serve to receive abandoned children, and then return them to worthy people who will care for them.” XXIII. And here we reach of this story, where I must refer to the enormous struggles in and around Florence during the years of the plague that engendered so many tremendous charitable acts by our confraternity in the face of mass slaughter. The first occurred during the famine of 1325 caused by the war of the Altopascio; the second in 1340 that carried away a sixth of the population, many of them members of the nobility; the third was seven years later, in the year 1348 when the Black Death arrived and killed one hundred thousand souls, including the famous historian Giovanni Villani. His brothers, Matteo and Giovanni, succumbed to the plague of 1363, which was followed by two others that century, one in 1374 and the other in 1383. It came back again in 1400, this time called the Plague of the Bianchi after a certain flagellant confraternity that processed through the countryside, and again killed a lot of people. The ninth (sic) plague came in 1411 and the tenth (sic) in 1417, which killed 16 thousand more. There were others in 1422, 1430, and 1437. Another called the “Anguinata” came in 1449 and swept through the countryside. It was followed by one in 1465 – the sixteenth great mortality – and another in 1479 – the seventeenth – that took away Marsilio Ficino, author of the famous illustrated book called The Cure for Plague. Another three came in 1495, 1498, and 1509, although they were minor. The most ferocious and lengthy of them all lasted from 1525 to 1527, which Varchi says killed an almost infinite number of men. After this the city was preserved from plague for 103 years, until in 1630 when a new one was discovered in Milan, which traveled to the gates of Bologna, and then hit Florence hard. The Misericordia was active in those days, like its descendent is today, and received the praise of the people who came to it in times of need – and also in the final stages of plague – to find some peace. Long Live the Company of the Misericordia! But, of course, this was not the last of the plagues, for yet another returned in 1633: but thanks to the diligence of the Grand Duke Ferdinand, who knew enough about previous plagues to quarantine the entire city, the people were saved and the health of Italy was preserved thanks to the love, power, and diligence of the Prince. &amp;lt;/hr&amp;gt; Giuseppe Richa, Notizie Istoriche delle chiese Fiorentine VII, Bigallo, 251-65, 282-96. Sino=until Medesimo=same 251 – I. Non mai ho scritto Istoria tanto ben corredata di autorevoli documenti, quanto la presente; imperciocchè sono presso di me, di due illustri Persone diligentissime relazioni, o si voglia dell’Oratorio, o della Compagnia, o del Magistrato del Bigallo; la prima di dette Scritture fu fatta per ordine di Ferdinando II dal Dottore Ambrogio Ambrogi Cancelliere del Magistrato del Bigallo; la seconda consiste in una cortesissima, ed erudita lettera del Signor Dottore Angiol Maria Ricci, Lettor di lingua Greca nella Sapienza Fiorentina, e Proposto del medesimo Bigallo all’Autor di questa Storia. E per vero dire non abbisognavano queste Lezioni di minore autorità; avvegnachè per illustrar alcuni punti incontransi difficultà di non leggiero momento. Quindi necessario mi sembra il riportare qui amendue, e il primo document sia quell dell’Ambrogi, che dice come appresso: Relazione del Dotore Ambrogi al Granduca Sopra il Bigallo II. La Compagnia Maggiore di S. Maria del Bigallo della Città di Firenze fu fondata da quell Fra Pietro da Verona, che nell’anno 1221, sedicesimo di sua vita, mentre studiava in Bologna, fu ricevuto dal Patriarca S. Domenico nella sua novella Religione de’Predicatori, e dopo l’havere illustrate le principali Città d’Italia con la sua dottrina, eloquenza, e bontà, chiaro (252) per molti miracoli, sotto Innocenzio IV nell’istesso anno 1252 del suo glorioso Martirio sostenuto tra Como, e Milano per la dilatazione della Santa Fede, meritò di essere annoverato nel Catalogo de’Santi sotto nome di S. Pier Martire: così per continuata tradizione di circa 500 anni ne corre sino al presente pubblica la fama, et anco i libri più antichi della medesima Compagnia, che l’ingiuria del tempo, l’inondazioni d’Arno non hanno totalmente laceri, e guasti, affermano questo gran Santo esserne stato l’autore e il principio. E l’istesso Oratorio da che passò dalla Compagnia della Misericordia in questa del Bigallo, nel modo che si vedrà poco appresso, ci rappresenta sino oggi a perpetua memoria di sì glorioso Fondatore un’antica, e secondo que’ tempi non mediocre pittura nella maggior facciata sulla Piazza di S. Giovanni, rappresentante la più memoranda azione, che egli operò nella nostra Città; cioè quando a que’nobili Fiorentini da lui schierati per difendere la purità della Santa Fede con cui si viveva in Firenze, diede il Gonfalone della Croce Vermiglia in campo bianco, che sino al presente con molta venerazione si conserva in Santa Maria Novella, con il quale su la Piazza di Santa Felicita, e dalla Croce al Trebbio, come largamente raccontano I’Istorie Domenicane, ottennero contro gli Eretici Manichei quelle due gran vittorie, delle quali fin’ora con due colonne erette dal Popolo Fiorentino ne’detti due medesimi luoghi, dove furono ottenute, si conserva gloriosa la ricordanza. E quando con il segno della Santa Croce fece sparer di subito il Demonio, che in forma visibile di un nero e sfrenato Cavallo, velocemente correndo dalla Via de’Feriavecchi alla Piazza di Mercato Vecchio, dove era il Santo a predicare, tentava di intimorire e sbaragliare il Popolo, che quasi senza numero vi era congregato al solito per ascoltarlo, e così d’impedire il frutto della parola d’Iddio. Haveva veduto il Santo Padre, e per ragione del suo offizio di generale Inquisitore (253) diligentemente haveva esaminato il gran progresso nella via dello spirit, che tra le solitudini di Monte Senario andavano facendo i sette Nobili Contemplativi Fondatori dell’Ordine de i Servi di Maria, e per il zelo, che teneva della salvezza de’prossimi, poteva eziamdio haver considerate, che la Città di Firenze non meno abbondava di Persone con ingenita attitudine agevolmente disposta all’Opere della Misericordia Corporali, che infinitamente giovevoli al genere umano, et al Signore Iddio accettissime, costituiscono gli Uomini meritevoli appresso alla sua Divina pieta, del Regno de’Cieli. Onde dobbiamo di facile persuaderci, che da tali considerazioni incitato, ereggesse questa Compagnia di Nobili Fiorentini Secolari per sovvenimento delle Persone miserabili, ponendola con viva fede di memoranda progressi sotto il Patrocinio di Maria sempre Vergine, dalla cui bocca era stato favorite di udire quelle dolci, e gran parole, che già all’altro Pietro Principe degli’Apostoli haveva detto l’Incarnato Vergo: Ego pro te oravii Petre, ut non deficiat fides tua. III. Questa Compagnia per le ottime constituzioni, e per i divini ammaestramenti del suo buon Padre e Fondatore, cominciò subito con ardore così grande ad esercitarsi in tutte le Opere di Carità per sovvimento delle persone miserabili, che sino ne’suoi teneri natali si acquistò il nome di Maggiore. Fu da’ Sommi Pontefici, da molti Prelati di Santa Chiesa, e Superiori di Religioni adornata d’Indulgenze, di Privilegi, e d’altre spirituali prerogrativi, e da non pochi Cittadini gli fu fatto di grossi legati, lasciate copiose eredità, e raccomandata l’esecuzione in perpetuo di pie disposizioni. Onde costituitasi una non mediocre sostanza, potette sempre assai largamente porgere aiuto alle miserabili fanciulle in sussidio di loro Dore (?), et in ogni altra maniera soccorrere alle necessità de’poveri di Gesù Cristo; e sino talora concerere alle gran fabbriche, che si ereggevano in onore di Dio, della sua Santa (254) Madre, e de’suoi Santi, come in specie seguì l’anno 1279, per l’Opera di Santa Maria Novella. IV. Era governata tempo per tempo da alcuni Ofiziali, che da principio si chiamarono Priori, e Rettori, e dipoi Capitani, quali si traevano dale borse, due per Sestiere, o per Quartiere, secondo che per i tempi si governava la Città; e di più haveva un Notaio, un Provveditore, un Camarlingo, et altri Ministri, secondo il bisogno. V. Si adunavano questi Offiziali, e Ministri, mentre la Compagnia per ancora non haveva luogo proprio, nella Chiesa di S. Maria Novella, e di S. Donato tra le Torri, da Orsammichele, et in altri luoghi, ma specialmente nelli Spedali alla lor Cura sottoposti, sin che si fabbricarno Residenza proporzionata nel Popolo di S. Bartolo nel Corso, accanto alle case de’Macci, sopra il terrento donatoli dal Comune di Firenze per Instrumento rogato Ser Piero di Ser Grifo, 20 Giugno 1352.   282 Lezione XXVII Dell’Oratorio del Bigallo III Lettera del Chiarissimo Signor Dottore Angelo Marie Ricci Proposto del Bigallo, all’Autore della Storia. I. Meritevoli per vero dire di molta lode sono le sue premure di compilare un’esatta Istoria delle Chiese Fiorentine, ed è ben giusto, che ogni Fiorentino, non solo le faccia applause, e le professi una grata riconoscenza, ma si adoperi eziandio in somministrarle notizie, e alleggerirle alcun poco una sì grave fatica, che con gran maraviglia di chi ben riflette, Ella, che da altra patria trasse l’origine, ha coraggiosamente intrapresa. II. Ecco pertanto, che io dalla mia parte contribuisco alla sua grand’Opera qualche coserella a me nonta intorno all’Oratorio di Santa Maria del Bigallo, di cui pochi mesi sono, conferita mi fu dall’Imperial Reggenza in nome dell’Augustissimo Sovrano la Prepositura. III. Una Statua di marmo, al naturale rappresentante la Madonna in piedi col Bambino in collo, che si vede in una bella nicchia elevate sovra l’Altare, è lavoro di Andrea Pisano. Vi sono dale bande due creduti Angioli pur di marmo, ma oltre al non aver l’ale, la lor sembianza par piurtosto femminile, ed hanno in testa la mitra delle Donne Ebree, ch si vede (283) de similmente in capo all suddetta Statua della Vergine. L’adornamento di tutto quanto l’Altare è di legname dorato, molto vago e ricco, opera, dice il Migliore, d’un tale Messer Antonio detto il Carota. IV. Due sono I gradi sottoposti dipinti con vari quadretti da alcuno de’Figli di Domenico Ghierlandaio. Facendomi dal grado superior, cinque sono gli spartimenti, o dir vogliamo I quadretti. Nel quadretto di mezzo è dipinta la Madonna colle braccia aperte, e col manto disteso, sorretto da due Angioli. A man destra per di sopra è Gesù Cristo col Costato aperto; a’ piedi poi della Vergine si vedono da una banda due Vescovi, e altre Persone, parte Religiose, e parte Secolari, e dall’Altra molte femmine in diverse guise ammantate. Di più dalla parte destra del medesimo quadretto è dipinta la Vergine in atto di adorazione, S. Giuseppe in atto di contemplazione, e Gesù Bambino giacente in terra sur uno Strato rosso in atto quasi scherzoso. Dalla sinistra poi la Madonna col Bambino in collo, che va in Egitto, e S. Giuseppe avanti, che fa la guida. V. Nel quadretto in Cornu Evangelii effigiò il Pittore con viva espressione S. Pier Martire già ferito, inginocchioni, che scrive in terra col ditto intinto nel proprio sangue il Credo, e sopra si mira il fiero Sicario, che gli avventa un altro colpo, e il Frate compagnio del Santo, che spaventato se ne fugge. Il Sicario tiene colla mano sinistra uno scudo avente in mezzo uno scorpione, e tre corone calano giù dal Cielo una sopra l’altra per ornar la fronte al Santo Martire. Nel quadretto in Cornu Epistolae v’ è Tobbia in atto di sotterrare un morto, aiutato da Tobbiolo. E qui si vede la loggia del Guardamorto colle cancellate antiche, che furon poi levate, e alzate in luogo di loro le pareti. Si vedono parimente le due facciate, cioè quella dove è la Porta dell’Oratorio, e l’altra laterale. Per ultimo è figurate da una banda la Compagnia della Misericordia col cataletto. Ne I tramezzi (284) de’quadretti descritti vi sono due tondi, ognuno de’quali porta le Armi della Compagnia di Santa Maria del Bigallo, che è un Gallo bianco in Campo azzurro con le tre lettere S. M. B. e della Comagnia della Misericordia, che è una Croce rossa in campo similmente azzurro, con le due lettere F. M. E. qui si vuol notare, che inoggi nell’Arme della Misericordia la lettera F è stata cangiata in R; il che è addivenuto perchè avendo l’F nella scrittura antica uno svolazzo all’ingiù nella linea orizzontale superiore, questo essendosi allungaro, e attaccato colla linea orizzontale inferiore, ha forma un R. Il grado inferiore ha sette spartimenti: Tre sono I quadretti maggiori, e Quattro I minori. Nel quadretto maggiore di mezzo è l’Assunta con molti Angioli, che spargono fiori. Nel quadrettino allato in Cornu Evangelii evvi Tobbiolo, l’Angiolo, e il Pesce. VI. Segue dalla medesima parte altro quadretto maggiore, ove è dipinta la Vergine Santissima genuflessa in terra, il Padre Eterno al disopra, e dale bande Angioli, che la corteggiano; giciono in terra nudi colle sole fasce alle parti verende Adamo, ed Eva, secondo che verisimilmente si giudica. VII. Nel quadrettino, che segue in cima del grado, v’è una Donna, che scrive, e si crede essere una Sibilla, siccome pure ne’due quadrettini in Cornu Epistolae sembrano espresso due sibille, e nel quadretto maggiore posto fra essi, è dipinta la Nunziata. VIII. Sopra questi gradi si colloca nella Festa di S. Pier Martire un Tabernacolo assai leggiadro alto un braccio in circa di fino intaglio, e doratura, lavoro forse del medesimo Maestro Antonio detto il Carota, dentro al quale è incassata una Macchinetta di bronzo dorato, nel cui mezzo è la Statuetta di S. Pier Martire col cultello in capo, e colla spade ficcata nell’omero destro, e colla palma nella mano destra. Nella superior parte della Macchinetta vi sono le lettere N.I. e alquanto più su evvi un A, e altre lettere, che non (285) si leggono. Il mettersi a interpetrare queste lettere, è lo stesso, che il voler far da indovno. Il Tabernacolo ha i suoi sportellini, nel destro de’quali per di dentro è dipinto S. Gio. Batista, nel sinistro S. Tobbia, e comecchè v’è il millesimo, cioè 1510 per questo penso, che anche le pitture de’gradi, che paiono della medesima, mano, non sieno di Domenico Ghirlandaio, come molti vogliono, ma di alcuno de’tre suoi Figli David, Benedetto, Ridolfo, poichè Domenico morì nel 1493. A piè della base della macchinetta è scolpito il martirio di S. Pier martire, nella stessa guise che si vede dipinto nel quadretto del grado descritto di sopra. IX. In quest’Oratorio dedicato alla Vergine, che però chiamasi di Santa Maria del Bigallo, si venerano come contitolari s. Pier Martire, e S. Tobbia, come accennano le tre pitture del grado superiore: onde, solennenmente vi si celebra la Festa della Assunzione, la Festa di S. Pier Martire, e la Festa di S. Tobbia il giorno della Domenica 3 di Settembre, quando la Chiesa pone nel Divino Ufizio il libro della Storia del medesimo. In esso giorno adunque si fa la sua Festa, cominciando da i primi Vespri, con rito di doppio di prima Classe. X. La Festa però, che con maggior pompa dell’altre si solennizza, è quella di S. Pier Martire, poichè dicesi essere stato l’Autore dell’instituto del Bigallo, ed avere in questo angolo principalmente predicato contro l’Eresia de’Paterini, vedendosi due dipinture molto antiche, di mano (credesi) di Taddeo Gaddi sopra gli archi della parte laterale dell’Oratorio, in una delle quali predica, e nell’altra consegna gli Stendardi a 12 Uomini (che furon detti i 12 Buoni Uomini del Bigallo) per combattere contro i detti Eretici. Sopra i Paterini compose già alcune bella Lezioni il Signor Dottore Giovanni Lami, da me con piacere udite nell’Accademia della Crusca. Uno de’mentovati Stendardi conservasi in Santa Maria Novella frall’altre venerabili Reliquie: per altro non pare a taluno (286) essere l’antico, ma altro rifatto su quell modello: il suddetto Stendardo è bianco con croce rossa, la quale piglia tutta l’estensione di esso, e con orlo rosso intorno intorno, ed è il simile al palio, che si pone per premio nella corsa de’Cavalli, salvo che è più piccolo, e non ha striscia. Nella pittura suddetta le bandiere non son fatte così, ma si può supporre una libertà pittoresca. E’ fama che gli altri undici si serbassero nel Bigallo, e andassero male in alcuna delle piene, in cui moli antichi libri ancora perissero; e in fatti in cattivo stato ridotto, e dalla belletta gusto si vede alcuno di essi, che potè alla violenza dell’acque ritogliersi(?). XI. Quattro sono i Cappellani, che ufiziano l’Oratorio, e dipendono da un Proposto. Oltre agli oblighi delle Messe piane, son tenuti a cantare tre messe la Settimana, il Lunedì de Morti, il Giovedì della Pace, e il Sabato della Madonna. L’obbligo della Messa della pace dicesi lasciato da Mone Fantini Taverniere, o Vinattiere mosso dagli avvenimenti funesti delle civili discordie. XII. Ma perchè il suddetto numero di Cappelanni riuscirebbe scarso per le tre Feste solenni accennate, vi sono altri Preti fino al numero di 12 che allora intervengono, e in altre Feste di non tanta solennità ne intervengono otto, talchè questo Oratorio viene ad avere quasi una Collegiata di non così leggier conto, se si consideri l’Ufiziatura continovata delle Messe, e del Coro, che ab antico è quivi stabilità, in vigore, de’ lasciti delle piè, e divote Persone. XIII. La Compagnia di Santa Maria del Bigallo ebbe origine della carità, e cura degli Spedali: quella della Misericordia dal raccogliere i Morti, e dar loro Sepoltura, specialmente in tempo di peste. Erano da prima unita, ma poi furono separate, e quella della Misericordia dal Bigallo passò alla Chiesa di S. Cristofano, e quindi al luogo, dove di presente, che era prima la Residenza del Magistrato de i Pupilli. Il Migliore (287) tratta prima della Misericordia veechia, poi della nuova, onde da esso, e da altri documenti la sua industriosa instancabile diligenza potrà assembrare sicure notizie, da formare una, o più aggradevoli, e utili Lezioni. XIV. Per ultimo le trasmetto la copia d’una Cartella, che è appesa nell’Oratorio di caratteri d’oro antichi, che essendo logori prima che si dileguassero affatto, fu avvedutamente ordinate, che si rifiorissero, ma non so precisamente in qual tempo. Ella è scritta in un quadro di legno con cornice dorata alto un braccio in circa, e nella parte superiore finisce in un triangolo, nel quale è dipinto un Gesù rito colle gambe nel sepolcro, e colle braccia aperte, e dietro ad esso è la Croce, sulla quale par, che stia appoggiato: quel che è scritto nel quadro dice così: AL NOME DI DIO AMEN. QUEST E LA CONPAGNIA MAGIORE FATTA EDIFICATA PER NOBILE SAN PIETRO MARTIRE AD ONORE E REVERENZIA DELLA NOSTRA GLORIOSA MADRE VERGINE MARIA NELL ANNO MCCXLIIII IL DI DELLA SENSIONE E FA DIRE ONGNI GIOVEDI LA MESSA DELLA PACE E CHI E DI QUESTA CONPANGNIA A TRE AN. E CCCXX DI DI PERDONANZA E DA PIEDO SARANNO TUTTE LE PERDONANZE LE QUALI SONO CONCEDUTE A LA DETTA COMPANGNIA IN PRIMA E VESCOVI DI FIRENZE MESSER GIOVANNI E MESSER GOTTIFREDI E MESER FRANCESCHO CONCEDETONO A LA DETTA COMPAGNIA DUE ANNI E CCC DI DI PERDONO APRESSO I VENERABOLI FRATI GENERALI E MAGIORI E L’ORDINE PREDICATORI EMMORI (cioè e minori) E ROMITANI E CARMINO E MONACI E DI TUTTI GLI ORDINI CONCEDETONO CHE FOSONO PARTEFICI A TUTTI I BENI CHE SI FACESSE PER TUTTO IL MONDO VIVI E MORTI. XV. (288) La parte opposta, o dir vogliamo il rovescio è tutto dipinto, essendovi nel triangolo la Madonna nel mezzo col Bambino in collo, alla cui destra sta S. Pier Martire con un giglio in mano, e alla sinistra S. Franesco, che tiene un libro. Nello spazio sottoposto del quadro, S. Pier Martire (dietro al quale è il frate suo Compagno) consegna lo Stendardo ad uno, che è inginocchiato a’suoi piedi in atto di ricerverlo, e gli altri cogli Stendardi già ricevuti sta ritti a dirimpetto con abito talare, ma di diversi colori. Tutta questa pittura pare della scuola di Giotto, cioè di alcuno de’suoi Scolari, e qui ne diamo una copia. XVI. Parlando d’altra pittura consimile, che è sopra uno degli Archi, nominai lo Stendardo, che si conserva in Santa Maria Novella, aggiungo ora, che è di tela rada di lino, che rassomiglia il filondente, ed è rattoppato. Nulla dimeno vi ha chi non crede esser l’antico. Avrei da dirle alcune altre cose da me osservate, ma gliele portrò un giorno comunicare in voce. Son con vero ossequio: Di Casa 5 Maggio 1755 Suo Devotissimo Servitor Angio Maria Ricci. XVII. Degli Scrittori soprallodati, pregiatissimi per vero dire sono i documenti, e insieme utilissimi, onde stabilire la verità della Storia. Ma perchè sopra alcune cose riferite da i ricordati Scrittori ne possono nascere gravi dubbiezze, mi farò dal punto il più difficile, ma essenziale, qual è l’origine delle due Compagnie, vale a dire della Compagnia maggiore di Maria Vergine chiamata poi del Bigallo, e della Compagnia detta della Misericordia vecchia, standosi forte in dubbio, se dal principio queste due Compagnie fossero una sola, o almeno, come io credo, tra se presto unitesi, (289) poichè amendue riconoscevano per Fondatore San Pier Martire. Per l’opinione negative son il suddetto Ambrogi, e Rosselli, e molti altri: per l’affirmativa trovasi Leopoldo del Migliore nella Firenze Illustrata, dove dice a c. 78 come segue, “E qui si deve avvertire, prima di passer avanzi, che doppo quest’unione come d’altri dodici spedali raccomandati sotto alla medesima cura seguì il dividersene le ragioni in due Corpi destinti, uno sotto il medessimo nome, e titolo di S. Maria del Bigallo alias di San Pier Martrie, e l’altro di S. Maria della Misericordia, ambidue al governo di Capitani. Il che sperimentatosi con lungo andare uno servare, e tor di vita la virtù, corroborante l’unioni delle cose, e per tale conosciutosi da Padri, arrivata che fù la Repubblica felicemente all’Anno 1425 in cui par più che in altro tempo, i Fiorentini non combattuti dall’eiterne, e disastrose brighe di Guerra sostero intenti fuor di modo a riaccomodar lo stato loro, e l’interne direzioni della Città appoggiate al giudiziio delle Leggi, si deliberò in Senato, che le predette due Compagnie si riunistero insieme sotto un medesimo nome di S. Maria del Bigallo, da governarsi da otto Capitani risendenti collegialmente a guisa di Magistrato, e che un segno esteriore ne fosse l’Armi loro ridotte in uno Scudo solo diviso per lo lungo in parte, da una la Croce rossa in Campo nero con un F, e dall’altra un M d’oro dalle bande, e dall’altra un Gallo bianco in azzurro con lettere sotto S.M.B.” XVIII. Ora questa opinione io penso di appigliarmi sul riflesso, che così meglio si dichiarao parecchie cose difficili, come per esempio le pitture di S. Pier Martire fatta da Taddeo Gaddi nella facciata esteriore dell’Oratorio, dalla banda, che guarda San Giovanni, delle quali con maggiore facilità ne intendiamo il fine di chi le ffece colorire, cioè la Compagnia in onore del Santo suo fondatore, laddove se ci allontaniamo dal parere del Migiore, e vogliamo distinte, e separata le Compagnie, il Bigallo non avrebbe potuto far lavorare dal Gaddi le dette dipinture, mentrechè non prima dell’anno 1425 diventò il Bigallo unico Padrone di questo luogo, nè poteva comandare tal (290) fattura sopra casa non sua, ma che era della Compagnia della Misericordia, e però ogni altro Santo si arebbe fatto da essa dipignere: In tal guise ancora noi combiniamo la varietà degli Scrittori nell’assengare l’anno della fondazione del Bigallo, volendo alcuni che fosse il 1240 ed altri il 44 che se giudichiamo le due suddette Compagnie ne’primi anni unite, possiamo stabilire nel 40 prinicpiata una di esse, ed ivi pure l’altra nel 44 e sullo stesso sistema troviamo la cagione perchè la Signoria nel 1352 per contratto rogato da Ser Piero di Ser Grifo ne’ 28 di Giugno, desse al Bigallo, terreno per fabbricarsi la sua Residenza là vicino a S. Bartolo al Corso, done se ne deduce forte congettura, che appunto in quell’anno 52 o in quell torno si separassero, giusta il Migliore, le due Compagnie, altrimenti siamo costretti a dire, che la Compagnia del Bigallo per cento, e più anni non avesse mai avuto casa in Firenze. E se abbiamo detto di sopra, che I Capitani di essa si radunaveano ora in un luogo della Città, ed ora in altro, da ciò non sembra buona illuzione il dire, che non avessero propria Residenza, imperciocchè andavano in varie Chiese, o di loro dipendenza, o da essi beneficiate in certe occasioni di fare varie provvisioni; ed io ne ho una presso di me fatta da’detti Capitani in Santa Maria sul Prato, che dice come segue: “1297 15 Aug. Nos Mazzottus Bacherelli, Bartolus Ugolini, Ser Ciprianus 4 Riccomanni, Ser Guido Spadaccii, Folchardinus Bonsignori, Ubaldinus Ardinghelli, Guido Ramaglianti, &amp;amp; Vieri Arrussi Rectores, sive Capitanei maioris Societatis B.

Michael pro ipsa Societate posit. in Monte Basciano prope Cavas de Verzaia etc.” a chi l’avesse volute; (291) e se si fosse dato il caso, che quelli, a chi fosse stata conceduta la Chiesa, e il luogo, si partissero, vollero, che ipso facto l’uno, e l’altro luogo alla Compagnia Maggiore ritornasse. Ego Rusticus Not. Q. Ugonis. XIX. Altro dubbio ora ci occorre da illustrare, riguardante l’Oratorio, che non è assai certo su qual terreno, e quando fosse fabbricato, dicendo a questo proposito l’Ambrogi, che la Compagnia della Misericordia antichissima, comperò alcune Case da Baldinaccio degli Adimari sopra la Piazza di San Giovanni, e su di esse edificasse ella il suo Oratorio, e Residenza: ma Leopoldo del Migliore a c. 81 diversamente la discorre come appresso, “in su la cantonata è l’Oratorio della Misericordia vecchia, situate appunto dove fu già la Torre del Guardamorto, e la Stanza pubblica all’esposizione de’Cadaveri,” e dal medesimo ivi dicesi, che la detta Torre rovinata che su, fosse conceduta dalla Repubblica a San Pietro da Verona per trasferirvi la sua novella Compagnia, da I cui Capitani fu il luogo ridotto ad uso di Oratorio, e di Residenza. Uniformamente al Migliore scrisse pure il Rosselli nella sua memoria, tendo egli per cosa certa, che sopra il sito della suddetta Torre fosse eretto l’Oratorio, ed al sentiment di amendue favorevole sarrebbe la pianta del sotterraneo, avente muraglie grossissime, ed un barbacane stupendo, i quali non furono murati certamente per servizio dell’Oratorio, che essendo di mediocre altezza, non richiedeva somiglianti fondamenta. E per dirre alcunchè dell’anno della erezione dell’Oratorio del Bigallo, noteremo qui l’abbaglio preso primieramente da parecchi, che scrisseroessersi principiata la detta Fabbrica nel 1240 o al più 44 posciachè abbiamo da Ricordano Malespini a pag 123 e da Giovanni Villani a pag. 177 che solamente nel 1248 cadesse detta Torre, e le parole del Villani sono le sequenti, “Ancora mostrarono maggiore ampiezza per cagione, che e’Guelfi faceano di loro molto capo alla Chiesa, et Duomo di S. Giovanni (292) et tutta la buona gente usava quivi la Domenica mattina, e faceanuisi molti matrimoni. Quando vennero a disfare la fortezza de’Guelfa (cioè le Torri) intra l’altre un’alta, et bella Torre, che era in su la Piazza di S. Giovanni all’entrare nel Corso degli Adimari, la quale si chiamava la Torre del Guardamorto, perchè anticamente tutta la buona gente che moriva, si seppelliva a S. Giovanni, i Ghibellini facendo tagliar da piè della detta Torre (da Niccola Pisano) sì la fecero puntellare per modo, che quando si mettesse fuoco ne’puntelli cadesse sopra il Duomo di San Giovanni, et arsi i puntelli, come piacque a Dio, et a Messer Santo Giovanni, cadde la Torre per lo mezzo della Piazza, et apparve manifestamente, che la Torre si ravvolse, e schifo di non cadere, dove haveano ordinato, la qual Torre era alta CXX braccia.” Quindi si fa ragione, che non solamente vicinissima fosse la detta Torre a S. Giovanni, ma che non prima del 1248 anno della vendetta sacrilege de’Ghibellini, non poteva il Bigallo aver principiato il suo edifizio sulle rovine delle Torri, la cui demolizione arrecò a Niccola Pisano lode di grande Architetto. E dale suddette Notizie chiaro appare lo sbaglio di un Diario, che trovo tra le Scritture del Rondinelli, che scrisse, “1411 si fabbrica l’Oratorio del Bigallo sul canto del Corso de’Brigliai.” Oltredichè il lavoro esterno di questo Oratorio o sieno le colonnette, o l’arco, o i rilievi, dichiarano manifestamente questo esser fabbrica di maniera più antica. XX. Quando poi la Compagnia di Santa Maria del Bigallo, e della Misericordia, cessato il titolo dei Capitani, diventasse un cospicuo Magistrato di Firenze, il cui principale ufizio è la sollecita cura, e governo degli Abbandonati, nella prima lezione ne siamo andati istruiti, ma notar qui mi giova, che nell’antico ancora dalla Repubblica furono al Bigallo raccomandati i Fanciulli, e Fanciulle o smarrite o derelitte, come ne parlano varie Provvisioni del Comune, (293) e lo Statuto Fiorentino sotto la rubric 117 del libro 3 con le seguenti parole: Quicumque invenerit aliquos Pueros, vel puellas vagantes sine custodia, reneatur representare, &amp;amp; assignare in Platea Orti S. Michaelis, vel apud Domam Misericordie ufficiali deputato per dictum Commune; e da Fra Domenico da Corella così ne fu scritto circa al 1460 nel suo Theotocon: Unde pusilla mihi Domus est adeunda Marie Proxima que nomen Commiserantis habet. Hec tenet ambiguo Pueros errore vagantes Ne patria pereat nescia turba laris. Tuta sed hec fido maneat sub culmine, donec Reddantur patribus pignora chara suis. Talis enim nostra mos hic servatur in Urbe Preferri religuis que pietate solet. XXI. E già schiariti i prinicipali punti della Storia, non sarà certamente disconveniente cosa l’accennare qui per fine alcune dipinture intra lasciate dal Sig. Proposto Dottore Angelo Maria Ricci, perchè non pertinenti al suo Oratorio, dove Egli è capo di una piccolo, ma riguardevole Collegiata. E però consideramo una pittura grande sopra il Portone al di fuori dipinta a fresco, rappresentante in varie, e belle attitudini, dove molti Fanciulli smarriti, e dove delle Madri chi afflitta per la perdita del figlio, e chi in aria allegra per vederselo restituire da’Capitani del Bigallo, veggendosi in tale dipintura molte case, e Torri all’uso di que’tempi, cioè del 1444 come trovasi notato al lib. X pag. 8 nell’Archivio del medesimo Bigallo, dove si legge anche il nome del Pittor e dice, 1444 1 Iunii Capitanei S. Marie virginis, &amp;amp; Misericordie del Bigallo &amp;amp;c ordinano pagarsi diversi obblighi del loro Spedale etc. Item Piero Chellino Pictori proresto totius sue Picture facte in Domo habitationis Captineorum in facie exteriori. Nell’andito dell’Udienza sonovi alquante Pitturre vetuste, come quelle che occupano tutta la parete addirimpetto alla Porta del Magistrato, ma (294) così annerite, e guaste, che non è sperabile l’arrivare ad intenderle: sul piano della scala, che con due braccia conduce al piano superior, vedesi un Cristo ritto(?) nel Sepolcro, colle braccia aperte, tenente nel seno una moltitudine di gente per esprimere la Misericordia, e sotto due Cartelli di caratieri gottici, che dicono: O VOI GENTE, CHE PER VIA PASSATE, INTRATE DENTRO, E QVI RIGVARDATE IL MIO FIGLVOLO IN CROCE POSTO PE’ VOSTRI PECCATI È COSÌ MORTO. SE VOI DE’ PECCATI VI PENTETE MISERICORDIA DA LVI AVRETE. O PECCATORI PERCHÈ NON PIAGIETE I VOSTRI PECCATI CHE QVI VEDETE MORTO IL NOSTRO SIGNOR GESÙ CRISTO CHE PER VOI SALVARE FV CROCIFISSO QVALVNQVE COLLVI VORRÀ CONCORDIA PRIEGHI LA MADRE DI MISERICORDIA. XXII. E a manritta di questa porta viene una parimente antichissima pittura a fresco, ed una Figura giagantesca della Misericordia espresso in una Persona ammantata di Piviale con Mitra tonda in capo, e Stolone fino a i piedi, nella quale Stola veggonsi alcuni ovati, in cui sono effigiate le Opere della Misericordia con lettere longobarde. Questa figura sta in aria in atto maestoso di padrona, sopra a Firenze dipintale sotto col Popolo inginocchioni, e chi bramasse sapere qual fosse il secondo Cerchio della Città, o veda quivi delineato. Il Pittore di questa Tavola spiegò la sua idea con le sequenti lettere mezze gottiche, ma rifiorite sull’antiche, e dicono; OMNIS MISERICORDIA FACIET LOCVM VNICVIQVE SECVNDVM MERITVM OPERVM SVORVM, ET SEVNDVM INTELLECTVM PEREGRINATIONIS ILLIVS ANNO MCCCLII. (295) Uscendo da questo loggetta a man destra sono nel muro numero sei arpioni alti dal piano degli scalini due in tre braccia, de’quali s’ha certa tradizione, che servissero per attaccarvi la Cattedra, quando San Pier Martire predicava in su questa Piazza; della qual cosa non avendo altra autenticazione, che il detto di qualche Persona antica, mi basterà di averlo qui accennato, lasciando a ciascuno giudicare come gli piace. E sua Porta dell’Udienza, oltre l’arme de’Granduchi evvi un Cartello contenente a caratteri d’oro queste lettere: SERENISS. COSMO MAGNO D. HETRVRIAE XII. VIRI CVM CERTIS PIETATIS MINISTERIIS ET PVPRIS DERELICTIS CVM ALIQVA ECCLESIAST. DIGNIT. PERSONA. COLLIGENDIS ET CVRANDIS PRAEFECTI. XXIII. E qui mi si conceda di por fine a questa istoria, col riferire smmariamente tutti gli anni delle Pestilenze in Firenze, e suo Contado, e per conseguente i tanti prodigi di carità operati dalla Compagnia nostra in quelle stragi, e fuesti apparati di morte. La prima vi succeed nel 1325 cagionata dalla Guerra di Altopascio, la seconda nel 1340 nella quale i morti furono il sesto de i Cittadini, la maggior parte nobili; sette anni dopo seguì la terza, e nell’anno seguente 1348 venne la pestilenza chiamata la Peste grande, la quale uccise centomila anime, nel cui numero annoversari Giovanni Villani famoso Storiografo, e Matteo fratello di Giovanni ci fu tolto dalla peste del 1363 e due altre ne furono in quell’infelice secolo, cioè nel 1374 e nel 1383. Ritornò nel 1400 detta la peste de’Bianchi, che erano certe Compagnie, che andavano pellegrinando, e vi restarono quasi tutti morti; la nona fu nel 1411 e la decima venne nel 1417 con 16 mila morti. Altra di pochissima durata fuvvi nel 22 e somiglianti nel 30 e nel 37. Una poi chiamata l’Anguinata nel 1449 fu grande, massimamente nel Contado, a questa succeede nel 65 la XVI e la XVII (296) nel 79 nella quale trovatosi Marsilio Ficino, scrisse quell celebre libro intitolato: La cura della Peste, contenente ottime istruzioni. Di tre altre nel 95, 98, e 1509 non ne abbiamo particolarità: fierissima però, e lunghissima fu quella del 1525 sino al 1527 dicendone il Varchi, fece strage quasi di Uomini infiniti. Dopo questa vise la Città centotrè anni libera da tal flagella, quando nel 1630 il contagioso male scopertosi a Milano, e picchiate le Porte a Bologna, a gran passi venne a Firenze, ed in tutto il tempo del male occupatissima fu ne’suoi esercizi di Misericordia la Compagnia, che in que’tempi addimandavasi, come oggi, la Misericordia nuova, la quale si guadagnò tanta venerazione, che passando per le vie, anche terminata la peste, sentivasi rimbombare di lode l’aria. Viva viva la Compagnia della Misericordia. Non fu però questa Pestilenza l’ultima, avvegnachè nel 1633 facesse ritorno, ma dale diligenze del Granduca Ferdinando, che mise tutta la Città in quarantine, presto sparì, e per vero dire, dagli esempi posteriori non può negarsi, che la salute dell’Italia nostra non si riconosca dall’amore, potere, e diligenza de’Principi.",

        "content"  : "Translation: Jorge Gomez Historical News of the Florentine Churches: First Three Lessons of the Madonna of Orsanmichele First Lesson: There are many miraculous images of Mary in Florence, among which the most glorious was always that of Or S. Michele. This was probably due to the multiplicity of the centuries, or because of the quantity of miracles, or the quality of the honors. I would like to address all three of these privileges here in this lesson. But first, I would like to speak of his sovereign Tabernacle and the sublimity of its design and the marbles’ richness surpassing all human estimation. Moving me to do this is the lack of much valuable information left out by Francesco Bocchi, Giovanni Cinelli, and Filippo Baldinucci, who all wrote about this Oratory. Furthermore, Giorgio Vasari could have written much more about it in the life of Andrea Orcagna. However, I will begin by reporting what he briefly wrote, as follows: “Soon after having the men of the Company of Or S. Michele put together many denari of alms, and goods that were donated to that Madonna after the plague of 1348, they resolved to make around her a chapel, or Tabernacle, not only carved in marble but also from other precious stones of immense value, like mosaic and bronze, as much as could be desired. So much so that by labor and by matter every other work was advanced until the point that the grand work was made. Being the most excellent of that age, all the work was given to Orcagna. He made so many designs until one finally pleased the patrons, and they deemed it better than all the others; whereby they entrusted the work to him, they left everything to his judgment, and to his advice. He then gave several carving masters from several places all the decorative things that needed to be done and waited with his brother (Nardo di Cione) to produce all the figures of the work. When everything was finished, he had them bricked up, and made them together very considerably without mortar with spliced copper bars, so that the polished and clean marbles would not get stained, which he did so well with profit and honor, that to those that came after him and considered his work, it seems that the whole chapel of Orcagna was quarried from a single piece of marble due to its unity and joints. And although the chapel is of a Gothic manner, it holds the first place among the things of that genre and time due to its grace and proportion, and especially the composition of large and small figures, the angels, and the half-relief prophets placed so well around the Madonna. The casting of the diligently cleaned bronze enclosures is also marvelous, which, going around the whole work, encloses and squeezes it together so that it remains no less vigorous, strong, and beautiful than in all the other parts. But how much he worked to show the subtlety of his ingenuity in that great time can be seen in a large half-relief narrative in the rear part of said Tabernacle. This half-relief contains figures one and a half braccia (about 100 cm) long which depicted the twelve Apostles looking at the Madonna while surrounded in an almond tree by two angels in the sky. In one of those Apostles, he portrayed himself as old, with a shaved beard and a hood wrapped around his flat head and round face. In addition to this he wrote these words underneath in marble: “Andreas Cionis Pictor Florentinus Oratorii Archimagister exstitit bujus 1359.” Up to this point Vasari said nothing about the variety of precious marbles and the very rare stones, nothing about the many beautiful figures and statues, and nothing of the mysteries portrayed in the bas-reliefs; on the contrary, by mentioning the blessed ascended Virgin Mary, he makes a mistake by saying that the apostles look at the Madonna ascended to heaven. There are two low reliefs (not one) divided into two pictures, the first of which above shows the Ascended Virgin surrounded by Angels among some trees worked with rare finesse at the bottom of the scene. In the second section from below, which has nothing to do with the one above, we see the dead Madonna surrounded by the Apostles, and it is true that Orcagna portrayed himself, but not yet old, as the aforementioned Writer said since the good craftsman died in 1389 at age of 6o. Therefore in 1359, the year in which the Tabernacle was completed, he must have been 30 years old without any more. Here, I would like to start making up for the things of this Chapel that the writers left out. First, I would like to notice the beautiful design of this work with its measurements made by Orcagna’s own hand. Even after 400 years, the very well preserved design may be seen in the famous Library of ancient manuscripts of the former Senator Carlo Strozzi. Thanks to the courtesy of Mr. Carlo Tommaso, his worthy grandson, we have a copper engraving of the design. Now coming to the exact description, in the corner of the loggia towards the middle, the reader will see a niche adorned with various marbles, as high as a step and three braccie (about 200 cm) wide. This niche goes around the Tabernacle covered by a domed grandstand and surrounded by a rich balustrade, resting at the end of a staircase also made of marble. In the four corners of the gate worked with bronze arabesques there are four pedestals, which support a spiral column, on whose top there is a statue representing an Angel. These columns are four and three-quarter braaccie high, and the Angels are one and one fourth. Then after this noble balustrade, inside rises the much-commended Tabernacle supported by four pillars, each of which has nine columns that are three and a sixth braccie high, and a quarter large, between each of them you can see hard stones shining with an abundance of lapis lazuli – not only in the pillars, but in the bases and in the arches of the Dome, as well. Twelve are of the Prophets, which are one braccia high, and half turned on the architrave, each having a sign that expresses the virtues of the Virgin Mary. Then there are four spiers made in the Gothic style, six and an eighth braccie high without the base, which in the middle they place the dome six and a quarter high, and in the highest of it is an Angel two braccie tall. The vague arabesques and the very fine marble leaves are extended everywhere in such a manner that they are considered miraculous. Finally, eight mysteries are represented in the base of the grandstand in graceful bas-reliefs. These are of the Nativity of Mary, her Presentation in the Temple, the Marriage with Saint Joseph, the Annunciation, the Epiphany, the Circumcision, and in the eighth, according to the ancient tradition, an Angel who brings to the Virgin a palm leaf as an announcement of Christ’s death. In the middle of such a remarkable grandstand above the rich altar surrounded by beautiful relief angels there is a painting, famous and adored all around the world, of the image of the Virgin Mary, called the Madonna of Or S. Michele, the most powerful advocate of the Florentines. Giulio Mancini, a modern Tuscan author, argues in one of his essays about paintings that this image was painted by the Sienese painter, Ugolino di Nerio. I will report here a scholarly defense from Baldinucci written during the life of Orcagana. It states as follows: “We will add lastly that the modern writer, of whom we spoke a little while ago, believed that Vasari made a mistake to have affirmed that the sacred image of the Virgin Mary, which adorned this Tabernacle, was made by the hand of Ugolino who died in 1349, being that the image was painted in 1284. It did not seem likely to him that in 1284 Ugolino could have been well educated in painting and that he could have painted such a work. Furthermore, the style of the painting was more akin to a Byzantine painting than to a contemporary Florentine one. Finally, the image is wooden, and Vasari says that the image that originally hung on the column in the loggia was made by Ugolino. But if we consider well, the Author’s argument cannot hold. First, Vasari in his first edition says that Ugolino died not in 1349 but in 1339, and in both the first and second editions he states that Ugolino died in a decrepit age. Therefore, if we count well, in 1284 he could have been at least 30 or 35 years old, and consequently in the prime of his work. Secondly, Vasari says in both editions and in open letters that Ugolino worked in a Byzantine style and that he always stubbornly kept to these ancient ways, even though many painters of his time - including Giotto himself – worked in a much better manner. For this reason, we must say that the painting is the hand of Ugolino. That she may be on wood or on the wall may then be typo by the printer. Instead of writing “he made the image of our Lady FOR a pillar of the loggia” he wrote “IN a pillar”. And even when Vasari had said so, we still find that he and many of those who wrote about the lives of painters, used to say that a painting was made in a church, but it is not necessarily made for said church. Thus, Vasari having said this, Ugolino making Our Woman in the pillar does not prevent us from being able to believe that he meant that Ugolino had made the image into a wooden painting to get the measurements right and then for that panel to be placed on the pillar. The doubt then seems to be reduced to a mere cavillation. Having accomplished this and having the obligation to trace all the most noteworthy things in this chapel, I will go on to discuss the singular privileges of the Most Holy Image. I must observe that ascribing to the painting its performance of sensational miracles to the year 1292 – despite being the one noted by Giovanni Villani – is incorrect. I find that the distinguished Company of the Madonna of Or. S. Michele had begun in 1291, which would presuppose that before some time the miraculous painting was already in great place on the pillar. Therefore, it seems more likely that the holy painting was placed on the pillar soon after 1284, the year the loggia was built. Hence it is now about 460 years old, counting only from 1291, the start of the company. And here I would like to make a not contemptuous reflection on a marvelous combination of two sanctuaries which were formed at the same time and became famous all over the world. For precisely at this time, when in our image, heaven opened a source in Florence or rather a river of grace, the angels brought the House of Nazareth from Palestine to Italy. And if Pontiffs, Emperors, Kings, and Princes made the Lauretan temple magnificent, the Florentine Republic alone, as we shall see later, not wanting to spend immense treasures, built the Madonna of Or. S. Michele, one of the most splendid and superb churches. As the Book of the Reformations stated “Un fiat Beatissime Virgini Marie S. Michaelis in Orto templum splendidissimum, &amp;amp; supra modum splendidissimum”. Pilgrims came to the Holy House of Loreto from all parts of the world, and even people from different parts of Europe came with very large offerings and vows to venerate our Image, thus writing to Pope Urban V in 1364 “Ad quod sere concurrunt homines de variis Mundi partibus”. And after such a beautiful digression, returning to our Image, I must not forget to mention things about the Company of Or. S. Michele, like the most authoritative document demonstrating the antiquity of the miraculous painting. There is no better way of doing this than by summarily reporting the old chapters of the statutes written in the fourteenth century, and communicated to me by the scholar and courteous Mr. Domenico Maria Manni, the prologue of which is as follows: “In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. And to the honor and reverence of Our Lord Jesus Christ, and of His Most Holy Mother Madonna Santa Maria always Virgin, and of Blessed Santo Michele Arcangelo, &amp;amp; of Blessed Santo Lorenzo, and of the whole Court of Heaven, and to the honor and reverence of the Holy Church of Rome, &amp;amp; of Our Lord the Pope, and of his Cardinal Signori Friars, and of the Bishop of Florence, and to the status, honor, and maintenance of the City of Florence, and its district, for the good and consolation of the Poor. These are the Chapters, and the orders of those, which are and will be of the said Company, which was begun in the years of the Incarnation of Our Lord Jesus Christ, MCCLXXXI. the day of Blessed Santo Lorenzo in the month of August.” Three writers penned forty chapters in the confraternity’s statutes that confirm the high veneration that different peoples had for this institution. In the first one we must recall the manner which was used to console the hordes of peoples who asked to be enrolled in the company. This confraternity employed a notary obligated to solemnly stand at the desk every day to register the names of the brothers and sisters who were enrolling. However, since there were too many to accommodate, the step was taken to have foreigners and those from the countryside registered alongside citizens as soon as they entered through the city’s gates. And with a rare example we find in chapter XXXVII that even the dead were ascribed to the company as long as one brought the name of the deceased to the notary. As written in the book, his soul became a participant in the suffrages of which grace was given. The policy was marked with the confraternity’s seal of the Annunciation and with these words written around it: Sigillum Societatis Virg. Marie Sancti Mich. in orto de Florentia. I will discuss everything that the company did under the Loggia in the second chapter, but here I will instead talk about the sacred pillar, since in those early times of the statute’s creation the Oratory was not mentioned. In every evening, lauds were sung by the Laudesi brothers. During the eve of the feasts of the Lord, of Mary, of the Apostles, and of the Holy Advocates of the City, these lauds were sung with greater solemnity, making a general illumination of the whole Loggia in the preceding night. On all Sundays of the year and other solemn days, a sermon was delivered in the Loggia by preachers chosen by the Clergy to preach in the late afternoon hours, after Vespers. Throughout the day, four assiduous guards were kept at the pillar and then two at night to receive offerings of wax, clothing, money, and alms, which were more abundant since they were made at night. Finally, in the third chapter it is pertinent to talk about the examples of charity and piety that the brothers gave to the city and to the county. Most devout in the Company were the processions of the Carmine and the Nonziata, which each year visited two of the following churches: S. Marco, S. Spirito, S. Croce, and S. Maria Novella. The order would restart every three years with the offering of a one-ounce candle for each brother. Each Monday six masses were celebrated in various churches for the deceased brothers. This was done so that each dead brother would have at least one mass said for him during the year, in which an officer of the company had to attend and pay twelve coins to the Priest. However, the most common gifts were general alms, besides the daily ones, and which took place in all the districts of Florence and its county. Indeed, it was the happiest day of the whole year for the poor, among which were included all the monasteries, hospitals, prisons, and hermits, being found in the books of the company, as charitable donations sometimes reached the sum of 37,000 lire, which helped the fame of Or. S. Michele and its company grow. And, as I have done in the book’s other chapters, allow me to quote the title which can be read at the beginning of another book, called Green Champion, as follows: “Codex bonorum piissima Societatis Gloriosissime Virg. Maria S. Michaelis in Orto, merito in toto Orbe re &amp;amp; fama memoratissima, ob suum devotissimum Oratorium sub famoso Templo , ac supramodnm Eminentissimo, eius nomine fundatum pariter &amp;amp; sonstrutum.” By having invoked the miraculous image of the Madonna of Orsanmichele, located on the pillar in the loggia, we may now refer to the multiple miracles it performed with so much abundance. Giovanni Villani interrupted the flow of his chronicle with the story of the painting’s amazing powers, writing: “On the 3rd of July 1292, great and open miracles began to be shown in the city of Florence for a figure of S. Maria painted in one of the loggia’s pillars of Or. S. Michele, where wheat is sold, the sick are healed, people are captivated, and miracles were performed in large quantities.” S. Antonio affirms the same in the third part of his story, as follows: “Eodem anno (1292.) mense Iulii patrata sunt quadam miracula Florentia ex quadam Figura Virginis Gloriosa, qua erat in pariete picta atrii, seu horti S. Michaelis, ubi tunc forum erat frument, &amp;amp; aliorum bladorum. Nam concepta devotione ab omnibus ad Figuram illam infirmis devote orantibus, plures sanati sunt exvariis languoribus, claudi erecti, contracti sanati, &amp;amp; obsessi a doemonibus liberati.” In the same year (1292), the image of the Glorious Virgin that appears on the wall of the court of Orsanmichele, the market for corn and grain, performed a miracle in the month of July. Answering the devout prayers of the people, the sick were healed, the lame walked, and those possessed by demons were freed.] Sozomeno from Pistoia wrote about this in his general history of the world, which is preserved in the library of the regular canons of the abbey of Fiesole. As Father Antonio Zaccaria writes about the aforementioned story: “Anno 1292. Die 3. Mensis Iulii Figura picta B. Virginis Maria, qua erat in horto S. Michaelis fecit multa miracula sanando infirmos &amp;amp; elaudos, unde fuit maxima devotio totius populi &amp;amp; finitimorum, &amp;amp; tantum aucta est, quod singulis annis distribuebantur sex mille libbra, &amp;amp; usque ad hodiernum diem extat devotion” “In the year 1292. On the 3rd day of July the figure of the Blessed Virgin Mary, located in the garden of Orsanmichele, performed many miracles by healing the sick and the lame, and it is venerated to this day” All the Tuscan writers speak of it this way, but none that I know of tell of how this miraculous painting was saved by Sig. Neri Abati in 1304 and thus was unharmed by the fire in Florence of that year, which burned not only the adjoining houses, but the loggia itself. Additional miracles that the painting performed can be observed in Orsanmichele’s stained glass windows, which some believe were the first to be made in the city after the secret was brought to Florence from Flanders. The quantity and quality of the miracles performed by the Madonna of Orsanmichele provoked responses that I must report. The first derived from theologians and professors of divinity, who were not convinced of the powers of the painting or swayed by the stories they were told – but who were probably simply jealous of the devotion it received. They urged people to reconsider its power, which caused the Masters of Theology to be accused of envy over the pure zeal they were showing to the glory of God and Mary. St. Antonino (Bishop of Florence, 1446-1459) wrote about it in the third part of his story, scathingly rejecting the accounts of Giovanni Villani and of other writers. Antonino’s words are as follows: “Fratres’ autem Predicatores &amp;amp; Minores, quia parum fidei dabant dictis miraculis, Populus, qui leviter movetur, eis detrahebat, &amp;amp; obloquebatur contra eos, adscribens invidia, quod erat vera pietatis” “Because the Friars’ Preachers and Minors (Dominicans and Franciscans) properly gave little credence to the miracles which had been reported, the people (who were unpersuaded by them) drew away from the clerics and insulted them by claiming their protests were driven by envy.” But the stupendous abundance of miracles contradicted the aforesaid critique. At all hours the painting attracted the impoverished and the sick, along with curious strangers who wished to witness supernatural events, and their prayers of thanks filled the air with a thousand blessings. So it was then that the Loggia, intended for the sale of grain, was instead frequently encumbered by the crowd of devotees, so much so that the Signoria was forced to close the loggia – but I am not sure of the year. It was then transformed into a church, but not without serious regret and opposition from several citizens of the Great Council, who lamented the alternations that compromised the beauty of the most majestic place in Florence, which we will describe in due course. The very large sums that were donated to the guardians of the pillar were the direct result of the many miracles performed there. I will now report on only one of these many rich offerings. It was the one that the Florentines made in 1348 (the year of the great plague) recorded in the ledgers kept by the captains of Or. S. Michele, which ascended to a sum of 35,000 gold florins that, as Matteo Villani reported, was an incredible treasure due to the value of the money then. This was an offering so large that none like it had ever been made to another sanctuary of its time. But since we have recalled the merits of this image’s antiquity and miracles, reason has it that we speak of the honors received both publicly and in private. To avoid recounting the long series of ordinations made by the Republic regarding the cult of our Lady, I have chosen some of the most memorable ones, which are high marks of honor to this Oratory, and will discuss other solicitudes of the Signoria in another lesson in order to place the Loggia alongside the most commendable works of Architecture, Sculpture, and Painting. The act that increased the devotion of the painting, along with the holy tabernacle, occurred when she was declared by the republic as a special advocate of the Florentines: the sound of the great bell, customarily rung to recognize grave resolutions, summoned people to the great Piazza dei Signori on the 13th of August 1365. A law was passed in 1366, soon after this proclamation, ordering every citizen to send a banner to Or. S. Michele and if he was a soldier, one light shield (“targa”). To this same end, governed by piety and following another law of 1386, the Churches’ Rectors and the Superiors of the Holiday of Ascension were expected to make an offering at the Altar, which on the same solemn day the Gonfalonier offered a gift of fruit at mid mass, serving as an example to all. Ever increasing the ardor of everyone to do new honors to Mary, he then gave votive offerings of wax figures portrayed naturally, being as tall as the living, with heads and hands, with hats, dresses, shapes, and every other ornament. As per the custom of those times, the Loggia was so filled that it was, as the proverb states, “Sarebbon’elleno mai tante quanti I Boti di Or. S. Michele” - There are more votives in Orsanmichele than there are Hellenes in Greece – to which S. Antonino add, “&amp;amp; in processi temporis est repletes locus imaginibus cereis” (And as time went by, the room was filled with wax figures). Returning to the holy laws of the republic regarding the veneration and esteem of this valuable image, we must not ignore the one which required the men of the government to swear on the venerable altar of Or. S. Michele to directly administer public matters and attest the books of Remembrances (Recordanze) of those times. Each member made their public or private oaths solemnly, taking it for granted that severe punishments would be meted out to those with insincere intentions. An ancient statute can be found in Rubrica115 of book II which states that any oaths made beyond this altar would be declared null: Nullo modo valeat, neque observetur, nisi tale iuramentum praestitum fuerit coram B. Virgine, &amp;amp; Capitaeneis Or. S. Michaelis (In no way shall it be valid, nor observed, unless such an oath has been made before the Blessed Virgin and the Captains of Ortus S. Michael). And from a book of the Company of Or. S. Michele we have the following privilege: “1329, the Florentine Republic orders that whoever has killed any of his relatives, from whom the delinquent could have inherited from, he shall be stripped of this inheritance. A third of this inheritance will then go to the company of the Virgin Mary of Or. S. Michele, and the remainder to the Municipality of Florence”. It was thought by the lords that the value of Or. S. Michele would increase by hosting exquisite concerts and a concourse for lauds which were said to be at the oratory every evening. The republic thus ordered in the law of 1388 that the musicians of the city, and the Sonatori di pifferi, and Viole players of the Palace, should come to Or. S. Michele on Saturdays and on solemn feasts, a custom which is still preserved today. And here I may be granted, although outside its place, to discuss two additional alms made by the Company of Or. S. Michele which can give light to the Florentine history and which I did not know about when I wrote about the chapters of the company above. I learned about these from Mr. Domenic Maria Manni, who found them in the same books: “1306, alms of 100 florins donated by Giovanna Romita da Signa and delivered by Chele Lapi, a Laudese singer from San Frediano”. This is the same one from Signa who was beatified, and on page 49 of the book it says that the gift was for general maintenance or discretionary use. In the book of 1307, there is another alm from a resident of Fosse della Porta dell’Alloro Oste, Giotto di Bondone, the distinguished painter who restored the art to its glory. And finally in praise of this Oratory, I will report some verses from the famous Fra Domenico from Coiella, a writer of the fifteenth century, no less famous for his theological works than for his poetic art, as noted by the scholarly author of the Delights of the Erudites in his tome of 1742, to whom we are able to give the print of the IV book of Elegies on Florentine churches to the aforementioned Author, where he says as follows: Attamen apparet longe spatiosior intus, Fulget ubi Sancta Matris imago Dei. Hans miro candore nitens complectitur arcus, Sculptilibus pollens undique marmoreis Quorum compages tanta contexitur arte, Ut fibi vix aliud par videatur opus (However, the interior appears far more spacious; It shines when the image of the Holy Mother of God shines. Hans embraces a gleaming rainbow The powerful marble statues on all sides Their structure is so tightly consolidated Hardly another pair of work to be seen) Second Lesson: The motives of great patrons to construct magnificent buildings made is to demonstrate their might and wealth. At the same time it is the solicitous commitment to increase their city’s ornamentation and to contribute to the needs of its citizens. Such were the ends that the Florentine Republic had in mind when building the majestic and most splendid building of Or. S. Michele. It was the Florentines who had risen to great power by means of commerce and thus wanted to reveal to the whole world the splendor of their free state, and to give to its potentates a structure made even worthier by the many artistic riches installed inside it. One of the main ornaments of Florence, this marvelous building had already been used for the preservation of grains and for the custody of the General Archive’s public faith. Nor should I overlook another nobler reason for its construction, derived from Florentine piety: the miraculous Tabernacle of the Madonna di Or. S. Michele. The Lords wanted the temple’s marvels of architecture and sculpture to complement each other, as we will see in this lesson. Since the original has been lost, I quote from an imperfect copy of the Captain’s Statutes that appears in Chapter X of the Green Book of Or. S. Michele, in which we read of the ordination made by the republic for the above-mentioned purpose: “Templum in statura &amp;amp; forma Palatii cum volta supra coopriente Oratorium, &amp;amp; alia deinceps , &amp;amp; tesso , atquesor platea, ubi consueverat esse sorum denominatum Orto di S. Michele, cui erant confines a 1 &amp;amp; 2 via, a 3 Illorum de domo de Abbatibus, &amp;amp; 4 de domo Caligariis, &amp;amp; cuius constructio fuit commissa per Consilium Civitatis Arti Porta S. Maria, &amp;amp; suit ordinatum, quod fierent 12. Pilastra laterum, &amp;amp; in unoquoque ponendum fore statuam S. Advocati cuiusque Artis, &amp;amp; in medio lateris dignioris Figura Advocati Partis Guelforum, cioe S. Ludovici, ut sic B. Virgo Maria defenderet &amp;amp; augeret Artes &amp;amp; Universitates buius Civitatis, ut apparet mentio de pradictis facts per Reformationem editam manu Ser Folchi Ser Antonii Notarii Populi &amp;amp; Com. Flor an. 1309 De mense Aprilis.” Meaning: The temple in stature and form of a palace with a vault above the oratory, and another successively, and tesso, and the street, where it had customarily been called Orto di S. Michele, whose first and second borders were on the road, the third side across from the house of their abbots, and the fourth from the house of the Caligaries. Its construction was entrusted by the Council of the Silk Guild, and it was arranged that twelve piers should hold the saintly advocates of the guilds, along with the patron saint of the Guelph party – S. Louis – so that B. Virgo Maria could defend and enhance the guilds and institutions of the State, as appears in the contract written by Ser Folchi Ser Antonio, Notary Public &amp;amp; Com. Flor, in the year 1309, the month of April. Therefore, we have from such an authoritative Book with the public Decree of the new construction delegated to the Silk guild, called the Por. S. Maria, for the fortunate and grandiose initiation of the foundation, or rather of the designs for, this building, in the year 1309. Taddeo Gaddi, the public’s architect of the time, had to do the design, but the pillars were not installed until 1337. The delay was caused by the Emperor Henry VII’s siege of Florence. He was the enemy of the Florentines his whole life since the war with the Pisans and Lucchesi and internal discord, but calm returned to the city on July 29 of the aforementioned year. The first stone was placed by Gonfaloniere Strozza, attended by the Signoria, and all the magistrates. Then followed all the people with the blessing of the Florentine Bishop Francesco Silvestri from Cingoli. Giovanni Villani spoke of this solemn function in book XI of his Chronicles, in chapter 66. To not repeat the things I said above, I will rather report some circumstance noted by Leopold del Migliore, on page 540, as follows: “The ceremony which was performed in the name of the Guelphs who dominated the city, never reduced to such a happy state as it is now. It was marked by the throwing of gold and silver coins, minted on one side with the building and these letters: Ut magnificentia Pouli Flor Artis, &amp;amp; Artificum ostendatur. On the other were the arms of the republic and we can read Reip. &amp;amp; Popili Honor &amp;amp; Decus” Those who were by chance there and told about it added more details, such as the fact that the Ambassador of the city of Arezzo threw a small coin onto the pile. How many years later the place reached its current state of sublime perfection is not possible to determine; although there are some paintings by Jacopo del Casentino, Lorenzo di Credi, and Andrea del Sarto, and Giovanni Antonio Sogliani. Luca della Robbia produced three of the tondi, and between them appear many statues that were produced in the fifteenth century by Donatello and his workshop that were done with innovation, noble design, and beauty. You many also wonder who the architect was, since in a folder in the church Leopold del Migliore praises Andrea Orcagna and Baldinucci gives credit to Taddeo Gaddi as the architect. However, I believe that they are correct in part, and we will see this once we distinguish the length of time it took to complete the project. First, in 1284, Arnolfo built the Loggia by order of the Signoria. Second, in 1337 Taddeo Gaddi installed the pillars which were first made of bricks, and then covered up with stone and marble. Gaddi then died in 1350. In 1352, according to Baldinucci, Orcagna worked on the altar of the Madonna until 1359, at which time he became the architect. As for the expense, Varchi writes that it reached eighty-six thousand gold florins, an enormous amount considering the currency’s value in those times. Twenty thousand florins were diverted from the grain Loggia for the use of the church, as mentioned above. I found in the books of Commissions in the years 1339 and 1350, assigned to Silk Art, that this money was obtained without aggravating the municipality with a new tax, but that certain levies were created called the seven Piazzas from the Mallevadoria dell’Armi. Villani call it a small duty, as if by this diminutive term he meant how the little amount assigned to be collected was multiplied for the good of commerce that such an excellent amount could have been raised. However, I would like to recall an incredible entry which can be found in the book called Campione on page 14, and also noted by Villani in book XI, chapter 91. This entry notes that 750 florins of gold were obtained every year merely by sweeping up coins that were left there like trash. Still, we should note here the stupendous contributions made by devotees to the miraculous image, a portion of which was given to the magnificent ornamentation of this solemn and very rich temple. This praise will truly prove to be appropriate for Or. S. Michele, and much greater still for what we will say to describe its qualities. Its shape is almost quadrangular, being 42 braccie long, 32 wide, and 80 tall. It is all encrusted with strong squared stone which is water resistant and season-proof.According to Vasari, all gothic style buildings made in Tuscany at the time were walled up, and this Barbarian Architectural can be seen in this tower. However, in it we see one of the first improvements of the art, which was done to reinvigorate it. We can observe the arches which are turned into a portion of a circle and above the main pillars of the vault there are two series of large adorned windows in the compartments formed by marble columns. In the triangles of the front we can see the coat of arms of the Republic, the Guelph Party, and the royal house of Naples which is a shield divided in half with lilies on one side, and flat listre on the other. This was done for the Kingdom of Hungary, which was under the rule of Louis Anjou, son of Charles, when the loggia was built. He was such a friend and protector of the Florentines and Guelphs that as a sign of gratitude they raised there his coat of arms. At the time, this was the greatest benevolence that Florence ever professed towards a monarch. The place was finished with a wreath of openwork roses, which was supported by corbels that swing outward and gracefully turn around you like a parapet. The ground runs around a stone foundation a little higher than four braccie up to the niches, in which appear statues of the patron saints of the guilds. Some of these larger than lifesize figures were made of metal and others of marble, but all were beautifully carved. They spared no expense to outdo the work of previous masters. A comment in a book marked “F” reads as follows: “Knowing how important it is to give heart to those who work hard to bring about ideas, try to leave his most honored name and fame to his homeland through rare workmanship. It is desired that those who have already been elected to show off their talent, and to know about the Statues of Or. S. Michele, be amply rewarded.” To give an account of these statues starting from the eastern side to the via dei Calzaioli, in the first niche there was St. Luke, then St. Thomas, followed by St. John the Baptist. Towards the middle, the first niche holds St. John the Evangelist, St. George is in the second, St. James is in the third, and St. Mark the fourth. On the side of the magistrate, St. Lo was on the first pillar, then St. Stephen and third St. Matthew. Turning to Tramontana, the first niche is vacant for a certain reason of which we speak later; the second spot contains the Quattro Coronati, followed by St. Philip and then St. Peter. Coming back to St. Luke, this statue was made by Giambologna for the guild of the Judges and Notaries, also known as the Proconsolo, whose coat of arms is a star of gold, which fills the whole field with silver carved in the corners of the base. St. Thomas was made by Andrea del Verrocchio, disciple of Donatello. The saint seems so alive that it appears to be led by love to touch the wound of Christ. It was done at the expense of Mercanzia, which has a red star on a white bale as an insignia. By virtue of a public decree, St. Louis should be placed in this niche but we do not know why he was withdrawn from the niche save for matters of style. I read in the Green Champion, ordered in 1483, that Andrea was satisfied with this workmanship and placed its value at up to 800 large florins. St. John the Baptist belongs to the Merchants’ Guild, formerly the Consuls of the Calimala, whose symbol is a golden eagle on a white bale in a red field. The workmanship is by Ghiberti, whose name is written to the hem of the suit. However, we must confess that this is a languid figure in comparison to his other marvelous works. St. John the Evangelist, made of bronze, is the work of Baccio da Montelupo who made it with great diligence for the Silk guild, for whom the symbol is a red door on a silver field. Next is St. George, whose first location was in Tramontana, very proportionate to his greatness. We will later talk about the reason for his moving. The armorers and swordsmen, who make metal jackets and rapiers for weapons, had it done. This figure is esteemed by all as the most beautiful. In addition to what Vasari says about it, Bocchi has made a treatise titled “The Excellence of the Statue of St. Giorgio made by Donatello,” which was printed in 1584 by Marescotti. Nearby is the statue of St. James of the guild of the Furriers, who have on their coat of arms a white sheep on a field of blue. This saint was done by Nanni di Antonio del Bianco and is very much liked. St. Mark is by Donatello, of which Michelangelo said: “That if such was the semblant of the living Saint, he could be believed in everything he has written, as much shows the statue of an honest man. Nanni made St. Louis for the Farrier’s guild, as evidenced by their coat of arms, which is a pair of black pincers. Admirable is the St. Stephen, a worthy work of Ghiberti, as a reward of which he also had the grace to make St. Matthew which is for the Wool Guild, having a white sheep with a white banderola and a red cross on a blue field as the coat of arms; there is also that of the Bankers guild, whose symbol was a red field sown with gold coins. In the archive of said guild there is a book in which, in addition to reading the allocation of the statue to Ghiberti, you can find how the officers of the guild obtained the niche, which had previously been given to the guild of the bakers to place their protector, St. Lawrence. However, being that the statue was poor valueless art, on the 24th of June in 1419 the Signoria, led by Gonfaloniere Niccolò di Franco Sacchetti – with the consent of the bakers – gave their place to the bankers to make the figure of St. Matthew, for which Lorenzo Ghiberti received 650 gold florins. Two marble statuettes, worked with honor by Niccolò Aretino, can also be observed in this place. After this comes the empty niche, where nothing remains except a base with a prodigious half-relief by Donatello representing St. George who kills the Dragon, praised by Raffaello Borghini with these words “one can look at it, but not imitate it.” The Quattro Coronati are by Nanni, representing four different Masters of the arts with the ax, the shoe, the ladle, and other blacksmith tools. The artist was troubled with their positioning in such a narrow place. However, his master Donatello, with the reward of only a dinner, with a few industrious blows, arranged them in a way to cover the disciple’s error, which got him esteem and wonder from all. Next is St. Philip, made by Nanni for the guild of the shoemakers. St. Peter was for the Guild of the Butchers, intelligently made by Donatello. Vasari holds it to be an admirable and extremely rare work due to the graceful drapery corresponding to the altitude of the body, so that the clothes are not better worn on a living man. Such a litany of statues, united this way and exhibited to the public, is seen in very few cities. Many have come from distant places to see them, confessing that it seems to them a rare thing indeed. To defend these statues and uphold the respect demanded by the Florentines, we have the statute which imposes punishment on anyone who throws stones at them or does some harm to them. We can find another beautiful view in the archways between pillars, adorned with four tall columns, on each of which is a statue one and a half braccie tall. In all they are forty, decorated with rustic acanthus leaves, as the arabesques that fill the arches are very vague. The last things to be seen above the niches are paintings in the twelve terracotta tondi, all but three of which are ruined, by Luca della Robbia. They depict a Madonna with a child on her neck above the pillar of St. George, the army of the Republic above St. Thomas, and the symbol of the guild of Por Santa Maria above St. John. Now it remains to discuss the aforementioned translation of the Madonna from the guild of the Doctors and Apothecaries that one can now see at S. Giorgio. However, having to assemble in another lesson on the many shining virtues from the interior of the Temple, in which we will talk again about the story of this decorative program, we will here return to praise this wonderful construction, some verses from the famous Dominican poet: “Nunc ubi magna domus pracelsa turris ad instar Fertur in aereas altius una plagas • Qua licet ex omni videatur splendida parte Sanctorum Statuas dum soris ipsa tenet. Attamen apparet longe speciosor intus Fulget ubi Sancta Matris Imago Dei.” Meaning: Now where the great house towers, said to be in bronze, one of the higher quarters From which one may be seen on every side the splendid statues of the saints while she holds the statues of sori. However, it appears far more beautiful inside where the image of the Holy Mother of God shines. Third Lesson: It is impossible to discuss the church interior in an orderly manner without considering the prodigious altar of the Madonna of Or. S. Michele, already described in the first lesson. I must add to the aforementioned discussion a comment on the laudable uses made from the great riches it has generated for the republic, and the daily sacred rites the altar services. To start with the first one, I will note a document indicating the great treasures spent in pious works by the superiors of the Oratory. Thanks to the captains, in addition to the splendid and noble maintenance of the church, they were able to administer large sums of money for the workings of the Monasteries of Chiarito, Lapo, and San Giorgio. Today they are considered exemplary monasteries in Florence, and their establishment is noted in the writings of Ser Michele di Ghirolfo da Lucardo in 1342 and Ser Salvestro Salvestri in 1405 in the general archive. About the second point, I would like to refer to the institution formed by the republic in 1415, composed of a collegiate of ten Priests and two cherici with a head called “Proposto” (Superintendent). Its establishment can be found a book with wooden covers in the archives of the captains. It can be read there that up until that time, the Oratory had been used by a single priest with the title of Sacristan. With the intervention of the musicians, they assist with the performance of the usual lauds to Mary on the holidays, and on every Saturday at the unveiling of the sacred Image with the singing of the litany, at which time 26 candles burn, with 12 at the altar, 6 at the tendrils, and eight at the garland. By legacy of Luca di Filippo Carnesecchi Gentiluomo Fiorentino, two candles must always be lit for the Mass at the Consecration. In his Testament of 1601, drawn up by Ser Antonio di Ser Chello, he says “I leave two doublets of yellow wax of 15 pounds to be perpetually lit to the Madonna of Or S. Michele at the time of the elevation of the host.” Passing now to recall how many sacred and beautiful things were in this Oratory, I will say that leaning against the pillar, next to this chapel, there is a larger than life-size wood crucifix, carved in a primitive style that the Florentines venerate. Based on the authority of the writers of Holy Archbishop Antoninus’s life, it was believed that it was customary for him to go there to pray when he was a child; so he was painted at the foot of the cross, at that age. However, we can’t confirm without an authoritative document whether the Crucifix of dried Elm actually spoke to the Saint (Antoninus). However, I believe Rondinelli’s report of the plague, in which he wrote: “The Friars of St. Mark went in procession on many Fridays to the Crucifix of Or. S. Michele to which St. Antonino went to pray as a boy.” I must thank those Benefactors, who in the year 1714 made for this divine image a richly carved tabernacle with a gilded canopy, pavonazzi pendants, and gold fringes. Opposite in the second pillar, you can see a fresco figure of The Good Thief, which was rarely painted in those days: the painter not only nailed him to the cross, but tied his legs with ropes so that he would not be confused with Christ Jesus. This is the customary way the Church made it, as Molano noted. I will now talk about the reason this painting was placed here. For 300 years the painting was noted in the Books of the Compagnia della Croce al Tempio, and copied by Vincenzio del Corno Gentiluomo Fiorentino – lover of old things - in his memoirs, and read about in Leopoldo del Migliore’s book as follows “1361 N. N. condemned to the gallows, he was from a family more than moderately civil. A few hours before he was taken to the fields, he spoke to a brother of the company of the Neri who was used to assisting those about to suffer publicly. He told him he had a sum of money in a chest at his house at the foot of the Ponte Vecchio. His intention was to have a figure of the Good Thief painted in Or. S. Michele at the pillar near the oratory so that one could pray to God that in that last short breath, so that he would use the mercy to bless him. Whoever fulfilled this legacy wrote this memoir.” This image was painted by Iacopo Landini from Prato Vecchio, known as the Casentino (Jacopo del Casentino). We will now mention about the other paintings in that space, almost all of which were his. The vault indeed is by Jacopo, where he represented sixteen Patriarchs and Prophets who pose on a field of ultramarine blue, a color that cost a lot since it has to be extracted from the precious lapis lazuli stones. There were many state citizens who murmured about it saying it was a waste of the Madonna of Orsanmichele’s money. However, this bold talk displeased the people so much that, according to Cambi, they wanted the imprisonment of one member of the Foraboschi house to satisfy the outrage of Mary. Returning to Jacopo del Casentino, likewise he painted the many saints that appear above the other in the arches. On a second ovate St. Mary Magdalene is carried to heaven by the angels, the latter painted by the hand of Andrea del Sarto. St. Stephen, painted between the two doors, was made by Poppi, who again made the two paintings, that are in the choir, of Christ and St. John the Baptist. The St. Martin in front of St. Stephen is believed to be of the Sogliani. The St. Augustine in the middle of the choir is also believed to be his although there are those who say it was done by Albertinelli. On the wall under the organ, Agnolo Gaddi represented Christ Disputing among the Doctors. And let’s not neglect to report what Doctor Brocchi recalls having happened to the figure of St. Verdiana, who is seen at the pillar of the corner of this church next to the image of St. Lucy. This image particularly flourished in our times, but to the great detriment of history the painter erased the inscription written in gothic characters underneath. Stranger still, the Saint can now be seen in secular clothing, whereas normally she was shown wearing a religious habit. The important chapel of St. Anne was erected by of the Municipality of Tramontana, which was dedicated to commemorate the most important action that could happen in a free republic, the expulsion of the Tyrant Duke of Athens and violent occupier of the Florentine Domain. This occurred on July 26, 1343 the feast of St. Anne’s, who became honored for her assistance as one of the patron saints of the city, receiving the title Propitia &amp;amp; F. utrix libertatis Civitatis Florentina, “the woman of liberty of the state of Florence.” In the Book of Riformagioni Lib. B. of 1349, appears a record of how the Signoria decreed to spend three thousand florins of gold for the erection of a new chapel in Or. S. Michele. This chapel was then demolished in 1526 by the captains so that the altar could receive on top of it the larger-than-life white marble figure of the Virgin Mary Carrying the Infant Jesus in her womb, a highly praised work by Francesco da San Gallo. On the 26th of July, the Signoria annually took part in a ritual offering with the Captains of the guilds. There was on that day a horse race, among other things of great joy, ordered in the Statutes of the 28 of October 1343 with this beautiful introduction of words: “Pro honore Reip. &amp;amp; ad perpetuam memomoriam libertatis Civitatis Florentia, &amp;amp; ut Civium mentibus sit infixum, qualiter die S. Anna de mense Iulii Populus Flor per Dei gratiam, &amp;amp; virtutem bonorum, a Tyrannide Ducis Atbernarum liberatus.” Meaning: “In honor of the Commonwealth and to the perpetual remembrance of the liberty of the state of Florence, and so that it may be fixed in the minds of the citizens, how on the day of St. Anna, in the month of July, the people of Flor, by the grace of God and the virtue of good men, were freed from the tyranny of the duke of Athens.” And in a panel of the church we read that on this feast day is exhibited the relic of the saint, which is kissed by the Friars of the Centuria and the Nuns of SS. Trinità. I will now speak about another chapel and refer back to what I promised in the preceding lesson. A Madonna seated with her son made by Simone da Fiesole, pupil of Brunelleschi, was placed at the niche of the Apothecaries. It was then transferred to the church where it was placed at one of the two large doors to form a chapel. The reason for this was that in 1628, many people swore to have seen this statue blink and move, which then caused a panic. They all ran away in very large numbers, forming crowds during the day and night to the point that the streets had to be blocked to escape the tumult. Everyone was shouting for mercy, which was one of the preludes to the plague which came to Florence in 1630. To divert the devout people, who refused leave there, Grand Duke Ferdinand resolved to transfer it inside. This miraculous event was processed by the order of Archbishop Alessandro Marzimedici and the Canon Cavaliere Giovanni Guidacci, one of the people who claimed to have seen the statue blink several times. During the time of the Republic, another similar case occurred (in 1493) with the image of the Madonna, which was standing outside of its niche. In this case an uncoverted Jew, on a fine day when he thought he couldn’t be seen, struck the statue with an iron rood, a crime for which he was killed. This incident can be read today at the foot of the marble, and the sacrilege also appears in the Chronicle by Forese da Ribatta, who goes into more detail saying that his body was thrown into St. Stephen’s sewer as a final contempt. The words carved into the marble base in the memory of this fact are the following: “Hanc ferro effigiem petiit ludeus, &amp;amp; Index Ipse fibi vulgo dilaniatus obit MccccLxxXXlII.” Knowing that the title of Or. S. Michele is frequently mentioned in these lessons, I will now report the origin of its name as it contains significant information about antiquity which I do know if historians truly speak about. I begin by examining the doubt that there was already an Oratory there since 750, dedicated to the Holy Arcangel. To be safe with the authoritative documents, I will first say that shortly after the year 1000 there was a Parish Church with a contiguous garden that was called San Michele in Orto(garden). It was situated in the most dignified place in the city and was truly more venerable than any other which was in Florence. The fact that it was a Parish is very clear from the very ancient sources, which declare it as such in a testament in the Badia Archive number 25 among the following witnesses: Filippus Pieri Ranerii, S. Micaelis in orto 1100. In many ancient contracts of the Mozzi family, who lived along the route that passes by S. Gregorio to the Arno River, the parish of San Michele in Orto is mentioned. It later passed to the Cistercian monks of the abbey of S. Silvestro di Nonatola, but I have not been able to find a source for this. The truth is that Pope Innocentius III, in one of his notes from Viterbo in 1209, confirms to said Monks that this church was still of S. Michele: Ecclesias S. Felicis, S. Martini in Mamma, &amp;amp; S. Michaelis intus Flor. Afterwards, when the Republic had to reassume its patronage and claimed its ancient rights, it had to displace the Cistercians, which was met with some disgust from Rome which can be found in the Reformations in a letter from Papa Inocenzio IV dating back to 1249. In it, the republic was urged to return the church to the abbey of Nonantola, together with the castle of S. Martino. The effects of this exhortation can be seen in the resolutions of the republic. Since the Signoria needed a piazza for the sale of grain and large rooms to store it, they had the church leveled, as it was considered a very opportune location. A Loggia was then to be built, of which the Migliore says the following on page 530: “With the design of Arnolfo Panno 1284 which was founded on the ancient church of S. Michele.” To not lose the memory of such an ancient church, the Republic wanted Arnolfo to build another one in front of the new Loggia at the same time. This is the present oratory, called S. Michele Vecchio but today called S. Carlo. The reason for this is that S. Carlo da Paolo (Borromeo) had recently been canonized and the fame of his holiness penetrated everywhere. The main cities, especially Florence, were filled with devotion to the saint. After remembering about the ancient passage from Florence to Milan, made by the Borromeans, and of the space made for the saint, he ordered some relics to be brought from Milan to Florence. The first of these relics was a large piece of the shirt he was wearing when he died and a sponge which had been used to collect his blood. The solemnity in receiving them was very great due to the devotion among the people. However, Cosimo II foresaw that the place where these relics were to be placed was very narrow to celebrate the sacred translation. Wanting to give a sign of his usual devotion and grateful to show himself courteous to the offers from the Cardinal, he signed a memorial to the Company of the Lombards, to whom they were to direct the relics. This granted the brothers the oratory of San Michele as a more capable place than the church of S. Miniato, where the company gathered having already moved from S. Pier del Murrone, today called S. Giovannino in Via di S. Gallo. Furthermore, his highness wanted the captains of Or. S. Michele who had the dominion of the oratory to donate it by decree of 1616, on the condition that no coat of arms would ever be placed on it (arme). Then, the very ancient painting depicting a dead Christ was removed from the high altar and was transferred to the door inside. It was replaced afterwards by Matteo Roselli’s painting, in which S. Carlo was dressed as a cardinal – a glorious, shiny, and resplendent figure surrounded by angels. Among them, in the first place was S. Michele with his insignia. However, the captains foresaw that the new veneration to S. Carlo would make us forget the Oratory of S. Michele, which was illustrated by Pope Alexander VII in the ninth year of his pontificate of a perpetual indulgence for the Brothers on the Feast of St. Charles. The grandstand of the altar had been erected in ancient times by the Pilli Consular Family, of which Dante speaks in Canto XVI of Paradiso: Great was the column of the Vajo. In the scriptures of Or. S. Michele we read “High altar of the Oratory of S. Michele made in the execution of the testament of Messer Bindo dei Pilli in the year 1376”. On the left, as you enter, you can see a panel by Fabbrizio Boschi who portrayed the presentation of Christ in the temple with a beautiful design and a vivacity of colors. As a sign of the patronage of the captains, their unifom is carved in gilded bronze characters which are the three letters: O.S.M. Finally I return to the loggia of Or. S. Michele, which was said to have been a tower for grain storage supported by 16 pillars. It was subsequently judged by the Grand Duke Cosimo I to be a suitable place to store and preserve documents and historical writings from fire and water. A medal was made with the effigy of the Grand Duke and his name on one side, and on the reverse was the open door of the archives, with many illustrated books for protocols with crowns on the title page and letters around it which said: Publica Fidei. There is still an inscription on the door of the archives located in the via Calimala in gold lettering and it says: “ARCHIVIVM HOC PERPETVITATI PVBLICORVM MONIMENTORVM CONSERVANDAE DICATVM SERENISS COSMVS MED. EREXIT . QVAMPRIMVM MAGNVS DVX HETRVRIAE SALVTATVS REGIAQVE corona insignitvs est mdlxix.” I thought I had finished my historical memoirs about Or. S. Michele, however, I should speak of an indispensable piece of information without which the reader would misunderstand the officials of Or. San. Michele. Two magistrates had similar appelations. The first was responsible for the care of the Piazza or Loggia, regarding the sale of wheat and fodder. The second magistrate was in charge of the good governance of the company and Oratory of the Madonna of Or. S. Michele, along with extensive jurisdiction over the goods donated to the Holy Image. This difference between these two positions appears in the Carnera Fiscale in the book marked 1344, which contains various decrees and writings of the Priori at the Podestà of Florence. Under the date February 27, the following excerpts about grain officials can be found: Filippus Rochi de Capponibus, Zenobius Lapi Risaliti, Dominicus Rizzini Fagioli, &amp;amp; Mattheus Roselli Pictor Officiales extracti pro Comuni Flor. ad Officium Platea O. Si M. pro termino, &amp;amp; tempore quatuor mensium. With this document, I regret to have to note the mistake of Leopoldo del Migliore on page 369 of his Illustrated Florence. Leopoldo stated that the aformentioned Matteo da Rosello was one of the captains of the Madonna of Or. S. Michele even though his name was never mentioned by other scholars. However, if he is not among the captains of the Madonna, he deserved to be placed by Giorgio Vasari among the painters as determined in the above-mentioned election. Among his works is the painting of Hell, which he completed in Or. S. Michele. Going back to Leopoldo’s Illustrated Florence, on the same page we can find the following words: “Painted naturally in that hell were many sad men of that age, among which were the Duke of Athens with his followers, since they were traitors of the lordship of Florence. They had shown themselves contrary to the public interest as they went against freedom and were thieves with evil tongues. The resemblances in the painting were so excellent that those who had known them were able to point them out in the painting. For as long as the painting stood, the following proverb was said in Florence: “He is portrayed in S. Michele and that is enough. This work was done by Matteo di Rossello, an ancient and civil painter.” Returning to the Captains, I must add that these positions were abolished by our Emperor who gave the supervision of the sacred temple to a single gentleman, who is currently Mr. Domenico Baldigiani. I will recall here the twentieth congregation of priests, known as the visitation which recognized its beginning on February 24, 1494. This congregation was composed of exactly 40 priests and they gathered in the church of S. Michele in Palchetto, where the following title can be read on the door: “CONGREGATIO VISITATIONIS PRESBYTERORVM.” Meaning, “Association for the Visitation of Priests.” ### Italiano Originale: Notizie Istoriche della Chiese Fiorentine della Madonna di Orsanmichele Lezione Prima: Molte, e molte sono in Firenze le miracolose Immagini di Maria, tra le quali la più gloriosa andò mai sempre quella di Or S. Michele o si voglia per la moltiplicità dei secoli, o per la quantità dei miracoli, o per la qualità degli onori; i quali tre privilegi mi piace di far vedere in questa Lezione. Ma prima dir si vuole del suo sovrano Tabernacolo nella vaghezza del disegno, e nella ricchezza dei marmi sorpassante ogni umana estimazione: movendomi a ciò fare la mancanza di molte pregevoli notizie tralasciate da Francesco Bocchi, da Giovanni Cinelli, e da Filippo Baldinucci, i quali scrissero di quest’Oratorio; e più assai ne poteva scrivere Giorgio Vasari nella vita di Andrea Orcagna ; tutta volta ToM’ I. Fart’ L A Tuttavolta principierò dal riportare quello, che sommariamente egli scrisse come appresso “Poco poi avendo gli Uomini della Compagnia di Or S. Michele messi insieme molti denari di limosine, e beni stati donati a quella Madonna per la mortalità del 1348. Risolverono volerle fare intorno una Cappella, ovvero Tabernacolo non solo di marmi in tutti i modi intagliati , e di altre pietre di pregio ornatissimo, e ricco, ma di mosaico ancora , e di ornamenti di bronzo, quanto più desiderare si potesse , in tanto che per opera, e per materia avanzasse ogni altro lavoro infino a quel dì per tanta grandezza stato fabbricato ; perciò dato carico di tutto all’Orcagna, come al più eccellente di quell’età, egli fece tanti disegni, che finalmente uno ne piacque a chi governava, come migliore di tutti gli altri; onde allogato il lavoro a lui, si rimisero in tutto al giudizio , e consiglio suo, perchè egli dato a diversi maestri d’intaglio avuti di più paesi, a fare tutte le altre cose, attese con il suo fratello a condurre tutte le Figure dell’opera , e finito il tutto le fece murare, e commettere insieme molto consideratamente senza calcina con ispranghe di rame impiombate, acciocché i marmi lustrati, e puliti non si macchiassero, la qual cosa gli riuscì tanto bene con utile, ed onore di quelli, che sono stati dopo di lui , che a chi considera quell’opera, pare mediante tale unione, e commettiture trovate dall’Orcagna, che tutta la Cappella sia cavata di un pezzo di marmo solo . E ancorché ella sia di maniera Tedesca, in quel genere ha tanta grazia, e proporzione, ch’ ella tiene il primo luogo fra le cose di quei tempi, essendo massimamente ii suo componimento di Figure grandi e piccole, e di Angeli, e di Profeti di mezzo rilievo intorno alla Madonna benissimo condotti. E’ maraviglioso ancora il getto dei recingimenti di bronzo diligentemente puliti, che girando intorno a tutta l’opera la racchiuggono, e serrano insieme di maniera che essa ne rimane non meno gagliarda, e forte, che in tutte le altre parti bellissima.” “Ma quanto egli si affaticasse per mostrare in quella età grossa la sottigliezza del suo ingegno, si vede in una Storia grande di mezzo rilievo nella parte di dietro di detto Tabernacolo, dove in fìgure di un braccio, e mezzo l’una fece i dodici Apostoli, che in alto guardano la Madonna, mentre in una mandorla circondata di Angioli saglie al Cielo, in uno dei quali Apostoli ritrasse se stesso vecchio, com’era, con la barba rasa col cappuccio avvolto al capo, e col viso piatto, tondo. Oltre a ciò scrisse a basso nel marmo queste parole: Andreas Cionis Pictor Florentinus Oratorii Archimagister exstitit bujus 1359.” Sin qui il Vasari nulla dicendo della varietà dei preziosi marmi, e rarissime pietre, nulla delle tante belle fìgure, e statue, e nulla de misteri effigiati nei bassi rilievi; anzi egli accennando quello della SS. Vergine Assunta prende uno sbaglio, ove dice, che gli Apostoli guardano la Madonna salita in Cielo, conciossiacosaché non uno, ma due sono i bassi rilievi qui divisi in due quadri, nel primo dei quali in alto evvi la Vergine Assunta circondata dagli Angioli con appiè della Tavoia alcuni alberi lavorati con rara finezza, e nel secondo spartimento da basso , che nulla ha che fare coll’altro divisato, vedesi la Madonna morta attorniata dagli Apostoli, tra’quali, egli è vero , che l’Orcagna ritrasse se stesso, ma non già vecchio , come il suddetto Scrittore disse, avvegnachè il bravo Artefice morisse nel 1389. di anni 60. e però nel 1359. nel quale finì il Tabernacolo, doveva avere anni 30. senza più. E principiando quì a supplire nelle cose, che sì desiderano negli Scrittori di questa Cappella , notar mi piace in primo luogo, come un bellissimo disegno di quest’Opera con sue misure fatto di propria mano dell’Orcagna vedesì al presente, dopo un corso di anni 400. benissimo conservato nell’ insigne Libreria degli antichi manoscritti, e spogli del già Senatore Carlo Strozzi , e noi mercè la cortesia del Signor Carlo Tommaso suo degno Nipote ne diamo in rame la figura. Or venendo alla esatta descrizione, nell’angolo della Loggia verso il mezzo di (Continua alla seguente pagina) Mezzo di il mio Leggitore incontrerà una platea ornata di vari marmi, alta quanto uno scalino, e larga tre braccia, la quale ricorre intorno al Tabernacolo coperto da una tribuna a cupola, e circondato di ricca balaustrata, posando su d’una scalinata pure di marmo. Nei quattro angoli del cancello lavorato con arabeschi di bronzo veggonsi quattro piedistalli, che sostengono una colonna spirale, sul di cui capitello evvi una statua rappresentante un Angioìo: queste colonne sono alte braccia quattro, e tre quarti, e gli Angioli braccia uno, e un quarto. Dentro poi a questa nobile balaustrata si innalza il tanto commendato Tabernacolo retto da quattro pilastri, ciascuno dei quali ha nove colonne alte braccia tre, e un sesto, e grosse un quarto, tra l’una, e l’altra di esse veggendosi pietre dure rilucenti con abbondevolezza di lapislazzuli non solamente nei pilastri, ma nelle basi, e negli archi della Cupola. Dodici sono i Profeti, quali alti un braccio, e mezzo girano sull’architrave, avendo ciascuno un cartello in mano esprimente le virtù di Maria Vergine, e sonovi quattro guglie lavorate alla Gottica alte braccia sei, e un ottavo senza la base, le quali mettono in mezzo la Cupola alta braccia sei, e un quarto, e nel più alto di esta un Angiolo alto braccia due. Nè dall’occhio fuggire ci debbono i vaghi arabeschi, e fogliami finissimi di marmo sparsi da per tutto in sì fatta guisa, che miracolosi piuttosto che rari sono riputati ; e per fine nell’imbasamento della Tribuna in bassi rilievi graziosissimi otto misteri si rappresentano, e sono la Natività di Maria, la sua Presentazione al Tempio, lo Sposalizio con San Giuseppe, la Nunziata , la Nascita di Cristo, l’Epifania , la Circoncisione , e nell’ottavo, giusta l’antica tradizione, l’Artefice effigiò un Angelo, che porta alla Vergine una palma quale annunzio di sua vicina morte. Nel mezzo adunque di così ragguardevole Tribuna sopra un ricco altare circondata da bellissimi Angioli di rilievo adorasi la Tavola tanto famosa nei Mondo tutto dell’Immagine di Maria Vergine, detta la Madonna. Madonna di Or S. Michele potentissima Avvocata dei Fiorentini. Ma perché moderno Autore Toscano per altro letterato, qual si fu Giulio Mancini ,in un suo discorso di pittura, che lasciò scritto a penna, nega , che questa Immagine fosse dipinta da Ugolino Sanese , io riporterò quì la dotta difesa dal Baldinucci scritta nella vita dell’Orcagana, come segue : “Soggiungeremo per ultimo, che lo Scrittor moderno, di cui parlammo pur dianzi, ha creduto equivoco del Vasari, l’aver affermato, che la sacra Immagine di Maria Vergine ornata da questo Tabernacolo fosse fatta per mano di Ugolino morto nel 1349. ed essendo l’immagine stata dipinta nel 1284. Non gli pareva verisimile, che in quel tempo, cioè del 1284. Ugolino avesse potuto essere ben istruito in pittura, che potesse avere una tal’opera dipinta, e che la maniera si avvicinava più alla Greca, che a quella, che allora usavasi in Firenze; e finalmente che l’Immagine è sopra a legno, e Vasari dice, che fosse fatta da Ugolino nel pilastro. Ma se bene si considera, non avrà più luogo il dubbio del soprannominato Autore, prima perchè il Vasari nella sua prima edizione dice, che Ugolino morì non già nel 1349 ma nel 1339 e tanto nella prima, che nella seconda edizione afferma, che Ugoiino morisse in età decrepita; sicché fatto bene il conto, egli nel 1284. potè essere in età di 30 o di 35 anni almeno, e conseguentemente nel più bello del suo operare. Secondariamente dice il Vasari nella prima edizione, e nella seconda ancora a lettere apertissime, che Ugolino operò di maniera Greca, anzi, che tale antica maniera volle egli sempre ostinatamente tenere, non ostante che da molti Pittori del suo tempo, e dallo stesso Giotto sì operasse di assai miglior maniera : sicchè per questo stesso dobbiamo dire, che la pittura è mano di Ugolino . Che poi ella sìa sopra legno, o sopra muro, forse può essere, che lo Stampatore delle opere di Vasari in luogo di dire: fece l’Immagine di nostra Donna per un pilastro della Loggia ec. dicesse: in un pilastro e quando anche cosi aves. E quando anche cosi avesse detto il Vasari troviamo ancora, che il medesimo, e con Iui molti di coloro, che hanno scritte vite dei Pittori, hanno usato dire, fece una tavola nella tal Chiesa, e non per questo s’intende che quella tavola fosse fatta in quella Chiesa , ma per quella Chiesa, non nella tal Cappella , ma per queìla Cappella, cioè che dovea andare in quella Chiesa, o Cappella. Così l’aver detto il Vasari, Ugolino fece la Nostra Donna nel pilastro, non ci toglie il poter credere, che egli volesse dire, che Ugolino avesse sopra tavola fatta l’immagine per rapportarsi, e sìtuarsi poi nel pilastro, onde il dubbio par che si riduca ad una mera cavillazione.” E così compiuto avendo all’obbligo di rintracciare tutte le più notevoli cose di questa Cappella, passerò io a ragionare dei privilegi singolari della Santissima Immagine. E facendomi dalla moitiplicità degli anni, ne quali ella è a Fiorentini in venerazione osservare debbo, che l’anno 1292 benchè sia il tempo notato da Giovanni Villani, e dagli Scrittori, nel quale strepitosi erano i miracoli , non è però l’epoca giusta, avvegnachè io trovo la insigne Compagnia della Madonna di Or. S. Michele principiata nel 1291 il qual anno necessariamente suppone, che prima di qualche tempo fosse già in grande venerazione nel pilastro la miracolosa Tavola , onde sembra, che si possa stabilire , che dopo al 1284 nel qual anno fu fabbricata la loggia, ivi venisse collocata la santissima Tavola. Onde sarebbero già anni 460 e più, contando solamente dal 1291 principio dalla Compagnia. E piacemiquì fare non dispregevole riflessione sopra una maravigliosa combinazione di due Santuari nello stesso tempo principiati, e diventati famosi in tutto il Mondo: imperciocchè in questo tempo appunto, quando II Cielo aprì in Firenze nella nostra Immagine un fonte, o piuttosto un fiume di grazie, gli Angioli portarono la Casa di Nazaret dalla Palestina nell’Italia. E se Pontefici Imperatori, Re, e Principi rendettero magnifico ii Tempio Lauretano, la sola Repubblica Fiorentina, come poscia vedremo, non guardando a spendere immensi tesori, fabbricò alla Madonna di Or S. Michele una delle più splendide, e superbe Chiese, come parlano i libri delle Riformagioni “Un fiat Beatissime Virgini Marie S. Michaelis in Orto templum splendidissimum, &amp;amp; supra modum splendidissimum. E se alla S. Casa di Loreto da tutte le parti del Mondo divoti Pellegrini si portano, anche da diverse parti dell’Europa venivano i Popoli con larghissìme offerte, e voti a venerare la nostra Immagine, cosi scrivendo la Signoria a Papa Urbano V. nel 1364. Ad quod sere concurrunt homines de variis Mundi partibus. E dopo sì bella digressione tornando alia nostra Immagine, non debbo tralasciar di dire alcunché della Compagnia di Or S. Micheie, come il più autorevole documento dimostrante l’antichità delia miracolosa Tavola: nè meglio io saprei farlo, che riportando sommariamente i Capitoli antichi della medesima Compagnia scritti di carattere del XIV. secolo, e comunicatimi dall’erudito, e cortese Sig. Domenico Maria Manni, il prologo dei quali è come segue “In nome del Padre, del Figliolo, e dello Spirito Santo. Amen. Ad honore, &amp;amp; reverentia del Nostro Signore Gesù Christo, e de la sua Santissima Madre Madonna Santa Maria sempre Vergine, e del Beato Messer Santo Michele Arcangelo, &amp;amp; del Beato Messer Santo Lorenzo, e di tutta la Corte di Paradiso , e ad honore , e reverentia de la Santa Chiesa di Roma , &amp;amp; del Nostro Signore Messer lo Papa, e dei suoi Frati Segnori Cardinali, e di Messer lo Vescovo di Firenze, e ad stato, e honore, e mantenimento de la Città di Firenze, e del suo distretto, ad bene e consolatione dei Poveri. Questi sono i Capitoli, e gli ordini di quelli, che sono, e saranno de la detta Compagnia, la quale fu cominciata negli anni de la Incarnatione del Nostro Segnore Iesu Christo, MccLxxxxi. il dì di Beato Messer Santo Lorenzo del mese di Agosto.” Quaranta sono i capitoli, quali io comprendo in tre soli più che sufficienti, onde viemaggiormente corroborare l’alta venerazione dei popoli a quest’immagine. E nel primo rammentare si deve la maniera, che tenevasi per consolare l’immenso popolo, che in folla chiedeva di essere ascritto alla Compagnia, la quale teneva stipendiato un Notaio obbligato in tutti i giorni feriali, e solenni di stare a desco a registrare i nomi dei fratelli, e delle sorelle, che vi si ascrivevano, e perché uno non reggeva al concorso dei devoti, si prese l’espediente, che gli stranieri, e quelli del Contado si facessero scrivere nel popolo, del quale era la Porta, onde essi entravano in Città, e con raro esempio trovasi nel capitolo XXXVII che si ascrivevano alla Compagnia anche i morti, sol che uno ne portasse al Notaio il nome del defunto , quale scritto nel libro, si faceva l’anima sua partecipe dei suffragi; della qual grazia se ne dava la poliza segnata col suggello della Compagnia avente per impronta la Nunziata, ed intorno scritte queste lettere: Sigillum Societatis Virg. Marie Sancti Mich. in orto de Florentia. Al secondo capitolo ristringo tutto quello, che la Compagnia faceva sotto le logge, dirò al sacro Pilastro, giacchè in quei primi tempi non trovasi nei capitoli nominato Oratorio. In ogni sera adunque si cantavano le laudi da i fratelli chiamati Laudesi, e con maggior solennità di canto nelle vigilie delle feste del Signore , di Maria, degli Apostoli, e dei Santi Avvocati della Citta, facendosi nella notte precedente a simiglianti Feste una illuminazione generale di tutta la Loggia, In tutte le Domeniche dell’anno , ed in altri giorni solenni facevasi fare la predica nella Loggia per sufficienti Predicatori, scelti o dal Clero, o dalle Religioni, delle quali prediche l’ora era dopo il Vespro. Quattro poi guardie in tutta la giornata assidue tenevansi al Pilastro, e due nella notte per ricevere le offerte di cera, di vesti, e di danaro, e talora erano più copiose le limosine, che facevansi di notte, E finalmente al terzo capitolo pertinenti sono gli esempi di carità , e di pietà, che dai fratelli davansi e per la Città, e per il Contado: devotissime erano due processioni generali di tutta la Compagnia in Ciascun’anno a due di queste Chiese, S. Marco, S. Spirito, S. Croce, S. Maria Novella , il Carmine, e la Nonziata, ripigliando il giro ogni tre anni, coll’offerta per ciascuno Fratello di una candela di un’oncia. Ogni Lunedì si facevano celebrar sei Messe in varie Chiese per i Fratelli defunti, sicché a tutte dentro l’anno toccava almeno una Messa, alla quale assister dovea un’Ufiziale della Compagnia dando dodici soldi al Prete. Ma la cosa più plausibile era una limosina generale , oltre le quotidiane, la quale facevasi in tutti i Sesti di Firenze, e nel suo Contado, e per vero dire era il giorno di tutto l’anno il più lieto per i poveri, tra quali comprendevansi tutti i Monasteri , Spedali , Prigioni , e Romiti, trovandosi nei Libri della Compagnia avere importato somigliante carità talvolta 37000. lire, delle quali cose andò viepiù crescendo la fama della nostra Madonna di Or S. Michele, e della Compagnia a lei dedicata. E se ho sin quì ragionato del Libro dei Capitoli, mi si conceda di riportare il titolo, che leggesi nel principio di altro Libro detto Campion Verde, ed è come segue : “Codex bonorum piissima Societatis Gloriosissime Virg. Maria S. Michaelis in Orto, merito in toto Orbe re &amp;amp; fama memoratissima, ob suum devotissimum Oratorium sub famoso Templo , ac su pramodnm Eminentissimo, eius nomine fundatum pariter &amp;amp; sonstrutum.” Ma avendo chiamata più fiate miracolosa questa Immagine, qui dir si vuole i moltiplici miracoli a quel Pilastro gia corona facienti, e con tanta abbondevolezza, che Giovanni Villani arrestando il corso alla sua Storia, come a cosa insolita, e di grande stupore , ne scrisse le seguenti parole “Adì 3. di Luglio 1292. si cominciò a mostrare grandi, e aperti miracoli nella Città di Firenze per una figura di S. Maria dipinta in un Pilastro della Loggia di Or S. Michele, dove si vende il grano, sanando infermi, e rizzando attratti, e sgombrando imperversaci visibilmente in gran quantità” E lo stesso afferma S. Antonino nella Terza Parte di sua Storia come appresso: Eodem anno (1292.) mense Iulii patrata sunt quadam miracula Florentia ex quadam Figura Virginis Gloriosa, qua erat in pariete picta atrii, seu horti S. Michaelis, ubi tunc forum erat frument, &amp;amp; aliorum bladorum. Nam concepta devotione ab omnibus ad Figuram illam infirmis devote orantibus, plures sanati sunt exvariis languoribus, claudi erecti, contracti sanati, &amp;amp; obsessi a doemonibus liberati. E gli stessi prodigi si rammentano di questo Santo Simolacro da Sozomeno Pistoiose nella sua Istoria generale del mondo, la quale in cartapecora conservasi nella libreria dei Canonici Regolari della Badia di Fiesole, come scrive nella sua Biblioteca Pistoiese il Padre Antonio Zaccaria, che non gran diligenza, e somma erudizione ho dato alle stampe, leggendosi nella suddetta Istoria come segue: Anno 1292. Die 3. Mensis Iulii Figura picta B. Virginis Maria, qua erat in horto S. Michaelis fecit multa miracula sanando infirmos &amp;amp; elaudos, unde fuit maxima devotio totius populi &amp;amp; finitimorum, &amp;amp; tantum aucta est, quod singulis annis distribuebantur sex mille libbra, &amp;amp; usque ad hodiernum diem extat devotio. Ed in sì fatta guisa parlano tutti gli Scrittori Toscani, niuno però, che io sappia, avendo notato il più ammirabile di tutti i prodigi, che fu l’essere la stessa miracolosa Tavola rimasa illesa dall’incendio in Firenze procurato da Ser Neri Abati nel 1304., avendo per altro le fiamme arse non solamente le case contigue, ma la Loggia stessa. Altri miracoli ancora si possono osservare dipinti nei vetri delle finestre, le quali è stato creduto da taluno, che fossero le prime in città a vedersi dipinte, dopo che di fiandra fu portato il segreto a Firenze. Intanto la quantità, e qualita di questi miracoli produsse vari effetti, quali io non posso non rammentare, ed il primo derivato da sì alta cagione fu, che alcuni religiosi maestri in divinita, non dando facilmente fede ai quotidiani prodigi, che raccontavansi, giudicarono in materia sì gelosa di culto, e di fede, di fare alcuni esami sopra la verita dei prodigi, e darne al popolo saggi avvertimenti, cosa che loro suscito una piccola persecuzione della plebe, imputando loro ad invidia quello, che era puro zelo della gloria di Dio, e di Marià, come ne scrive S. Anronino nella Terza Parte della sua Storia, rigettando il detto mordace di Giovanni Villani, e di altri Scrittori, e le parole del Santo sono le seguenti : Fratres’ autem Predicatores &amp;amp; Minores, quia parum fidei dabant dictis miraculis, Populus, qui leviter movetur, eis detrahebat, &amp;amp; obloquebatur contra eos, adscribens invidia, quod erat vera pietatis. Ma un altro effetto ben contrario al suddetto seguì dalla stupenda abbondevolezza dei miracoli, i qualì a tutte le ore tirando poveri infermi, e concorrendovi moltissimi curiosì ad essere testimoni di soprannaturali avvenimenti, e risuonando l’aria di mille benedizioni, ne venne, che la Loggia destinata alla vendita del grano, era ad ogni ora ingombrata dalla folla dei divoti, onde fu costretta la Signoria a serrarela Loggia , e non ho ben certo l’anno, riducendola a Chiesa, non senza grave rammarico ed opposìzione di parecchi Cittadini del Gran Consglio, cui spiaceva , che fosse levata la bellezza alla più maestosa fabbrica di Firenze , e che noi a suo tempo descriveremo. Le somme poi larghissìme depositate nelle mani dei Custodi del Pilastro, ed i iasciti considerabilissimi, furono il terzo, e principal frutto delle tante miracolose grazie. Io però delle molte, e ricche offerte una sola per ora ne riferirò, e fu quella, che fecero i Fiorentini nel 1348. anno della gran peste, trovandosi nei libri dei Capitani di Or S. Michele, che ascendesse alla somma di Fiorini d’oro 35,000. chiamata da Matteo Villani tesoro incredibile per lo valore della Moneta, che non si legge un lascito così grosso tutto in un anno fosse fatto giammai a nestun altro Santuario di quei tempi. Ma dappoichè di questa Immagine abbiamo rammentati i pregi di sua antichità , e dei suoi miracoli, ragion vuole, che parliamo degli onori ricevuti e dal Pubblico, e dai Privati ; e per non istare a narrare la lunga serie delle ordinazioni fatte dalla Repubblica riguardanti il culto dì nostra Donna, io me ne sono scelte alquante delle più memorabili, che sono contrassegni pregiatissimi di onorevolezza a questo Oratorio, rimettendo ad altra Lezione il porre in veduta le sollecitudini della Signoria in volere adornata la Loggia delle più commendate opere dell’Architettura, Scultura, e Pittura. Principiando adunque da quell’azione , la quale accrebbe divozione, e insìememente rispetto grandissìmo verso il Santo Tabernacolo, non vi ha dubbio, che ella fu, l’essersi presa dalla Repubblica per Avvocata speciale dei Fiorentini la Madonna di Or S. Michele a voce di tutto il popolo convocato nella gran Piazza dei Signori nel 13.di Agosto del 1365. Al suono della Campana grossa, come era solito a farsi in tutte le risoluzioni gravi; e correlativa a questa elezione fu la Legge del 1366. colla quale ad ogni Cittadino statuale si ordinava di mandare a Or S. Michele un drappellone; e se era Uomo di arme, una Targa; ed a questo stesso fine retto dalla pietà, che più desiderar non si poteva verso il Santuario , per altra Legge del 1386. si aspettava ai Rettori delle Chiese, ed ai Superiori delle Religioni nella Festa dell’Assunta di fare un’offerta a questo Altare, sul quale nello stesso solennissimo giorno il Gonfaloniere servendo di esempio a tutti , a mezza Messa offeriva quì un regalo di frutte. Ma aumentandosi sempremai l’ardore in tutti di fare nuovi onori a Maria, inventò dipoi il Popolo Figure di uomini ritratti al naturale alti quanto il vivo, colle teste, e mani di cera colorita, con capelliere, vesti, fogge, ed ogni altro ornamento all’usanza di quei tempi, e di somiglianti voti se n’empiè talmente la Loggia, che per proverbio si diceva, quando si voleva significare una moltitudine di cose “Sarebbon’elleno mai tante quanti i Boti di Gr. S, Michele ?” dei quali parla pure S. Antonino nella Parte Terza della sua Storia così; &amp;amp; in proccssu temporis est repletus locus imaginibus cereis. E tornando alle sante Leggi della Repubblica riguardanti la venerazione, e stima di si pregiatissìma Immagine , non si deve tacere quella, che obbligava gli uomini di governo a giurare suIl’altar venerabile di Or S. Michele direttamente amministrare le cose del pubblico , ed attestano i Libri di Ricordanze di quei tempi, che nessuno si Sarébbe accostato con livida coscienza per farvì giuramento o pubblico, o privato, tenendosi per certo da tutti, che se la intenzione loro non fosse stata sincera, si sarebbero veduti gastighi esemplari; e trovasi un’antico Statuto alla Rubrica 115. del Libro II. col quale nullo si dichiarava qualunque giuramento, che non fosse stato fatto su questo Altare: Nullo modo valeat, neque observetur, nisi tale iuramentum praestitum fuerit coram B. Virgine, &amp;amp; Capitaeneis Orti S. Michaelis. E da un Libro della Compagnia di Or S, Michele coperto di asse si ha il seguente privilegio “1329. ordina la Repubblica Fiorentina, che chi aveste ammazzato alcun suo parente, o altro congiunto, al quale aveste potuto succedere il delinquente nella Eredità , questi ne sia spogliato, e la terza parte dei beni dell’ucciso vadano alla Compagnia della Vergine Maria di Orto San Michele , ed il restante al Comune di Firenze.” Si pensò ancora dai Signori ad accrescere con isquisiti concerti di suono, e canto il pregio, e concorso alle Laudi, che si dicevano all’Oratorio in ogni sera, avendo la Repubblica ordinato con Legge del 1388. che i Musici della Citta, ed i Sonatori di pifferi, e viole di Palazzo nei Sabati, e nelle Feste solenni venissero ad Or S. Michele, costume per vero dire, che in qualche parte ancora in oggi si conserva. E quì mi si conceda, benchè fuori del suo luogo, di aggiugnere due partite di limosine fatte dalla Compagnia di Or S. Micheìe , quali possono dar lume alla Storia Fiorentina, e che non seppi, quando sopra scrissi dei Capitoli della Compagnia, avendole avute dal Sig. Domenico Maria Manni, che le trovò nei libri della medesima, e sono “1306 limosina Fior. ic, aila Giovanna Romita da Signa, portò Chele Lapi Laudese da San Friano.” Questa è la Beata da Signa, e dice il Libro a carte 49. per suo mantenimento, o per dispensarla. Nel Libro del 1307 vi ha altra limosina, e dice a persona, che sta sulle Fosse della Porta dell’Alloro Oste (cioè pigionale) Giotto di Bondone, questi è l’insigne restaurator della Pittura. E per fine in lode di questo Oratorio riporterò alcuni versi del celebre Fra Domenico da Coiella Scrittore del Secolo XV. non meno celebre per le teologiche sue opere, che per la poetica arte , come nota il dotto Autore delle Delizie degli Eruditi nel suo Tomo del 1742. al quale abbiamo grado l’avere dato alle stampe del suddetto Autore il IV. Libro di Elegie sopra le Chiese Fiorentine, dove dice come appresso: &quot;Attamen apparet longe spatiosior intus, Fulget ubi Sancta Matris imago Dei. Hans miro candore nitens complectitur arcus, Sculptilibus pollens undique marmoreis Quorum compages tanta contexitur arte, Ut fibi vix aliud par videatur opus.&quot; Seconda Lezione Motivi dei Grandi nell’ordinare fabbriche assai magnifiche, sogliono essere il genio di voler dimostrare la loro possanza, e ricchezza, ed insiememente il sollecito impegno di accrescere ornamento alle Citrà, e comodo a Cittadini. Ed appunto somiglianti fini ebbe la Repubblica Fiorentina nella fabbrica maestosa, e splendidissima di Or S. Michele. Erano i Fiorentini saliti in gran potenza per mezzo del negozio, e volendo palesare agli occhi di tutto il Mondo lo splendor del loro stato felicemente conservatosi libero, e di più far costare ai Principi il sovrano potere fondato nel valor di molte ricchezze conquistate dalle arti, alzarono questo maraviglioso edifizio, anche in oggi uno dei principali ornamenti di Firenze, destinato già alla conserva dei grani, e dipoi alla custodia della pubblica fede per Archivio Generale. Né debbo tralasciare un altro più nobile motivo derivato dalla pietà Fiorentina verso il miracoloso Tabernacolo della Madonna di Or S. Michele, al cui onore vollero i Signori, che in questo Tempio gareggiassero le maraviglie dell’Architettura, della Scultura, e della Pittura, quali ravviseremo noi in questa Lezione. E facendomi dalla ordinazione fatta dalla Repubblica per il soprallodato fine, benchè se ne sia smarrito l’originale , ne riporterò una imperfetta copia enunciata nel Campione, o sia Libro Verde dei Capitani di Or S. Michele al Cap. X. Templum in statura &amp;amp; forma Palatii cum volta supra coopriente Oratorium, &amp;amp; alia deinceps, &amp;amp; tesso, atquesor formosis beccatellis, ubi tabernaculum Nostra Donna splendidssimum, &amp;amp; supra modum superbissimum, nec non miris vitris, porfido, &amp;amp; gemmis maximi valoris fundatum super Platea, ubi consueverat esse sorum denominatum Orto di S.

Advocati cuiusque Artis, &amp;amp; in medio lateris dignioris Figura Advocati Partis Guelforum, cioe S. Ludovici, ut sic B.

Flor an. 1309 De mense Aprilis. Abbiamo adunque da così autorevole Libro col pubblico Decreto della nuova Fabbrica la deputazione orrevole dell’ Arte della Seta, detta di Por S. Maria, per la felice e grandiosa esecuzione, e l’epoca certa della fondazione, o piuttosto della innovazione di questo Edifizio, cioè l’anno 1309. A Taddeo Gaddi, in quel tempo Architetto del Pubblico toccò a fare il disegno, che se non prima del 1337 non principiò a rifondare i pilastri: l’impedimento fu cagionato e dall’assedio di Firenze postovi dall’Imperatore Enrico VII. nemico dei Fiorentini fin che visse, e dalla guerra coi Pisani, e Lucchesi , e dalle discordie intestine. Ma ritornata la calma, nel 29 di Luglio del suddetto anno se ne gettò la prima pietra dal Gonfaloniere Strozza di Rosso Strozzi, presente la Signoria, tutti i Magistrati, e seguitati da tutta la gente, colla benedizione del Vescovo Fiorentino Francesco Silvestri da Cingoli. Di così solenne funzione ne parlò Giovanni Villani nel Libro XI. al Capitolo 66. che tralasciando io di riferire, per non ripetere le cose di sopra dette, piuttosto riporterò alquante circostanze notate da Leopoldo dei Migliore a pagina 540. come segue “La funzione, che si faceva a nome dei Guelsi, che erano quelli che dominavano la Città, mai ridottasi in sì felice stato quanto allora, si accompagnò anche col getto di monete d’oro, e di argento, coniate da una parte con l’edifìzio , e queste lettere : Ut magnificentia Populi Flor. „ Artis, &amp;amp; Artificum ostendatur, e dall’altra parte l’Armi della Repubblica, e del medesimo Popolo, e si leggeva : Reip. &amp;amp; Popili Honor &amp;amp; Decus. Chi lo racconta, che per avventura fu presente, dice di più, come anche l’Ambasciatore della Città di Arezzo , vi buttasse non so che moneta piccola. “E sin quì l’Autore della Firenze illustrata. In quanti anni poi fosse la Fabbrica ridotta alla sua perfezione e vaghezza, non è possibile il determinarlo; conciosiacosachè vi si ravvisano tralle pitture alquante di Iacopo da Casentino, di Lorenzo di Credi, di Andrea del Sarto, e di Gio: Antonio Sogliani; fra i tondi, tre se ne veggono di Luca della Robbia, e tralle Statue parecchie di Donatello, e dei suoi Discepoli, che furono tutti Artefici del Secolo XV Onde fa d’uopo il dire, che o vi fossero innovazioni sempre più belle, o che tardi assai si desse l’ultimo compimento al nobile disegno. Avvi pure un altro dubbio circa chi ne fosse l’Architetto: imperciocchè in una cartella in Chiesa leggesi Autore Arnolfo di Lapo; Leopoldo del Migliore ne dà la lode ad Andrea Orcagna, ed il Baidinucci ne fa Architettore Taddeo Gaddi. Ma io credo, che tutti e tre dicano il vero, solo che distinguiamo i tempi, stabilendo che nel 1284 giusta tutti gli Scrittori, Arnolfo per ordine della Signoria fabbricasse la Loggia, in secondo luogo, che nel 1337 Taddeo Gaddi ne rifondasse i pilastri, che erano di mattoni, rivestendogli di pietra, e di marmi, e per fine morto il Gaddi nel 1350. giusta il Vasari, o nel 1352 secondo il Baldinucci, vi lavorasse l’Orcagna, che appunto all’altare della Madonna leggessi questi essere stato Architetto nel 1359. Andreas Cionis Pictor buius Oratorii Arcbimagifter 1359 Circa poi la spesa, scrive il Varchi, che arrivasse ad ottantasei mila fiorini di oro da stimarsi grandissima in ordine al valore della moneta di quei tempi, e ventimila in ridurla da Loggia ad uso di Chiesa, come si è detto di sopra: e donde si cavasse questo danaro, senza aggravare il Comune di nuovo dazio, io trovo nei Libri di Provvisioni agli anni 1339 e 1350. che furono assegnate all’Arte della Seta per proseguir la fabbrica certe gabelle chiamate delle sette Piazze, della Mallevadoria dell’Armi, e che il Villani le addimanda Gabellette, quasi che con questo diminutivo significar volesse, come il poco assegnato , avesse moltiplicato tanto per la felicità del Commercio, da essersi potuta alzar Mole così eccelsa. Mi piace però rammentare un’entrata, che ha dell’incredibile, ma ella è registrata nel libro detto Campione a car 14. ed inoltre dal Villani è notata al Lib. XI. Cap. 91. Questa entrata era la spazzatura della Loggia di Or S. Michele, e prestatura di bigonce , dalla quale cavavansi ogni anno 750 fiorini di oro, dovendosi ancora quì comprendere le stupende limosine, che si facevano dai devoti alla miracolosa Immagine, porzione delle quali si applicava al magnifico ornamento di questo sovrano, e ricchissimo Tempio. E veramente si mostrerà convenirgli questa lode, e molto maggiore ancora, per quel che diremo in descriverne le qualità. La forma sua è quasi quadrangolare, lunga essendo braccia 42 e larga 32. Si alza dal piano della strada alla cima braccia 80 tutta veggendosi incrostata di pietra forte riquadrata, di quella , che resistendo all’acqua, ed ai rigori delle stagioni, se ne murarono, dice il Vasari , quasi tutti gli edifici alla gotica, che si fecero in Toscana in quei tempi, della quale Architettura barbara è anco questa Torre, sebbene in essa si vede un dei primi miglioramenti dell’Arte, nel ricominciar, che ella fece a rinvigorire, e pigliar forza, osservandovisi gli archi, che lasciato il sello acuto sono girati con grazia a porzione di circolo, sopra a pilastri principali della volta vi sono due ordini di Finestroni adornati nei vani di colonnette di marmo, veggendosi nei triangoli dei frontespizi principali le armi della Repubblica, e della Parte Guelfa reiterate in più luoghi, ed ancora sonovi quelle della Casa Reale di Napoli, che è uno scudo dimezzato per lo lungo, da una parte pieno di gigli, dall’altra di listre in piano per il Regno di Ungheria, posseduto, allorachè questa Loggia si fabbricava, da Lodovico di Angiò figliolo di Carlo, che fu tanto amico dei Fiorentini, Protettore, e fermezza del loro stato in favore dei Guelfi, e per segno di gratitudine la Repubblica vi alzò quelle armi, essendo questa la maggior benevolenza, che professasse mai Firenze verso nessun’altro Potentato. Finisce la fabbrica con una corona di rose traforate, che sportando in fuori ,e retta con grazia su certi beccatelli, vi rigira intorno a guisa di parapetto, o sponda. E venendo al terreno ricorre attorno un imbasamento di pietra alto da terra poco più di quattro braccia fino alle nicchie, nelle quali sonovi le Statue dei Santi Avvocati delle Arti, parte di metallo, e parte di marmo, di tutto rilievo, essendo alte più del vivo, e per condurle a perfezione vi si stancò per dir così l’industria dei primi Maestri, e Professori di quei tempi, senza risparmio di spesa in ricompensa del loro valore, parlandosene in un Libro alle Riformagioni segnato F. come appresso “Sapendosi quanto importi dar cuore a chi operando con industria per mero parto dell’intelletto, cerca a lasciar di se onoratissimo nome, e fama alla Patria per mezzo di fatture rare: si vuole, che largamente se ne ricompensino quelli, che già sono stati eletti a far pompa del loro talento, e sapere intorno alle Statue di Or S. Michele.” E per dar ragguaglio di queste Statue principiando dalla parte di Levante a venire dalla via dei Calzaioli, nella prima nicchia evvi S. Luca, segue S. Tommaso, e poi S. Gio; Batista ; verso Mezzodì la prima è di S. Giovanni Evangelista, di S. Giorgio la seconda, viene S. Iacopo, e la quarta è di S. Marco: dalla parte del Magistrato della Lana nel primo pilastro incontrasi S. Lò, dopo vedesi S. Stefano, ed in terzo luogo S. Matteo: e voltando a Tramontana la prima nicchia è vacante per un certo caso, che poi diremo; la seconda è dei quattro Santi , dopo la quale evvi S. Filippo, e nell’ultima San Piero. E ripigliando da S. Luca, ella è di getto fatta da Giovan Bologna per l’Arte dei Giudicì e Notai, o sia del Proconsolo, la cui arme è una stella di oro, che empie tutto il campo di argento, intagliata negli angoli della base. S. Tommaso è di Andrea del Verrocchio discepolo di Donatello per non dire emolo del Maestro, tanto è vivo il Santo, che sembra camminare portato dall’amore a toccare la piaga di Cristo: fu fatto a spese della Mercanzia , che ha per impresa una stella rossa sopra una balla bianca: in virtù di un pubblico Decreto in questa nicchia doveasi collocare S. Lodovico ; il perchè si recedesse da quest’ordine non lo sappiamo; bensì per mercede dell’Artefice ho letto nel Campione Verde, che nel 1483 si ordina, che Andrea sia di tal fattura sodisfatto fino in 800 fiorini Iarghi. II S. Giovan Batista spetta all’Arte dei Mercatanti, già Consoli di Calimala, che portano un’Aquila di oro sopra una balla bianca in campo rossò: la fattura è del Ghiberti, il cui nome è scritto nel lembo dell’abito: ma convien confessare essere figura languida in comparazione delle altre sue opere meravigliose. Il S. Giovanni Evangelista anch’egli di bronzo è opera di Baccio da Montelupo, che lo fece per l’ Arte della Seta con diligenza estrema e felice , della quale Arte l’impresa è una porta rossa in campo di argento. Segue il S. Giorgio, il quale prima stava nella sua nicchia a Tramontana molto proporzionata alla sua grandezza, e poscia diremo la cagione della traslazione; la fecero fare i Corazzai, e Spadai, che fanno per arme un giaco, ed uno stocco : questa figura è stimata da tutti la più bella, ed oltre a quel che ne dice il Vasari, il Bocchi ne ha fatto un trattato intitolato L’Eccelenza della Statua di S. Giorgio fatta da Donatello, che fu stampato nel 1584. dal Marescotti. Alla vicina nicchia viene la Statua di S. Iacopo dell’Arte dei Vaiai, i quali in un campo di azzurro fanno per arme una pecora bianca, e molti vai: piace assai la maniera di questo Santo lavorato da Nanni di Antonio del Bianco. Di Donatello è il S. Marco, di cui Michelagnolo, dicono, che dicesse: “che se tale era il sembiante del Santo vivo gli si poteva creder tutto quanto aveva scritto, tanto mostra cera di galantuomo. Del soprallodato Nanni è San Lò lavorato per l’Arte dei Maniscalchi, come lo dimostra l’Arme loro, che è un paio di tanaglie nere, ed appiè della Statua vedesi un basso rilievo di alcuni occupati ad un’incudine. Ammirabile è il S. Stefano, degna opera del Ghiberti, in premio della quale ebbe anche la grazia di fare l’altra che segue di S. Matteo, quella è dell’Arte della Lana avente per Arme una pecora bianca con banderola bianca, e croce rossa in campo azzurro; questa è dell’ Arte del Cambio, la cui divisa è un campo seminato di monete di oro; e nell’Archivio di detta Arte si conserva un Libro, nel quale oltre il leggersi l’allogazione della Statua al suddetto Ghiberti, trovasi il maneggio di quei Consoli per ottenere questa Nicchia, che era stata data per l’avanti all’Arte dei Fornai per collocarvi la figura di S. Lorenzo loro Protettore: ma stante che ella era Arte poverissima, e che né di presente, né per l’avvenire avrebbero potuto fare una grande spesa, la Signoria nel 21 di Giugno del 1419 essendo Gonfaloniere Niccolò di Franco Sacchetti, col consenso dei medesimi Fornai concedette la Nicchia all’Università dei Cambiatori per farvi la figura di S. Matteo, per la quale ebbe Lorenzo 650. fiorini di oro. Sono anche da osservarsi su questa Nicchia due statuette di marmo lavorate con lode da Niccolò Aretino. Dopo questa viene la nicchia vuota, ove non è rimaso, che nella base un prodigioso mezzo rilievo di Donatello, rappresentante S. Giorgio, che occide il Drago, lodato da Raffaello Borghini con queste parole “si può mirare, ma non imitare” I quattro Santi sono del Nanni, fatti da quattro Arti di Maestri, di scure, o accetta, di scarpello, di mestola, e di altri strumenti fabbrili. La invenzione di collocarveli, che portava sapere per la strettezza del luogo, pose in disperazione l’Artefice, ma il di lui Maestro Donatello colla sola ricompensa d’una cena, a forza di alcuni colpi industriosi scantonò di quelle Statue a chi la spalla, a chi le braccia, talchè ponendo l’una per così dire addosso all’altra, le commesse di modo, che non solo copri l’errore del discepolo, ma riscosse stima, e meraviglia da tutti. Non è dispregevole il S. Filippo, che gli è allato nell’altra nicchia, fatto dal medesimo Nanni alla Università dei Calzolai, quali portano tre listre nere in piano di argento. Ma di vero il S. Piero dell’Arte dei Beccai, quali alzano per arme un becco rampante in campo di argento, è fatto da Donatello con tanto sapere, che è tenuto dal Vasari opera mirabile e rarissima, dove è un panneggiare graziosissimo corrispondente all’attitudine del corpo, in guisa, che meglio non istanno i panni indosso ad uomo vivente. Questo apparato di Statue unire così, ed esposte al pubblico si vede in poche Città, e molti sono venuti di lontani paesi a bella posta per vederle, confessando esser loro parute una Scuola di cose rare da potersene pigliar copia con qualche riserva; e per cagione del rispetto, che convenevolmente pretesero i Fiorentini, che si portasse a sì preziose nicchie, abbiamo lo Statuto, che impone pena a chi o vi tirasse sassi, o facessè loro qualche oltraggio. Bella veduta ancora fanno i vani degli Archi tra un pilastro, e l’altro, adornati di quattro altissime colonne, su ciascuna delle quali posa una Statua di un braccio e mezzo di altezza, che in tutte sono quaranta, veggendosi i capitelli e dei pilastri, e delle colonne ornati a foglia di acanto rustica, siccome vaghissimi sono i rabeschi, che empiono gli archi, restando da osservarsi sopra le nicchie le pitture nei dodici tondi, totalmente guaste, eccettuate tre che sono di terra inverniciata di Luca della Robbia, rappresentanti una Madonna col Bambino in collo sopra il pilastro di S. Giorgio, l’Arme della Repubblica sopra S. Tommaso, e sopra S. Giovanni Evangelista la divisa dell’Arte di Por Santa Maria. Resterebbemi a ragionare dell’accennata traslazione in Chiesia della Statua della Madonna dalla nicchia della Università dei Medici, e Speziali, nella quale oggi si vede collocato San Giorgio. Ma dovendosi in altra Lezione assembrare i moltiplichi pregi rilucenti nell’ interiore de Tempio, in essa parleremo ancora della Sroria di questo Simolacro, riportando quì per fine in lode di tale Meravigliosa fabbrica altri versi del celebre Poeta Domenicano, e sono i seguenti: “Nunc ubi magna domus pracelsa turris ad instar Fertur in aereas altius una plagas. Qua licet ex omni videatur splendida parte Sanctorum Statuas dum soris ipsa tenet. Attamen apparet longe speciosor intus Fulget ubi Sancta Matris Imago Dei.” Terza Lezione Il ragionare degli interiori pregi di questa Chiesa con ordine, non si può quasi fare senza deferenza al prodigioso Altare della Madonna di Or S. Michele già da noi descritto nella prima Lezione di questa Storia, dovendo qui aggiungere ai sopraddetti titoli, i laudevoli usi fatti di sue grandi ricchezze assembrate nel florido stato della Repubblica, ed il sacro quotidiano servizio a quell’Altare. E per farmi dal primo ne noterò un lolo documento indicante i gran tesori spesì in opere pie dai Superiori dell’Oratorio, mercechè i Capitani oltre lo splendido, e nobile mantenimento della Chiesa, potettero somministrare grandi somme di danaro per le fabbriche dei Monasteri di Chiarito, di Lapo, e di San Giorgio, i quali sono oggi reputati al pari di ogni altro Monastero esemplare di Firenze, constando queste fondazioni dai rogiti di Ser Michele di Ghirolfo da Lucardo 1342 e di Ser Salvestro Salvesfri 1405 nell’Archivio Generale. Circa poi al secondo punto riferir mi piace la istituzione fatta dalla Rep nel 1415. di una Collegiata di dieci Preti, e due Cherici, con un Capo loro chiamato Proposto; la quale erezione trovasi registrata in un Libro coperto di asse nell’Archivio dei Capitani, ove sì legge ancora , che fino a quei tempo l’Oratorio era stato ufiziato da un solo Prete col titolo di Sagrestano. Questi Preti hanno il privilegio dei Cappuccio pavonazzo, e coll’intervento dei Musici assistono alle solite Laudi di Maria nelle Feste, ed in ogni Sabato alio scoprimento della sacra Immagine col canto delle Litanie, nel qual tempo ardono 26 candele con questo ordine di 12 all’Altare, 6 ai viticci, ed otto alla ghirlanda, siccome nella Messa alla Consacrazione sempre debbono accendersi due Ceri per legato di Luca di Filippo Carnesecchi Gentiluomo Fiorentino, il quale nel suo Testamento del 1601, rogato da Ser Antonio di Ser Chello dice “Lascio due doppieri di cera gialla di libbre 15 in perpetuo da accendersi alla Madonna di Or S. Michele nel tempo della elevazione dell’ Ostia. E passando ora a rammentar quanto di sacro, e di bello avvi in quest’Oratorio dirò, che appoggiato al pilastro, che sta allato a questa Cappella, trovasi un Crocifisso di legno in gran venerazione appresso i Fiorentini, con tutto che sia mal fatto, di maniera antica, alto più del vivo. Credesi sull’autorità di tutti gli Scrittori della vita del Santo Arcivescovo Antonino, che egli fusse consueto andarvi ad orare, quando era fanciullo, che in quell’età vedesi dipinto appiè della Croce. Non ci pare però di potere acconsentire a chi senza autorevole documento disse, che quel Crocifisso parlasse più fiate al Santo, e molto meno che sia lavorato del legno di quell’Olmo secco, il quale rifiorì nella traslazione del corpo di S. Zanobi, credo però al Rondinelli, che nel suo Ragguaglio della peste dice come segue “I Frati di S. Marco molti Venerdì in processione andarono al Crocifisso di Or S. Michele, al quale S. Antonino fanciulleto orava” ringraziar debbo que’Benefattori, i quali nell’anno 1714 fecero a questo divino Simolacro un Tabernacolo di ricco intaglio attorno tutto dorato con baldacchino, e pendoni pavonazzi, e frangia di oro. Lì dirimpetto nel secondo pilastro osservasi una figura a fresco del buon ladrone, che si troverà in pochi luoghi così dipinto all’antica, avendolo il pittore non solamente confitto in Croce coi chiodi, ma legate le gambe con funi, acciocché non si confondesse con Cristo Gesù, e così notò il Molano essere stata la Chiesa consueta di fare . Questa pittura però fu quì collocata per la seguente cagione, notata 300 anni sono nei Libri della Compagnia della Croce al Tempio, e ricopiata da Vincenzio del Corno Gentiluomo Fiorentino amatore delle cose antiche nei suoi Ricordi, e leggesi negli Spogli di Leopoldo del Migliore, come segue “1361. N. N. condannato alla forca, era di Famiglia più che mediocremente civile; poche ore prima di esser condotto al pratello, parlò ad un Fratello della Compagnia dei Neri solita ad assistere queo da doversene fare pubblico spettacolo, e dissegli come in sua casa appiè del Ponte Vecchio aveva in un cassòne riposta una somma di danaro, e che la sua intenzione era di voler far dipingere in Or S. Michele al pilastro vicino all’Oratorio una figura del buon ladrone, acciò pregasse Dio, che gli usasse in quel breve respiro quella misericordia, che rese lui beato. Chi eseguì ii Legato ha scritto questo ricordo“, Questa Immagine fu dipinta da Iacopo Landini da Prato Vecchio detto il Cafentino, di lui essendo quasi tutte Ie altre, toltene alcune poche, di cui faremo qui menzione. Di Iacopo adunque è la volta, ove rappresentò sedici tra Patriarchi e Profeti, i quali posano sur’un campo di azzurro oltramarino, colore che costò assai, per la fresca invenzione ritrovata di estrarlo dalle preziose pietre di lapislazzuli; né mancarono Cittadini statuali di quei tempi, che ne mormorarono , paruta loro una spesa buttata , anzi uno strapazzo del danaro della Santissima Immagine: ma questo parlare ardito dispiacque tanto al popolo, che ne volle, dice il Cambi, una pubblica sodisfazione all’onore oltraggiato di Maria con la prigionia di uno di casa Foraboschi. E tornando a Iacopo di Casentino, suoi sono parimente i moltissimi Santi dipinti l’un sopra l’altro negli archi, tra un pilastro e l’altro , e nelle facce dei 16 pilastri, fuori che alquanti pochi, come il S. Bartolommeo lavoro finissimo di mano di Lorenzo di Credi, e al secondo pilastro in un ovato S. Maria Maddalena portata in Cielo dagli Àngioli di mano di Andrea del Sarto; siccome il S. Stèfano tra le due porte fu fatto dal Poppi, il quale fece ancora le due tavole, che sono in Coro, di Cristo, e di S. Giova Batista; dei Sogliani è il S. Martino rimpetto a S. Stefano, e suo credesì il S. Agostino in mezzo del Coro, benchè vi sia chi lo giudica dell’ AIbertinelli. Sotto l’organo Agnolo Gaddi pittore in quei tempi di grido rappresentò alla parete Cristo, che disputa in mezzo ai Dottori. Né io voglio tralasciare di riferire ciò che il Dottor Brocchi rammenta essere accaduto alla figura di S. Verdiana, la quale si vede al pilastro della cantonata di questa Chiesa riguardante il Mezzodì accanto alla immagine di S. Lucia. Essendo ella per l’antichità assai guasta fu fatta rifiorire nei nostri tempi, ma con grande discapito della Istoria, posciachè il Pittore scancellò la iscrizione, che vi era sotto scritta a caratteri gotici, e quello, che fu più strano, alla Santa mutato si vede l’abito di secolare , che aveva, in tonaca Religiosa. Considerabile poi è la Cappella di S. Anna erettavi a spese del Comune dalla banda di Tramontana, per dovervisi commemorare in perpetuo l’atto di un’azione la più importante, che accader possa in una Repubblica libera , che fu la cacciata del Tiranno Duca di Atene, ed occupator violento del Dominio Fiorentino, seguita, giusta tutti gli Scrittori, nei 26, Luglio del 1343 giorno di Sant’Anna, la quale venne per questa grazia onorata fra i Protettori principali col titolo di Propitia , &amp;amp; F. utrix libertatis Civitatis Florentina; e però, come apparisce alle Riformagioni Lib. B. del 1349 si fece il Decreto della Signorsa di spendere tremila fiorini di oro per la erezione in Or S. Michele di una Cappella ridotta nel 1526 a miglior ordine dai Capitani, veggendosi sull’Altare isolato la Santa figurata in marmo bianco pìù alta del vivo in atto di tenere in collo la Vergine Maria, che porta in seno il Bambino Gesù, opera lodatissima di Francesco da S. Gallo. A 26 di Luglio la Signoria v’interveniva ogni anno a offerta con tutte le Capitudini delle Arti, si correva un palio, ed altre cose di somma allegrezza facevansi in quel giorno, ordinate nello Statuto fatto nel 1343 ai 28 di Ottobre con questa bella introduzione di parole : Pro houore Reip. &amp;amp; ad perpetuam memoriam libertatis Civitatis Florentia, &amp;amp; ut Civium mentibus sit infixum, qualiter die S. Anna de mense Iulii Populus Flor per Dei gratiam, &amp;amp; virtutem bonorum, a Tyrannide Ducis Atbernarum liberatus &amp;amp;c. Ed in una tavola della Chiesa leggesi, che in questa Festa si espone la Reliquia della Santa, che si dà a baciare alla Centuria dei Fratelli, e Sorelle della Santissima Trinità. Passandosi ora ad altra Cappella, è d’uopo, che io mi faccia a riferire quel tanto, che ho promedso nell’antecedente Lezione, parlando della nicchia degli Speziali, perchè una Madonna a sedere col Figlio in collo standovi collocata, e lavorata già da Simone da Fiesole allievo del Brunellesco, fu trasferita in Chiesa , e messa ad una delle due porte grandi chiusa per formarne una Cappella; e la cagione di ciò fu la seguente. Nell’anno 1628 il popolo a voce di parecchi, che asserivano con giuramento di aver veduta questa Statua muovere, e battere gli occhi, corse in grandissimo numero, ed in tanta folla di giorno, e di notte, che sì ebbe prima a sbarrar le strade per isfuggire il tumulto, gridando ognuno misericordia, che fu uno di quei preludi della peste, che venne dipoi a Firenze nel 1630. Poscia per deviare la gente devota, che non si sarebbe mai partita di lì, si pigliò dal Granduca Ferdinando espediente di trasferirla dentro. Del miracoloso avvenimento se ne fece processo per ordine dell’Arcivescovo Alessandro Marzimedici, ed uno dei disaminati, che depose di aver veduta la Statua aprire e serrare più volte gli occhi, fu il Canonico Cavaliere Giovanni Guidacci. A questa figura di Nostra Donna stando fuori nella sua nicchia accadde un altro caso in tempo di Repubblica, che in due versi inciso appiè del marmo anche in oggi si legge, e fu che un Marrano Giudeo di bel giorno senza tema di esser veduto la percosse con un ferro, ma il far ciò, e il vederlo morto, strascinato fu tutto un tempo; e questo sacrilego fatto viene anche scritto da Forese dà Ribatta nei Libri di sue Ricordanze, nelle quali vien di più a questo particolare, che il corpo di costui fosse buttato per ultimo vilipendio nella fogna di S. Stefano. E Ie parole intagliate nella base del marmo per memoria di questo fatto sono le qui appresso: “Hanc ferro effigiem petiit ludeus, &amp;amp; Index Ipse fibi vulgo dilaniatus obit MccccLxxXXlII.” E conciosìacosachè in queste Lezioni si abbia frequentemente rammentato il titolo di Or S. Michele , non sia grave a chi legge , che io riporti l’origine di questo nome, come contenente non ispregevoli notizie, e specialmente dell’antichità, lo che non so se veramente lo dicano le Istorie, che di O. S. M. favellano: e però dispensandomi dall’esaminare il dubbio, se quivi già dal 750 vi fosse un’Oratorio dedicato al Santo Arcangelo, per camminare sul sicuro con documenti autorevoli, dirò primieramente, che poco dopo il mille vi era una Chiesa Parrocchiale, la quale contigua ad un Orto fu detta San Michele in Orto , venerabile per vero dire più di ogni altra, che ne fosse in Firenze con somigliante titolo, situata ella essendo nel più nobilitato luogo della Città; e che fosse Parrocchia è verità assai chiara dagli Strumenti antichissimi, che la dichiarano tale, come in un Testamento nell’Archivio di Badia n. 25. tra i Testimoni leggesi: Filippus Pieri Ranerii pop. S. Michaelis in orto 1100. Ed in molti contratti vetusti della famiglia dei Mozzi quì abitanti innanzi che passassero di là di Arno a S. Gregorio , trovansi accennati Populi San Michele in Orto. Come ella poi passasse ai Monaci Cisterciensi della Badia di S. Silvestro di Nonantola, non mi sono avvenuto sin qui a trovarlo: il vero si è, che Papa Innocenzio III. in una sua Bolla data in Viterbo nel 1209 già esistente presso le Monache del Paradiso, indicata dal Migliore a pag 540 conferma a detti Monaci con molte altre Chiese questa ancora di S. Michele: Ecclesias S. Felicis, S. Martini in Mamma, &amp;amp; S. Michaelis intus Flor. La Repubblica poscia per suoi antichi diritti ne dovette riassumere il padronato, levandolo ai Cisterciensi; per la qual cosa seguì qualche disgusto con Roma, trovandosi alle Riformagioni una lettera del 1249. di Papa Innocenzio IV veduta dal Migliore, nella quale esortasi la Repubblica a render la Chiesa alla Badia di Nonantola, insieme col Castello di S. Martino. E quali fossero gli effetti di questa esortazione si può ravvisare dalle risoluzioni della Repubblica. Conciosiachè avendo la Signoria bisogno di una piazza per la vendita del grano, e di stanzoni per conservarlo, e considerato questo luogo molto opportuno, ne fece spianare la Chiesa, ordinando di darsi principio ad una Loggia, della quale parla il Migliore a pagina 530 così : “Col disegno di Arnolfo Panno 1284 che si era fondata sopra l’antica Chiesa di S. Michele.” Ma perchè non si perdesse la memoria di Chiesa così antica, debbo qui notare, come nello stesso tempo volle la Repubblica, che Arnolfo ne fabbricasse un’altra rimpetto alla nuova Loggia ; che è l’Oratorio presente, detto S Michele vecchio, ma in oggi S. Carlo per la cagione seguente. Si era di fresco canonizzato S. Carlo da Paolo. E penetratasene la fama di sua santità per ogni dove, con riempiersi di divozione al Santo le Città principali, e massimamente Firenze, che in materia di Religione fu sempre mai ferventissima, quando il Cardinale Federigo Borromei Arcivescovo di Milano ricordevole dell’antico passaggio da questo Stato a quello di Milano, che fecero i Borromei, e del soggiorno fatto in questa Città dal Santo , volle, che delle Reliquie, le prime che fossero portate fuori di Milano, si mandassero a Firenze, che furono un gran pezzo della Camicia , ch’egli aveva addosso quando morì, e del suo sangue raccolto in una spugna sparato che fu. La solennità nel riceverle fu grandissima al pari della già conceputa divozione nel popolo, ma prevedendosi, che il luogo, ove queste si dovealo collocare sarebbe stato anguito assai per celebrarvi la sacra traslazione, e Cosimo II. volendo anch’egli dare un segno al suo solito di divozione, e grato mostrarsi alle cortesi offerte del Cardinale, l’Altezza sua sottoscrisse un Memoriale alla Compagnia dei Lombardi, cui erano esse Reliquie dirette , concedendo ai Fratelli l’oratorio di San Michele, come luogo più capace della Chiesa di S. Miniato tra le Torri, ove allora la Compagnia si ragunava, trasferitavi già da S. Pier del Murrone, oggi detto S. Giovannino in Via di S. Gallo, e volle Sua Altezza, che i Capitani di Or S. Michele, ai quali spettava il dominio dell’Oratorio, ne facessero la donazione per Decreto del 1616 contenente alcune condizioni, cioè di non mai la Compagnia mettervi alcuna sua Arme, e dell’onorificenza annua di un censo di cera da darsegli nel giorno di S. Michele. Allora fu levata dall’Altar Maggiore la tavola antichissima di Buonamico Bufalmacco rappresentante un Cristo morto, venendo trasferita sulla porta al di dentro, e fu collocata in suo luogo la tavola di Matteo Roselli, ove è S. Carlo vestito da Cardinale in una gloria figurata lucida, e risplendente con molti Angioli attorno, e fra essi nel primo luogo S. Michele con le sue insegne, secondo i patti, sperando così i Capitani di conservare vivo il titolo di S. Michele, prevedendosi , come è seguito, che la nuova venerazione a S. Carlo aveva a far dimenticare l’Oratorio di S. Michele, il quale è stato illustrato da Papa Alessandro VII nell’anno nono del suo pontificato di una perpetua Indulgenza per i Fratelli nella Festa di S. Carlo. La Tribuna dell’Altar grande, come dimostra l’Arme di una Colonna seminata di Vai affissa nell’arco con licenza dei Capitani, era stata in antico eretta dai Pilli Famiglia Consolare, della quale parla Dante nel Canto. del Paradiso: grande era già la Colonna del Vajo. E nelle Scritture di Or S. Michele si legge “Altar Maggiore dell’Oratorio di S. Michele fatto in esecuzione del Testamento di Messer Bindo dei Pilli nell’anno 1376.” Ed a man manca entrando è osservabile una Tavola di Fabbrizio Boschi, avendo egli in essa effigiata con bel disegno e vivacità di colori la presentazione di Cristo al Tempio. Nell’Architrave della porta in segno del Padronato dei Capitani vedesi scolpita Ia loro divisa a caratteri di bronzo dorato, che sono le tre lettere O.S.M. E tornando finalmente alla Loggia di Or. S. Michele, che si disse sostenere con 16 pilastri la gran torre fatta per il grano, e che poscia dal Granduca Cosimo I. giudicata per luogo atto a poter salvare le scritture dal fuoco, e dall’acqua fu destinata per Archivio Generale non posso tralasciare le lodi, che ne derivarono alla gloriosa memoria di questo Principe. Si pubblicò adunque una medaglia coll’effigie del Granduca, ed il suo nome; e nel rovescio la Porta dell’Archivio aperta con molti libri in essa fìgurati per Protocolli con corona ai Frontespizio, e lettere attorno, che dicevano: Publica Fidei. Evvi ancora a caratteri di oro una Iscrizione sulla Porta dell’Archivio situata in Calimala, e dice: “ARCHIVIVM HOC PERPETVITATI PVBLICORVM MONIMENTORVM CONSERVANDAE DICATVM SERENISS COSMVS MED. EREXIT. QVAMPRIMVM MAGNVS DVX HETRVRIAE SALVTATVS REGIAQVE corona insignitvs est mdlxix.” E similmente alla Porta, che mette nello Stanzone delle Scritture, dove non si ammettono se non i Ministri senza lume, e senza fuoco, si legge pure a lettere indorate. “FIDEI PVBLTCAE SERENIS.S. COSMVS MED. MAGNVS DVX ETRVRIAE EREXIT KAL. MARTIIS MDLXIX.” E io quando mi credeva di avere qui terminato le mie Memorie Istoriche intorno ad Or S. Michele, debbo a queste arrogere una indispensabile notizia, senza la quale chi legge potrebbe prendere un’equivoco sopra gli Ufiziali di Or San Michele. Conciosiachè due Magistrati eranvi di simigliante appellazione, al primo dei quali spettava la cura di detta Piazza, o Loggia circa la vendita del grano, e delle biade , i quali durarono a cosi chiamarsi sino a tanto, che i Signori non fecero chiuderla la loggia mutata avendola in Chiesa, ed altrove trasferito il pubblico granaio; Al secondo Magistrato apparteneva il buon governo della Compagnia, e dell’Oratorio della Madonna di Or S. Michele, con un ampla iurisdizione sopra i beni donati alla Santissima Immagine. E questa differenza di ufizi apparisce nella Carnera Fiscale al Libro segnato 1344 contenente diverse scritture, biglietti, e cedole dei Priori al Podestà di Firenze, nel qual libro sotto il dì 27 di Febbraio leggonsi estratti per Ufiziali della loggia del grano di Or. S. Michele i seguenti: Filippus Rochi de Capponibus, Zenobius Lapi Risaliti, Dominicus Rizzini Fagioli, &amp;amp; Mattheus Roselli Pictor Officiales extracti pro Comuni Flor. ad Officium Platea O. Si M. pro termino, &amp;amp; tempore quatuor mensium. E con tale documento spiacemi di dover notare su questo proposito lo sbaglio del chiarissimo Leopoldo del Migliore alla pagina 369 della sua Firenze Illustrata, nella quale Egli scrisse, che il suddetto Matteo da Rosello fu dei Capitani della Madonna di Or S. Michele, nel Ruolo dei quali, che và copiato nelle mani di più studiosi, non si vede mai il detto Matteo. Ma se questi non trovasi al numero dei Capitani della Madonna, meritava però di essere messo da Giorgio Vasari nel numero dei Pittori, così denominato nella sopra riferita elezione. E tra le opere di lui è considerata la dipintura dell’Inferno, che aveva fatto nella Chiesa di S. Michele dei Visdomini giusta il suddetto Leopoldo del Migliore alla detta Pagina, dove dice come segue “Dipinti al naturale erano in 5, quello inferno molti uomini tristi di quella età, fra quali il Duca di Atene coi suoi seguaci, come traditori della Signoria dì Firenze nel più caro che è la libertà, o ladri, !e male lingue, e quei che si erano mostrati contrari al pubblico interesse, che chi gli aveva conosciuti diceva, quello è il tale, così bene vi erano state portate le somiglianze loro dal naturale: passò per proverbio finché la pittura stette in piedi, il dirsi per Firenze, gli è ritratto in S. Michele, e tanto basti. Era questo lavoro stato fatto da Matteo di “Roffello Pittore antico e civile.” Ma tornando ai Capitani della Madonna di O. S. M. non debbo tralasciar di avvertire, come questi sono stati pure aboliti, avendo il Nostro Imperatore dara la soprintendenza del Sacro Tempio ad un solo Gentiluomo, il quale presentemente è ii Sig. Domenico Baldigiani. E per modo di appendice rammenterò quì la Ven. Congrega dei Preti detta della Visitazione, la quale riconosce il suo principio nel 1494. a dì 24. di Febbraio da alcuni Sacerdoti della Collegiata di Or S. Michele, e questa Congrega composta di 40 Preti senza più si aduna nella Chiesa di S. Michele in Palchetto, dove sulla porta leggesi il seguente titolo. “CONGREGATIO VISITATIONIS PRESBYTERORVM.”",

THE BIGALLO AND THE COMPAGNIA DELLA MISERICORDIA Documents The Building and its Decorations A.S.F., Carte Strozziane, Magliabecchiana, XXXVII, cod. 300, 132 (Poggi, “Bigallo,” 194, n. 1; Saalman, The Bigallo, 44, n. 1). A record transcribed by Senator Carlo Strozzi about the purchase of a building across from the Baptistery of S. Giovanni. The buyers were members of the confraternity of the Misericordia and the seller was Baldinaccio Adimari, an aristocrat whose family owned most of the buildings just south of the Piazza del Duomo, along the road that connected the cathedral to the Piazza della Signoria by the river. “1321. Libro della Compagnia della Misericordia dove sono notati tutti quelli che aiutorno comperare la casa dirimpetto alla porta del Battesimo di S. Giovanni, comperata da Baldinaccio Adimari, dove hoggi si ragunano i capitani della Misericorida. 1321 et 1322 si fece la detta compera.” A.S.F., Bigallo, II, 1, 26r. September 16, 1351 (Poggi, “Bigallo,” 225; Saalman, The Bigallo, 44-45, n. 2). A neighbor, Giovanni degli Albizzi Pellegrini, bequeaths to the confraternity a house that he owns on the Corso degli Adimari (running south from the Piazza del Duomo to the Piazza della Signoria), along with a modest monetary gift for the Misericordia. Giovanni refers to himself as a member of the parish of S. Cristofori, the neighborhood just to the west of the Baptistery and the Bishop’s Palace: in one sentence, a Florentine refers to himself by his family name and lineage, neighborhood and street name, parish church, and charitable interest. “1351, 16 Settembre. Item dicta die Iohannes Albizi Pellegrini populi S. Cristofori obtulit se et domum suam positam super canto Cursus de Adimaribus societati nostrae et fuit factus familiaris perpetuus (cum certis pactis) cum salario 8 lib. fp. quolibet mense ….” A.S.F., Bigallo, II, 1, 28r. January 28 1352 (Poggi, “Bigallo,” 226; Saalman, The Bigallo, 45, n.3). A notary, together with witnesses that include a canon named Don Bartolo, describes the location and general size of the building that now houses the confraternity of the Misericordia. Located on the corner where the Corso degli Adimari meets the Piazza del Duomo (here called the Piazza S. Giovanni, or the “plateae s. Iohannis”), the structure extends some 10 braccia, or roughly 20 feet (about 6 meters). “… Item die 28 Ianuari magister Iohannes ser Pieri, mensurator Communis, et magister Thomasus Iacobi Passerae, magister communis, dederunt, praesentibus domino Bartolo canonico maioris ecclesiae flor. et aliis presbiteris et pluribus vicinis, situm edificando oratorium super canto plateae s. Iohannis capiendo braccia 10 terreni vel circa, incipiendo ex latere viae de Adimaribus iuxta columpnam domus contiguae dicto hedificio et ita posse fieri declaraverunt et rogaverunt per me notarium infrascriptum.” A.S.F., Bigallo, II, 2, 19r. December 20, 1359 (Poggi, “Bigallo,” 227; Saalman, The Bigallo, 45, n. 4). The confraternity, or “compagnia” (company), designates two of its members–Amaretto and Francesco–to serve as “operai,” or overseers of the work about to be completed on the building. These volunteers will be expected to consult with the masons as construction commences and continues, and they will confer with the confraternity to describe the progress made and articulate the challenges that face them. Of note is the language used in this entry: as it serves as an internal document and not as an official legal contract, the vernacular Italian of everyday use has been employed. But when transactions occur–whether they be in the forms of wills, purchases, or gifts (see the donation of property from Giovanni degli Albizzi to the confraternity, noted above in 1351)–professional notaries will be called upon to draft the agreement in Latin, the language of the Church and the language of the commune, so that it’s binding in the eyes of both judicial systems. “…. Item elexoro e chiamarono, per loro e per la detta compagnia, operai governatori e fabricatori del laborio dell’oratorio, con balia di potere allogare i lavorio che si dee fare delle volte e dell’altro lavorio che intorno accio bisogna di fare a quelle persone che alloro piacera e per quel tempo e termine e con quel salaro e mercede che alloro piacera, voglendo che il detto mandato duri finito l’ofitio de detti Amaretto e Francesco capitani insino che il detto lavorio sia finito e compiuto.” A.S.F., Bigallo, II, 2, 27r. March 23, 1359 (1360) (Poggi, “Bigallo,” 227-28; Saalman, The Bigallo, 46, n. 5a). The building is constructed! A carpenter, or “tavoliere,” named Leonardo Bartolini has overseen an expensive project to decorate the building–it has cost the confraternity 100 gold florins, a healthy sum in 1360, and has been delivered to the craftsman by Matteo Portinari, a “camarlingo” who has been designated by the company’s members as the official responsible for taking care of business transactions for them. This project seems to postdate an earlier one that had resulted in the carving and installation of a sculptural program in marble of the Virgin Mary and Angels by Alberto Arnoldi that still exists in the Museo del Bigallo. Located on the ground floor and facing out toward the Corso degli Adimari, the image could have been seen by all passersby on the street as they moved to or from the piazza. The date of the document, March 23, indicates that this is a year-end appraisal of work: the Florentine’s marked the start of each new year on March 25, the feast of the Annunciation of the Virgin (yes, nine months to the day before the Nativity of Christ), which in turn represented to them the beginning of a new era in history. “…. In prima avuto consideratione alla constructione dell’oratorio e che bisogna e aconciare luogho dove le figure di marmo di nostra Donna e degl’agnoli, le quali si fanno e lavorano, si ponghano, e altre chose bisognia intorno al detto oratorio fare, e voglendo intorno accio provedere, deliberarono e stantiarono che Mattheo Portinari, camarlingho della detta compagnia, dea e paghi a Leonardo Bartolini tavoliere e a compagni fior. 100 d’oro, i quali il detto Leonardo debbia ispendere nel lavorio del detto oratorio e per quello fare adornare e cresciere.” A.S.F., Bigallo, II, 2, 29v. June 5, 1360 (Poggi, “Bigallo,” 227-28; Saalman, The Bigallo, 46, n. 5b). Leonardo Bartolini continues to oversee work on the building, while Matteo Portinari continues to pay him. A man named Francesco Salvini has joined the crew and is compensated for his work. “Item deliberarano estantiavarono che Leonardo Bartolini dea e paghi a Francesco Salvini pro parte di pagamento de lavorio che deono fare aloratorio f. xiii d’oro fecero labolletta.” A.S.F., Bigallo, II, 2, 31r. August 26, 1360 (Poggi, “Bigallo,” 227-28; Saalman, The Bigallo, 46, n. 5c). In the summer months, stone masons come into the project, again sub contracted by Leonardo Bartolini. They receive a hefty sum of 60 gold florins for their work. “Item deliberarono che Leonardo Bartolini de somma a lui depositata dea e paghi a Matteo Portinari Camarlingho della detta compagnia per ispendere dare e paghare a maestri in pietre calcine erea f. LX d’oro e di cio fecero la bolletta in due partite.” A.S.F., Bigallo, II, 2, 37r. June 30, 1361 (Poggi, “Bigallo,” 228; Saalman, The Bigallo, 46, n. 6). Now that construction on the addition to the building along the Corso degli Adimari has been completed, a man named Bartolomeo paints the roof. Bartolomeo received the equivalent of about 1 1/5 gold florins for his work (as there were roughly 40 lire to the florin): but, as he was a day laborer and had a number of inexpensive items he needed to purchase for his profession, he preferred to take his payment in smaller denominations of silver lire, soldi, and denari Note that Bartolomeo’s profession is listed as “dipintore,” the same word used for those who painted figures on altarpieces, frescoes, and manuscript pages. The latter were not yet referred to as “artists.” “…. In prima statiarono che il camarlingho paghi a Bartolomeo dipintore l. 62 s. 3 d. 6, i quali dee avere per dipintura del tetto de l’oratorio.” A.S.F., Bigallo, II, 3, 27v. July 5, 1386 (Poggi, “Bigallo,” 229; Saalman, The Bigallo, 46, n. 7a). Niccolo di Pietro Gerini and Ambrogio di Baldese–two painters, or “dipintori”–receive 17 gold florins for completing a fresco on the façade of the original building that then, as now, faced the Baptistery of S. Giovanni The fresco illustrates one of the many charitable duties of the confraternity–the receipt, care, and return of children deposited there by parents either unable or unwilling to care for them. The painting could be seen by anyone and everyone standing at the south portal of the Baptistery (where a portion of the ritual of baptism was performed, with infants, parents, godparents, and friends would participate) or walking past the Bigallo on their way to or from work, social events, or shopping. The two painters worked together on a number of projects, but Gerini in particular became a favorite of Florentine patrons at the end of the fourteenth century. His works adorned altars and interior spaces of the Confraternity of the Pilgrims in S. Maria Novella, the ___ chapel in S. Croce, the guild church of Orsanmichele, and the monastery of S. Maria degli Angeli. Largely overlooked by historians of early Renaissance art, his popularity at the turn of the fifteenth century speaks to the public taste for imagery just before the arrival in Florence of the transformative artist named Masaccio. “A Nicholo di Piero e Ambrogio di Baldese dipintori a di 22 di Giugno per resto del lavorio della dipintura della faccia dinanzi della casa della Misericordia, fior. 17 d’oro.” A.S.F., Bigallo, II, 3, 90r. November 21, 1392 (Poggi, “Bigallo,” 228; Saalman, The Bigallo, 46, n. 7b). Ambrogio di Baldese paints a room in the Misericordia–here referred to as the “domus” (or home) used by the officers (“capitani”) of the confraternity. This was probably the so-called “Sala d’Udienza,” or Audience Hall, where decisions large and small were discussed by the company’s leaders. The modest sum of 8 lire, 6 soldi delivered to the painter suggests that this payment represented either a small portion of a larger original total agreed upon earlier or, conversely, that the image Ambrogio produced in the Audience Hall was very small and not terribly time consuming. “Ambroxio Baldesis pictori pro expensis pro reactando picturam domus misericordiae in qua congregantur capitanei tam pro expensis factis per eum quam pro suo labore in totum l.8, s. 6.” 1. Senator Carlo Strozzi’s transcript of a document concerning the acquisition of the old residence building opposite San Giovanni in 1321-22. 1321.

Giuseppe Richa’s description of the Bigallo residence in 1758 E pero consideriamo una pittura grande sopra il Portone al di fuori dipinta a fresco rappresentante in varie, e belle attitudini, dove molti Fanciulli smarriti, e dove delle Madri chi afflitta per la perdita dal figlio, e chi in aria allegra per vederselo restituire da’ Capitani del Bigallo, veggendosi in tale dipintura molte Case, e Torri all’uso di que’tempi, cioe del 1444 come travosi notato al liv. x pag. 8 nell’Archivio del medesimo Bigallo, dove si legge anche il nome del Pittore e dice, 1444. 1 Iunii Capitanei S. Marie Virginis, &amp;amp; Misericordie del Bigallo &amp;amp;c. ordinano pagarsi diversi obblighi del loro Spedale &amp;amp;c. Item Piero Chellino Pictori pro resto totius sue Picture facte in Domo habitationis Capitaneorum in facie exteriori. Nell andito dell’Udienza sonovi alquante Pitture vetuste, come quelle che occupano tutta la parete addirimpetto alla Porta del Magistrato, ma cosi annerite, e guaste, che non e sperabile l’arrivare ad intenderle: sul piano della scala, che con due braccia conduce al piano superiore, vedesi un Cristo ritto nel Sepolcro, colle braccia aperte, tenente nel senno una moltitudine di gente per esprimere la Misericordia, e sotto due Cartelli di caratteri gottici, che dicono: O volgente…..XXI. E a manritta di questa porta viene una parimente antichissima pittura a fresco, ed una Figura gigantesca della Misericordia espressa in una Persona ammantata di Piviale con Mitra tonda in capo, e Stolone fina ai piedi, nella quale Stola veggonsi alcuni ovati, in cui sono effigiate le Opere della Misericordia con lettere longobarde. Questa figura sta in aria in atto maestoso di padrona, sopra a Firenze dipintale sotto con Popolo inginocchioni, e chi bramasse sapere qual fosse il secondo Cerchio della Citta, lo veda quivi delineato. Il Pittore di questa Tavola spiego la sua idea con le seguenti lettere mezze gottiche, ma rifiorite sull’antiche, e dichono: OMNIS MISERICORDIA FACIET LOCVM VNICVIQVE SECVNDVM MERITVM OPERVM SVORVM, ET SECVNDVM INTELLECTVM PEREGRINATIONIS ILLIVS ANNO MCCCLII. Uscendo da questra loggetta a man destra sono nel muro numero sei arpioni alti dal piano degli scalini due in tre braccia, de’ quali s’ha certa tradizione, che serevissero per attaccarvi la Cattedra, quando San Pier Martire predicava in sue questa Piazza; della qual cosa non avendo altra autenticazione, che il detto di qualche Persona antica, mi bastera di averlo qui accennato, lasciando a ciascuno giudicare come gli piace. E sulla Porta dell’Udienza, oltre l’arme de’Granduchi evvi un Cartello contenente a caratteri d’oro queste lettere; SERENISS. COSMO MAGNO D. HETRURIAE | XII. VIRI CUM CERTIS PIETATIS MINISTERIIS | ET PUERIS DERELICTIS CUM ALIQUA ECCLESIAST. | DIGNI PERSONA COLLGENDIS ET CURANDIS PRAEFECTI. But let us consider a grand picture over the Gate on the outside painted in fresco representing in various, and beautiful attitudes, where many lost children, and where the mothers who were afflicted by the loss of the child, and who in happy air to see them returned from the Captains of the Bigallo, seeing in this painting many Houses, and Towers to the use of those times, that is of 1444 as noted in book X page 8 in the Archive of the same Bigallo, where one reads also the name of the Painter and say, 1444. 1 June Captains of Saint Virgin Mary, &amp;amp; Misericordia del Bigallo [&amp;amp;c.] 22. P. Landini’s description of the oratory and residence (first published 1779) with notes by P. Pillori (published 1845) Pp. 16-17: Parimente in detto oratorio ad uso e comodo di sagrestia vi e annessa una stanza di lunghezza braccia otto, e di larghezza braccia sei, che aveva l’ingresso in un atrio ben grande dell ufizio, che teneva il magistrato de’ sigg. capitani del Bigallo, prima che fosse quello nell’anno 1777 a nuova forma ridotto. Pp. 16-17: Likewise in the said oratory for use and convenience of the sacristy [it?] has a room eight braccia long, and in width six braccia, which had the entrance to a great atrium of the office, which was held by the magistrate of the Lord Capitains of the Bigallo, before that was in the year 1777 in a new, reduced form. Pillori, p. 17 no. 1: I fratelli della compagnia della Misericordia acquistarono da Baldinaccio Adimari nel 1340 alcune case, e da queste, oltre la residenza pe’ capitani, levarono una stanza per use di sagrestia, che ora piu non esiste. Pillori, p. 17 no. 1: The brothers of the Company of the Misericordia acquired from Baldinaccio Adimari in 1340 some houses, and of these, beside the residence [pe’] captains, they raised a room for use of the sacresty, that now no longer exists. P. 17: Presentemente la comunicazione della sopredetta sagrestia, la quale fu comprata da Baldinaccio Adimari, si vede essere remasta in un piccolo andito, vicino ad un principio di scala di sette scalini che introduce a due scale, con branche di ferro, e davanti alla medesima, ben conservato, si vede espresso in una pittura sul legno un Cristo ritto nel sepolcro con le braccia apere che tiene nel seno una moltitudine di gente, per esprimere la Misericordia, e sotto due cartelli di caratteri gotici, che dicono… P. 17 Presently the communication of the above mentioned sacristy, which was bought from Baldinaccio Adimari, [seen to be remaining in a small step], near to a [principle] of stairs of seven steps that lead to two stairs, with iron railings, and in front of the same, well-conserved, one sees expressed in a picture on wood a Christ [straight?] in the tomb with open arms that keep to his bosom a multitude of people, to express the Misericordia, and underneath two signs of Gothic characters, that say… P. 21: Si vedevano al pubblico esposte sopra il portone al di fuori, che conduceva in detto luogo alcune pitture dipinte a fresco l’anno 1444 rappresentanti in varie attitudini alcuni fanciulli smarriti, e fra essi alcune madri afflitte per la perdita dei loro figliuoli, ed altre in aria allegra per vederseli restituire dai capitani; e benche consumate dal tempo vi si vedono alcune case, e torri all’uso di quei tempi. Trovasi di tale pittura descritto l’autore nell’archivio del commissariato nel lib. X alla pag. 8, ove si legge PRIMO IUNII PETRO CHELLINIO PICTORI PRO RESTO TOTIUS PICTURAE FACTA IN DOMO HABITATIONIS CAPITANORUM IN FACIE EXTERIORI. Ma tutte queste pitture dal presente commissario in occasione della nuova fabbrica, fatta per commissario in occasione della nuova fabbrica, fatta per miglio comodita de’ poveri abbandonati con somma attenzione e diligenza, e accio non si perdesse del tutto tal memoria, nel mese di settembre dell’anno 1777 furono in poco tempo, per mezzo di maestro Teobaldo Bercilli, fatte segare in due pezzi, che trasportati hanno poi servito per chiudere l’atrio, e farvi una nuova stanza, che prima metteva nell’ufizio de’ predetti sigg. capitani; nella quale sono state unite altre pitture e memorie antiche esprimenti molte opere del glorioso S. Pier Martire, ed una figura rappresentante la Misericordia. Nel mese di dicembre di detto anno, dopo che fu ultimata la nuova fabbrica del prenominato sig. commissario fu ordinato che per mano di Santi Pacini fossero ripulite tutte; come pure diciotto quadri di altezza, e larghezza di braccia uno e un sesto, dodici de’ quali restano dentro la sopradetto stanza, e sei in altro luogo interno, degni di ogni bellezza, per l’attenzione usata dal detto professore. P. 21: One saw in the public place above the doorway to the outisde, which [led?] in the said place some pictures painted in fresco in the year 1444 representing in various attitudes some lost children, and between these some mothers afflicted by the loss of their children, and others [in the air?] happy to see them restored by the captains; and although consumed by time you see some houses, and towers in the use of those times. One finds these pictures described by the author in the Archive of the Commissariato in book X page 8, where one reads “FIRST OF JUNE PIETRO CELLINI PAINTER FOR ALL THE PICTURES DONE IN THE LIVING QUARTERS OF THE CAPTAIN AND THE EXTERIOR.” But all these pictures from the present commissario because of the new work, done for the Pillori, p. 22 n. 1, inscription under “Fanciulli Smarriti” fragment: FLORENTINI ORPHANOTROPHI MONVMENTVM | EXTERNAE AEDIS HVIVSCE PARIETI | GRAPHICE A VETERIBVS CONSIGNATVM | HAC IN NVPERRIMA EIVSMET RESTAVRATIONE | ARTE TRANSLATVM ANNO MDCCLXXVII | PETRO LEOPOLDO I ARCHID. AVST. | NEC NON MAG. ETR. DUC. | PIE CLEMENTER QVE FAVENTE Pillori, p. 22 n. 1, inscription under “Fanciulli Smarriti” fragment: Pillori, p. 22 n. 2: Anche tutte queste pitture restano ora nella stanza del cassiere del Bigallo. Quelle esprimenti alcuni fatti della vita di S. Pier Martire sono molto annerite e guaste, e si scorgono nella parete dirimpetto alla porta, che introduceva un tempo alla residenza del magistrato, sulla quale tuttora si vedono le armi della Misericordia e del Bigallo in un solo scudo ridotte. Pillori p. 22 n. 2: Also all these pictures remain now in the room of the [cashier] of the Bigallo. Those exprerssing some done of the life of Saint Peter Martyr are very blackened and [faulty], and they [notice?] on the wall opposite the gate, which once introduced to the residence of the magistrate, on which still they see the arms of the Misericordia and of the Bigallo in one reduced shield. Pp. 37-39: … una pittura antica esprimente la Misericordia, la quale ora resta in una nuova stanza del commissariato del Bigallo. Questa stanza fu tutta dipinta nel mese di novembre dell’anno 1777 da Francesco Panaiotti, ed ora serve per uso del detto sig. commissario fu fatta ripulire da Santi Pacini insieme con gli altri diciotto quadri esistenti in parte nella medesima stanza; di altezza braccia uno e un sesto, esprimenti le piu stupende azioni di S. Pier Martire… Pp. 37-39: … an old picture displaying the Misericordia, which now rests in a new room of the [commissariato] of the Bigallo. This room was all painted in the month of November in the year 1777 by Francesco Panaiotti, and now serves for the use of the aforementioned Sig. Commissario was done re-cleaned by Santi Pacini together with the other eighteen paintings Pillori, p. 39 n. 1: Tutte queste pitture molto ben conservate si vedono tuttora nella stanza del cassiere del Bigallo: le dodici esprimenti le azioni di S. Pier Martire sono un poco annerite e guaste… Il Becchi nel suo illustratore Fiorentino a ragione si lamento che alla parete ov’e la pittura esprimente la Misericordia si fosse in addietro fatto attaccare un casotto da impiegati che la danneggiava, e ne impediva la vista. Ma recentemente e stato staccato dal muro quel casotto, e sbassato. Pillori, p. 39 n. 1: All of these well-preserved pictures are seen still in the room of the [cassiere] of the Bigallo: the twelve expressing the actions of Saint Peter Martyr are a little blackened and damaged… The 23.
