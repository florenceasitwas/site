		<h3>Spending the Summer in Florence - Virtually</h3>
		
		<p> October 26, 2022 </p>
<p><b>Summer 2022!</b></p>

<p>Hi all! My name is Julia Brinker, and I’m a sophomore at W&amp;L. I got involved with FLAW this past spring, and had the pleasure of spending the summer 
researching, editing, and writing for the project - all from my home in Maryland! I worked on a smattering of different things, but focused specifically on Santa Croce and the Bigallo.

and we got a ton done:

		<h3>S. Lorenzo</h3>
		
		<p> August 2, 2021 </p>
<p><b> Olympic LiDAR Scanner</b></p>

<p> Professor Bent's work in Florence continues with the scanning of S. Lorenzo. </p>

<p>The church, cloister, and library of S. Lorenzo has enjoyed elevated status in Florence since its early Christian foundations. Thought to have been the city’s cathedral during the early Middle Ages, the site transformed into a neighborhood parish church that, by the end of the fourteenth-century, counted among its worshippers members of the rising Medici family.

<p>Near the end of the project, Francesco invited me to climb the scaffolding on the outside of the Cappella Maggiore that covers the church exterior that faces the city train station. I jumped at the chance, not knowing exactly what was in store for me.</p>

<p> Happy Summer Vacation! </p>

<p>My name is Ava Boussy, and I joined Florence as It Was over this past winter. Since then we’ve been hard at work cleaning up the website, models, and maps. COVID didn’t create the best travelling conditions, so Ellie, Elyssa, and I had to pass on Italy this summer, but we’re excited to have Professor Bent overseas in Florence scanning away!</p>

		<p>September 14, 2020</p>

<p>We welcome our new team members to the group in September 2020. Ellie Penner (‘23) and Georgie Gaines (‘22) join Haochen Tu (‘23) and Elyssa McMaster (‘21) as we make our way through COVID infested waters this year. While we mourn the commencement of Alice Chambers and Win Gustin in May 2020, we’re excited to move forward with the project.</p>

		<h3>Summer's End</h3>
		
		<p>August 28th, 2019</p>

<p>This is it for me! It’s been an incredibly productive month for the website and for our photogrammetry. Alice is hard at work on finishing up the Siena model, while I finally finished the San Miniato model - which we’ll hopefully be able to add to the Potree interior of that model!</p>

		<h3>Another Week Bites the Dust</h3>
		
		<p>August 16th, 2019</p>

<p>Another week down! My good friend, Alice Chambers, has returned, and it’s been full steam ahead for this project. Pretty much all week long, we’ve been busy processing these models - the Siena chapel, with all our attention to detail during the photography process paying off - and San Miniato, one of our first expeditions, which I’ve been having a little more trouble with…</p>

		<h3>Marching Orders</h3>
		
		<p>August 9th, 2019</p>

<p>It’s been a productive first week back! And, with this blog post, I have finally caught up with the backlog of posts from this summer. You might also notice some new changes on the website! We’re reworking the home page so that the buildings section is now listed as a table instead of big chunks taking up a quarter of the page - this means we’ll have more space to add future buildings as they’re worked on.</p>

		<h3>Photogrammetry, Potree, and Me</h3>
		
		<p>August 5th, 2019</p>

<p>Hello again, Lexington! Over a month later, we’re hard at work again on the Florence As It Was project, this time armed with all the technological aid W&amp;L has to offer. Those final few days in Florence were quite busy - Alice and I were both working on our respective Fulbright application drafts, and we also photographed the archives of the Innocenti, a beautiful space containing records going back to the 15th century.</p>

		<h3>Going Out with a Bang</h3>
		
		<p>June 26th, 2019</p>

<p>All signs point to us going out with a bang this week! It’s difficult to believe we only have two or three more days of work left to do in Florence - the trip really has flown by. This last weekend was a long one, capped by the festival for the city’s patron saint, San Giovanni - Alice and I were lucky enough to get perfect seats along the walls lining the Arno to watch the fireworks display above San Miniato.</p>

		<h3>Intuitive (And Not Confusing)</h3>
		
		<p>June 21st, 2019</p>

<p>We’ve had a busy week here in Florence! We’ve been working with Santa Croce on Tuesday and Thursday, making plenty of photogrammetric and point cloud models of the interior - specifically, of several of the family chapels. Hopefully, we’ll be able to embed information into these models, to be presented to viewers through some kind of easy-to-use touchscreen interface.</p>

		<h3>All About Flexibility</h3>
		
		<p>June 17th, 2019</p>

<p>So: unfortunately, I spilled a small amount of water on my laptop last week and it now refuses to turn on. Although hopefully it will be fixed soon, it really throws a wrench into our plans because we need all the storage and processing power we can get ahold of in order to get these photos into Box. It also means this post (and future posts) about our trip won’t be uploaded until much later this summer.</p>

		<h3>Hurdles to Overcome</h3>
		
		<p>June 11th, 2019</p>

<p>Professor Bent has arrived! If we were running in my last post, we’re sprinting now. Of course, a project on this scale is a marathon, not a race. We met at the Innocenti yesterday morning, working with the laser scanner to scan as much of the exterior as we could - we’ll continue that tomorrow. Today, we met again at Santa Croce to obtain high-quality scans of the exterior, which we’ll continue on Thursday.</p>

		<h3>Hitting the Ground Running</h3>
		
		<p>June 6th, 2019</p>

<p>Since arriving in Florence, we’ve really hit the ground running. Although there’s been a few setbacks - San Miniato wasn’t open when we thought it would be, and we had great difficulty figuring out where to get a tessera for our Kunsthistorische Institut IDs - but we’ve taken an astounding number of photos of the exterior and inner courtyards of Santa Croce.</p>

		<p>June 2nd, 2019</p>

<p>After days of travel, we’ve arrived!</p>

<p>Myself (Win Gustin) and Alice Chambers, both class of 2020, have successfully arrived in Florence and hauled our luggage up the six flights to our new home for the next four weeks. Although Professor George Bent won’t be joining us for another week, we’ve got plenty to do until then.</p>

		<p>It has been almost exactly 3 months since I wrote my last blog post, but that doesn’t mean I haven’t been working on the project or learning about the which necessary foundational steps we need to take for the project to succeed.</p>

<p>So here’s a quick update about my work on the project:</p>

Sam and I have been in Florence for twenty-two days now, and what we’ve realized in that time is that this project has some massive hurdles in front of it that it must overcome if we want it to become a success.</p>

Over the past few weeks Sonia and I have begun to focus more of our efforts on the actual user interface aspects of the project. When we meet with Paul in the IQ center he constantly encourages us to think about the technicalities of the program’s design, and what we can do to make it easier to use and improve the user’s experience.</p>
