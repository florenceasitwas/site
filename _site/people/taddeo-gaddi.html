<p>Taddeo Gaddi, born circa 1290, is often described as one of the most talented artists and builders living in Florence during the medieval era. Heralded as one of <a href="insert link">Giotto’s</a> most able pupils, Gaddi exuded a reverence for his master’s stylistic technique and sought to follow the artistic method of his teacher. Sometimes this resulted in a kind of imitative quality that caused <a href="insert link">Giorgio Vasari </a> to comment harshly on Gaddi’s aping of Giotto’s aesthetic, stating “(Gaddi) always continued Giotto’s manner without improving it,”  a backwards compliment that suggests a slavish imitation on the part of Taddeo Gaddi.</p>

<p>Despite working in the shadow of his famous master, Gaddi enjoyed a successful career in art, opening his own shop and receiving some of the most lucrative commissions in all of Florence. One such commission came from the Franciscan friary in the city, where Taddeo Gaddi was assigned as chief decorator for the group’s main worship center, the Basilica of <a href="insert link">Santa Croce</a>. This ornate building contains important works by Gaddi, including his frescoes of the <em>Tree of Life</em> on the west wall of the conventual <a href="insert link">Refectory</a>, quatrefoil panels of the Life of Francis that ornamented a large cabinet, and murals for the <a href="insert link">Cappella Baroncelli (1328-1330)</a>. Annunciation and visitation scenes align the altar walls of this latter space, and the large murals present themselves to viewers in grand fashion. Iconographically, these paintings are unmistakably evocative of Giotto’s work in the Arena Chapel at Padua (ca. 1305) and this imitation showcases Gaddi’s ceaseless reliance on his teacher as a fountain for inspiration. Despite Vasari’s critique, Gaddi did not merely imitate Giotto’s style, but managed to advance his master’s groundbreaking achievements: his ability to utilize natural light and rich hues to achieve perfect representations of color, seen in the Baroncelli <em>Adoration of the Magi</em>, displays Gaddi’s mastery of the color wheel that surpasses even that of Giotto’s.</p>

<p>Until his death in 1366 Taddeo Gaddi was one of the most influential men in Florentine artistic culture. Despite being viewed as a simple follower of Giotto, Taddeo triumphantly surpassed his liege in the methodology of colors and light. His work in the Basilica Santa Croce provides a canonical viewing of Gaddi’s copycat style while also underscoring his heightened proficiency with color.</p>

                <h3>Po-tree or Potree?</h3>
                <p>Hello all, my name is Ellie and I’ve just begun working on the FLAW team. I write this as I again attempt to understand the workings of Potree.  For now, I am learning the basics, such as adding to the site and embedding links within the models. This week, we luckily got an awesome tutorial from alumnus Win, who helped demonstrate how to add annotations and images into the models. With plenty of essays ready to be embedded into models such as the Bardi chapel, it is just a matter of figuring out how to do so. However, for the meantime I will hold off from working within the actual models and stick to my practice copies.</p>

<p>We have elected for our next meeting to be online, following suit with many recent
University adjustments. 
For the coming weeks, in order to move forward with larger projects, 
Georgie and I will continue to become versed in the 3D models and the site inventory.</p>

<p>Lesson of the week: if at first you don’t succeed, po-tree, po-tree, po-tree again.</p>
