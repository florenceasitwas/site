                <p>Giuseppe Richa, Notizie Istoriche delle chiese Fiorentine VII, Bigallo, 251-65, 282-96.</p>

<p>(251) Never have I written a history of a place so well documented as this one; and I have at my disposal two writings by diligent people intimately related to the Oratory, the company, and the magistrates of the Bigallo. The first of these, made by the order of Ferdinand II, was written by the Dr. Ambrogio Ambrogi, the Chancellor of the Magistrates of the Bigallo. The second appears in a very short but erudite letter by the Doctor Angiol Maria Ricci, lecturer of Greek at the Florentine Sapienza (the university) and Provost of the Bigallo of which we speak. And while it might seem that do not necessarily need to consult these works by minor authorities, in truth their texts illustrate some points that we do not encounter in other writings. Therefore it seems necessary to relate their comments, and the first we will consult is that by Ambrogi, who says the following:</p>

<p><strong>Study of the Bigallo, by Doctor Ambrogi for the Granduke</strong></p>

<p>II. The major Florentine confraternity of S. Maria del Bigallo was founded by Fra Pietro da Verona who, as a sixteen-year old was studying in Bologna in 1221, was favorably judged by Domenic, the patriarch of the Order of Preachers, and entered the Dominican order. After having illustrated his eloquence and goodness (252) by preaching in the principle cities of Italy, in 1252 – the same year as his glorious martyrdom in the name of the holy faith, perpetrated somewhere between Como and Milan – he was elevated by Innocent IV into the Catalog of Saints and dubbed S. Peter Martyr. For over 500 years, despite the ravages of time, the floods of the Arno, and other failures, his fame has been recognized by the public, as well as in the books of the confraternity of the Misericordia, so much that he is considered their principle saint. And it is in the Oratory that passed to the Misericordia in the Bigallo (a story we shall soon recount) that we see today a perpetual monument to the glorious ancient founder in the form of what was then considered an important painting on its façade in the Piazza di S. Giovanni that represents his most important act in our city. That is, when he commanded the nobility of Florence to defend the purity of the Holy Faith in the name of their fellow Florentines and sent them to the Piazza Santa Felicita and the Croce al Trebbio carrying with them the banner of the Vermilion Cross on the White Field – which is still preserved with reverence in S. Maria Novella. As the Dominicans tell it, they won two great victories against the Manichean heretics (the Patarini), and then erected two columns on behalf of the commune on that spot to commemorate their glorious accomplishment. At that moment the sign of the Holy Cross expelled the Devil, who fled from them in the form of a black horse sprinting ferociously from the Via de’ Feriavecchi to the Piazza Mercato Vecchio, where the saint was then preaching, in an attempt to intimidate and harass all the people who had come to hear him speak so that they could not listen to the Word of God. On behalf of the holy father and for the sake of his Inquisitor General, (253) Peter Martyr had examined the piety and spiritual exercises of the seven men who had founded the Order of the Servants of Mary, located on Mount Senario. They understood that the zeal and forbearance in the city of Florence was caused by the multitude of people there who were predisposed to do the work of divine Mercy that was so beneficial to mankind that God promised to these meritorious men a place next to him in his Kingdom of Heaven. We must understand how, from these difficult circumstances, the confraternity of noble Florentines came to care for the destitute, and how they evolved under the watchful patronage of the Virgin Mary, from whose mouth we have heard the sweet great words repeated by Peter the Apostle: Ego pro te oravi Petre, ut non deficiat fides tua. I, Peter, pray to you that my faith may not fail.</p>

<p>III. In order to maintain the very best constitution and for the sake of the holy works of their founding father, this confraternity immediately began to pursue with ardor important things in the various areas of Charity that could help the most destitute people from cradle to adulthood. Spurred on by the urgings of priests, prelates, and even papal figures who promised them Indulgences, Privileges, and other spiritual prerogatives, more than just a few leading citizens bequeathed copious inheritances to the confraternity to fund their pious works. This constituted a sizable amount of money, large enough to provide support for those orphans and other equally poverty-stricken people who sought the aid of Jesus Christ. And this work was done from the church of S. Maria Novella from 1279 up until the residence of the Bigallo was actually constructed in honor of God, the Madonna, (254) and all the saints.</p>

<p>IV. The company was led by a group of officials, periodically called priors, rectors, and then captains, all selected by lottery according to a quota system of two per quarter, much like the way priors were selected to govern the city in those times. Additionally, these leaders were assisted by a notary, a procurator, a chamberlain, and other figures who were brought on from time to time according to need.</p>

<p>V. This system of officials and ministers was established long before the company had its own residence, during that period when they operated out of the churches of S. Maria Novella, S. Donato tra le Torri, Orsanmichele, and other places – including a number of hospitals that cared for the destitute. They moved from place to place until that time they were able to build their own residence in the parish of S. Bartolo nel Corso, located on property donated to them by the city of Florence that was situated next to the houses owned by the Macci family, all of which was recorded in a contract written by Ser Piero di Ser Grifo on 20 June 1352.</p>

<p>VI. Continues to discuss the other hospitals in and around Florence…..</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 28
The Oratory of the Bigallo, III</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to the learned Doctor Angelo Maria Ricci, who conveyed this information about the history of the Bigallo in a letter.</p>

<p>I.	It’s a truly marvelous thing that you’re doing to write this precise and accurate history of Florentine churches. It’s important that every Florentine read your work, not just to praise it, but to understand all the things that have been done here and what was taken from us by foreignors.</p>

<p>II.	My contribution, which concerns the great works undertaken by those in the Oratory of S. Maria del Bigallo, has been written with the sanction of the Regent (of Austria) in the name of the most August sovereign.</p>

<p>III.	Andrea Pisano made the marble statue that represents the standing Madonna with the Christ Child in her arms, which can be seen in a beautiful niche above the altar. Two marble angels are there, too, but they seem to be somewhat feminine and they wear on their heads tiaras (283) similar to the one worn by the Madonna that suggest they’re Jewish women. It’s said that a master named Antonio, called il Carota, designed the beautiful wooden altar and decorated it richly.</p>

<p>IV.	The son of Domenico Ghirlandaio painted the small scenes in the predella below. Five pictures of better quality also appear. In the middle picture is painted the Madonna smiling at two angels, with her arms and her cloak open to them. To her right and above appears Jesus Christ with his arms open; and at the feet of the Virgin one sees two bishops and other people, some religious and some secular, and then many women in different positions of veneration. At the farthest point on the right of the same painting appears the Virgin in adoration, Joseph in contemplation, and the Baby Jesus lying almost comically on a red cloak. To the left is the Virgin holding the Child in her arms while Joseph, in the lead, takes them to Egypt.</p>

<p>V.	In the painting in the Cornu Evangelii (literally, the Horn of the Evangelist) the painter created a passionately rendered figure of St. Peter Martyr dipping his finger into his own blood to write in the earth the Apostles Creed. Above we see the assassin about to commit a second crime, chasing after the frightened friar who accompanied the Saint. The assassin carries in his left hand a shield upon which appears a half scorpione and three crowns, one arranged on top of the other, fall from the sky in front of the Holy Martyr, Saint Peter. The picture in the Cornu Epistolae (literally, the Horn of the Epistle Writers) appears Tobit in an act of unearthing a corpse, helped by Tobias (his son). And here one sees in the loggia of the morgue with the old gates, that were later removed in order to wall up the area. In the painting we can see the two facades, where today appear the Porta dell’Oratorio and the one next to it. Finally, there appears a funeral bier, the sign of the Company of the Misericordia. In some of the rood screens (“tramezzi”) (284) that appear in these paintings we see two round paintings, each one bearing the coats of arms of the Company of the Bigallo – that is, with a white rooster on a blue field with the letters S. M. B. – and those of the Company of the Misericordia – that is, with a red cross on a similarly blue field with the letters F. M. E. (It’s important to note that today the coat of arms of the Misericordia appears to change the F to an R. This is because in the old script the F had a long horizontal line at the top which attached to the horizontal line below, which then seemed to form an R). Below we see seven areas filled with three large panels and four smaller ones. In the largest panel in the middle appears the Assumption of the Virgin among angels who hold flowers. In the smaller flanking panels of the Cornu Evangelii appear the figure of Tobias, the Angel, and the Fish.</p>

<p>VI.	Following along in the same area, but in one of the major pictures, we come to a painting of the Holy Virgin kneeling on the ground before the Holy Father above her, with angels surrounding them like courtiers. The nude figures of Adam and Eve join them, according to the tradition in which they are shown being judged by God.</p>

<p>VII.	In the little panel at the top of the grade appears woman, perhaps a Sybil, writing something, joined by two others in small pictures at the Cornu Epistolae. In the large panel between them is painted the Annunciation of the Virgin.</p>

<p>VIII.	Above these is a tabernacle venerated on the Feast of S. Peter Martyr, in which is a carved and gilded relief by the same Master Antonio, called il Carota. Inside the tabernacle, on the bottom part, lies a gilt bronze scene featuring a statuette of S. Peter Martyr with a knife in his cloak and a sword pushed into his right leg, and with the palm of his right hand. In the upper part appear the letters N. I. along with evidence of an A and other letters no longer visible. (285) This letters demand interpretation if we wish to understand them. In the windows of the tabernacle appears S. John the Baptist, in the back right, and Tobit in the left, painted sometime around 1510 – the same time as the other pictures here – by the same artist responsible for them: but not by Domenico Ghirlandaio, as many believe, but rather by one of his three sons – Davide, Benedetto, or Ridolfo: Domenico had been dead since 1493. At the foot of the tabernacle’s base is sculpted the martyrdom of S. Peter Martyr, in the same way that the scene appears in the painting described above.</p>

<p>IX.	In this oratory, dedicated to the Virgin Mary and therefore called S. Maria del Bigallo, people venerate also S. Peter Martyr and Tobit, as is evident by their appearance in the three paintings in the upper zone. Members celebrate solemnly the Feasts of the Annunziation, S. Peter Martyr, Tobit on the third Sunday in September, when the story of the prophet is read inside the church. Beginning with First Vespers, his feast day is observed with the ritual that doubles that of the First Class.</p>

<p>X.	The feast observed with the most pomp and solemnity, however, is that of S. Peter Martyr due to his position as founder of the Bigallo and his important preachings against the Paterini Heresy. These episodes are depicted in two extremely old paintings produced, we think, by Taddeo Gaddi in the arches on the side of the Oratory – one in the area already described and the other over the place where the banners were given to the twelve men, called the twelve Good Men of the Bigallo, to fight the heretics. Some lovely sermons were delivered about the Paterini by the Doctor Giovanni Lami, that I heard in the Accademia della Crusca. One of the banners is kept in S. Maria Novella inside a Reliquary. (286) Another that appears there is a copy of the original: it bears a red cross on a white field with a red border around it, not unlike the banner given out as a prize for horse races, except that it is smaller and has no strip. In the painting the banners don’t look like these, but that’s probably due to artistic license. The other eleven banners were famously kept in the Bigallo, but were unfortunately lost alongside many old books: there is good reason to believe they perished in the violence of flooding at some point in time.</p>

<p>XI.	Depending on need, there are four officers of the Oratory. Among their other duties is the performance of mass – including the singing of three masses each week; one on Mondays for the Dead, another on Thursdays for Peace, and the last on Saturday for the Virgin Mary. The saying of Mass on Thursdays falls on the shoulders of Mone Fantini Taverniere (or Vinattiere) to placate any civil discord.</p>

<p>XII.	But because the above mentioned number of officers are not always available to perform these solemn festivals, other priests intervene in eight other feasts of lesser importance so that the oratory becomes something like a “collegiata,” or collegiate church, if one considers the offices, masses, and choruses performed vigorously by pious and devout people, just as they were in ancient times.</p>

<p>XIII.	The Company of S. Maria del Bigallo had been founded to perform charitable works and was supported by hospitals, including that of the Misericordia that provided burials for the dead, especially during times of plague. They were initially independent, but then the Misericordia of the Bigallo came under the domain of the church of S. Cristofano, and then moved to that location where they are today, which was initially the first Residence of the Magistrate of the Wards of the State. Ferdinando del Migliore’s (287) diligent review of the archives and his use of their documents confirms this history of the first iteration of the Misericordia.</p>

<p>XIV.	At last I refer to an unusually old document in a folder of parchment in the Oratory’s archives, clearly prepared for them at their request, but undated so I don’t know precisely when it was written. It appears in a book, two-feet tall and covered in wood with golden corners, that has been finished with a triangular image that shows Jesus emerging from his tomb on one leg with arms extended with a cross behind him. The following text accompanies the image: IN THE NAME OF GOD, AMEN. THIS BUILDING IS THE HOME OF THE GREAT COMPANY FOUNDED BY SAINT PETER MARTYR ON THE DAY OF THE ASCENSION OF CHRIST IN THE YEAR 1244 TO HONOR REVERENTLY OUR GLORIOUS MOTHER, THE VIRGIN MARY. EVERY THURSDAY A MASS OF PEACE IS PERFORMED: MEMBERS OF THE COMPANY WHO ATTEND RECEIVE AN INDULGENCE FROM PURGATORY OF THREE YEARS AND 320 DAYS, GRANTED TO THEM BY THE BISHOPS OF FLORENCE – SIR GIOVANNI AND SIR GOTTIFREDI AND SIR FRANCESCO – WHO GAVE TO THE COMPANY AN ADDITIONAL TWO YEARS AND 300 DAYS OF INDULGENCES. THE VENERABLE FRIARS GENERAL AND THE ORDER OF PREACHERS MINOR AND HERMITS AND CARMELITES AND MONKS OF ALL THE ORDERS CEDED TO THEM THE THINGS THEY NEEDED FOR ALL THE LIVING AND THE DEAD OF THE WORLD.</p>

<p>XV.	(288) On the opposite side, completely painted, is another triangle with a half-length Madonna holding the Christ Child in her arms, with S. Peter Martyr on their right holding a lily in his hand and S. Francis on their left holding a book. In the space below S. Peter Martyr (standing in front of confraternity members) consigns the standard to one of them, who kneels at his feet to receive it. Other standards in different colors, already handed out to other members, appear on the opposite side. This painting seems to have been produced by someone from the school of Giotto, perhaps an assistant, who may have copied it from him.</p>

<p>XVI.	Speaking of pictures, there’s another similar standard above one of the arches, made of linen and in such poor condition that it is patched, that is now kept in S. Maria Novella. Everyone knows it is ancient. I have spoken of other things I’ve observed, but I will have to tell you about this personally some other time. From my house on 5 May 1755, your devoted servant, Angio Maria Ricci.</p>

<p>XVII.	These writers, who have studied the documents, have established an accurate account of history. But, because they have some doubts about a few points, I will address some essential things they have omitted, like the origins of the two confraternities – that is, the primary company of the Virgin Mary called the Bigallo and the old Company of the Misericordia – whose union is misunderstood because, I believe, they were both founded by S. Peter Martyr. (289) Those who oppose this argument include the above-mentioned Ambrogio, Roselli, and many others. Ferdinando del Migliore supported it, as can be seen in Firenze Illustrata, where on page 78 he writes, “Before passing over this, we must speak briefly of the other twelve hospitals under their care that were divided between two separate organizations: the first was called S. Maria del Bigallo (a.k.a. the company of S. Peter Martyr) and the other was called S. Maria della Misericordia, although both were governed by the same captains of the confraternity in Florence. This experiment lasted a long time, and with some success. But happily, in 1425 – at a time when the citizens of Florence were preoccupied with threats from outside their walls and disastrous wars threatened the state – the city fathers deliberated in the Senate and passed a law that united the two companies and formed a new entity with the name of S. Maria del Bigallo. Eight captains governed the company and placed on the façade of their residence hall their coat of arms, which was a shield divided vertically with, in one section, a red cross on a black field with the letter F, on another the letter M in a gold band, and on the third part a white rooster on a blue background with the letters S.M.B. underneath.”</p>

<p>XVIII.	Now I have reflected at length on this issue, and other difficult questions that demand explanation. For example, we wonder about the pictures of S. Peter Martyr painted by Taddeo Gaddi on the façade of the Oratory, or about identity of the person who painted the strip of the building facing the Baptistery of S. Giovanni that shows the image of the Company honoring their saintly founder. An objective critique of del Migliore’s position leads us to understand that the Bigallo, which was not yet united with the Misercorida until 1425, could not have commissioned Gaddi to paint these pictures: only the Company of the Misericordia could have done this, and yet the painter is said to have done every single picture there. Likewise wonder about the discrepancies contained in the writings about the foundation of the Bigallo, one which places it in 1240 and another in 1244, another which combines the two companies as a unified body at that early date. It’s confusing because a contract written by Ser Piero di Ser Grifo, on 28 June 1352, says that the Signoria permitted the Bigallo to build its Residence in the parish of S. Bartolo al Corso: in 1352 the Misericordia and the Bigallo were two separate entities, as del Migliore says, and the latter didn’t have a house later on. And if we said above that the captains first met in one specific place in the city, but then a different one, then it seems they didn’t have an actual Residence Hall at all, and instead went from house to house as circumstances dictated or as benefactors permitted them use. I have in my possession a document written by the Captains in S. Maria sul Prato, which says the following: “On 14 August, 1297, Mazzottus Bacherelli, Bartolus Ugolini, Ser Ciprianus q. Riccomanni, Ser Guido Spadaccii, Folchardinus Bonsignori, Ubaldinus Ardinghelli, Guido Ramaglianti, &amp; Vieri Arrussi Rectores, the officers of the Society of the Blessed Virgin Mary, in concert with Corteccione the son of Iohannes de Rustici acting as official on behalf of the nuns of S. Maria del Prato in Florence: On this solemn day the above named men ceded to Corteccione the full license and deed to the Church of the Castagno held by Fra Humilis and Fra Michele for this confraternity, situated in Monte Basciano near the Caves of Verzaia, etc.” to whom it may concern; (291) and if it is the case, as it seems, that the those who received the church and land departed from it, it would all return back to the Company of the Misericordia, the original owners. Witnessed by the notary Rusticus, son of Ugonis.”</p>

<p>XIX.	 Yet another problem arises when we consider the origins of the Oratory itself, the place of its original location, and its date of construction. Ambrogi says that the original Company of the Misericordia bought some houses from Baldinaccio degli Adimari at the piazza di S. Giovanni, and on this was built the Oratory and the Residence Hall. But Leopoldo del Migliore, on page 81, diverges from this argument when he writes: “There we have the different stories about the old Oratory of the Misericordia, located where there was once the Tower of the Guardamorto and the public room of the exhibition of the cadavers,” and at the same time says that the ruined tower was ceded to the Republic by S. Pieter of Verona in order to provide a place for the new Company of the Misericordia, which the Captains then used as their Oratory and Residence. Migliore depended entirely on Rosselli’s memoirs for this interpretation, and states unequivocally that the Oratory was built on top of the ruins of the tower with a strong foundation, large walls, and an impressive fortified gate, none of which could have been made for the Oratory of moderate height and weight. And we note that the delusional argument that the Oratory of the Bigallo was built between 1240 and 1244 cannot hold, because we see, on page 123 of the Malespini chronicle and on page 177 of Givoanni Villani’s text, that the tower did not collapse until 1248: Villani writes, “The Guelphs showed tremendous faith and dedication to the church, the cathedral, and the Baptistery of S. Giovanni, and they went there on Sunday mornings to worship, and had many weddings. When the Ghibellines decided to punish the Guelphs, they chose to destroy their fortress, the tower, that sat at the corner of the Corso Adimari on the piazza S. Giovanni. Designed by Nicola Pisano and called the “Torre del Guardamorto,” the tower had long been the favored resting place of the city’s leading citizens who wished to be buried by the Baptistery. The Ghibellines tore down the supports, one by one, and burned them all; but, due to the wishes of God and Saint John the Baptist, only half of the tower fell into the piazza. They then ordered the destruction of the rest of the tower, which had been 120 braccia tall.” We can see that the tower was both very close to the Baptistery of S. Giovanni and that it fell only during the sacrilegious vendetta of the Ghibellines in 1248, meaning that the Bigallo could not have participated in the building of the residence on the spot of the great architect Nicola Pisano’s ruined tower. Unfortunately, an error in a diary written by Rondinelli indicates that, “in 1411 the Oratory of the Bigallo was built on the alley of the Corso de’Brigliai.” Instead, we can see that the entirety of the Oratory’s exterior, including the colonnettes, arches, and reliefs, were clearly built much earlier than this.</p>

<p>XX.	Then when the companies of the Bigallo and the Misericordia ceded the title of the captains, they became a conspicuous magistrate of Florence, whose principle concern revolved around the care of abandoned children, as we have seen in an earlier section of this book. During the early years of the Republic, the Bigallo received orphaned boys and girls separated from their parents and homeless, as seen in various official documents and statutes (293) of the commune, as for example under the rubric 117 of book 3, where we see the following words: “Whoever found unattended children wandering through the streets brought them to the house of the Misercordia in the Piazza Orsanmichele, the official orphanage sanctioned by the commune;” as well a these by Fra Domenico da Corella in his Theotocon from ca. 1460: “Thus my tiny house was visited by the Madonna who has no pity. This is what happens when children are abandoned, for should the parent perish there’s no telling what could happen to them. But they should be protected under a safe roof until they can be restored to their parents. This is what is expected in our pious city.”</p>

<p>XXI.	And as I have already written of principle parts of this story, it’s appropriate to comment at last on some paintings inside, owned by the Bigallo but maintained by the aforementioned Dr. Angelo Maria Ricci, who is the head of the small but important collegiata. And therefore we consider a large picture above the great doorway into the building, painted in fresco, that represents a mourning mother (who has surrendered her child) in the midst of a variety of beautifully depicted orphans. She happily comes to receive her children from the captains of the Bigallo, and stands among the houses and towers that appeared there in those days, as is noted in a document of 1444, on page 8 in book X of the Bigallo’s archives, where one also sees the name of the painter: “1444 June 1. The Captains of the Bigallo and Misericordia order that payment be made from the orphanage to the painter, Piero Chellino, for the remainder of the work he has done to produce the painting on the façade of the captain’s residence.” In the corridor of the main Audience Hall are some damaged paintings, blackened and broken not unlike those that occupy all the sections across from the Porta del Magistrato, (294) that were not intended to be seen this way. On the level of the stairs, four feet up toward the second floor, appears a Christ rising up out of his tomb with his arms open, holding in a sense a multitude of people seeking mercy; underneath are two inscriptions written in Gothic script that say, “Oh, all you who pass this way, come inside and see my son on the cross who has died for your sins. If you have sinned, beg for mercy and you shall receive it. O sinners, it is because you have not wept for your sin that here you see the death of our Lord Jesus Christ who was crucified for your salvation. You would be wise to pray to the Mother of Mercy.”</p>

<p>XXII.	And to the right of this door one sees and extremely old picture in fresco of a giant figure of the Madonna of Mercy, shown as a loving person wearing a cope and a round mitre on her head, with a fine stole, and at her feet are some worshippers from the Misericordia, with Longobard writing. This figure carries an air of a patron saint, with kneeling people on either side of a representation of Florence as it then appeared within the second circuit of city walls. The painter of this image explained his message in an inscription written in quasi-gothic hand that has a touch of antiquity to it, which states, “All mercies and good works are done in this place according to the wise actions of its members, 1352.” (295) Leaving this loggia, on the right hand side, are six hooks on the wall, two steps up the stairs and about six feet high, that according to tradition were used during the attack on the cathedral when S. Peter Martyr preached in the Piazza di S. Giovanni. We don’t have any way to confirm this, other than the sayings of some old people, but we’ll leave it up to the judgment of people to decide for themselves whether this is true. And on the door of the Audience Hall, by the coat of arms of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, appears an inscription that states, “The most serene Cosimo the Great, Duke of Etruria; pious men affectionately serve to receive abandoned children, and then return them to worthy people who will care for them.”</p>

<p>XXIII.	And here we reach of this story, where I must refer to the enormous struggles in and around Florence during the years of the plague that engendered so many tremendous charitable acts by our confraternity in the face of mass slaughter. The first occurred during the famine of 1325 caused by the war of the Altopascio; the second in 1340 that carried away a sixth of the population, many of them members of the nobility; the third was seven years later, in the year 1348 when the Black Death arrived and killed one hundred thousand souls, including the famous historian Giovanni Villani. His brothers, Matteo and Giovanni, succumbed to the plague of 1363, which was followed by two others that century, one in 1374 and the other in 1383. It came back again in 1400, this time called the Plague of the Bianchi after a certain flagellant confraternity that processed through the countryside, and again killed a lot of people. The ninth (sic) plague came in 1411 and the tenth (sic) in 1417, which killed 16 thousand more. There were others in 1422, 1430, and 1437. Another called the “Anguinata” came in 1449 and swept through the countryside. It was followed by one in 1465 – the sixteenth great mortality – and another in 1479 – the seventeenth – that took away Marsilio Ficino, author of the famous illustrated book called The Cure for Plague. Another three came in 1495, 1498, and 1509, although they were minor. The most ferocious and lengthy of them all lasted from 1525 to 1527, which Varchi says killed an almost infinite number of men. After this the city was preserved from plague for 103 years, until in 1630 when a new one was discovered in Milan, which traveled to the gates of Bologna, and then hit Florence hard. The Misericordia was active in those days, like its descendent is today, and received the praise of the people who came to it in times of need – and also in the final stages of plague – to find some peace. Long Live the Company of the Misericordia! But, of course, this was not the last of the plagues, for yet another returned in 1633: but thanks to the diligence of the Grand Duke Ferdinand, who knew enough about previous plagues to quarantine the entire city, the people were saved and the health of Italy was preserved thanks to the love, power, and diligence of the Prince.</p>

<p>251 – I. Non mai ho scritto Istoria tanto ben corredata di autorevoli documenti, quanto la presente; imperciocchè sono presso di me, di due illustri Persone diligentissime relazioni, o si voglia dell’Oratorio, o della Compagnia, o del Magistrato del Bigallo; la prima di dette Scritture fu fatta per ordine di Ferdinando II dal Dottore Ambrogio Ambrogi Cancelliere del Magistrato del Bigallo; la seconda consiste in una cortesissima, ed erudita lettera del Signor Dottore Angiol Maria Ricci, Lettor di lingua Greca nella Sapienza Fiorentina, e Proposto del medesimo Bigallo all’Autor di questa Storia. E per vero dire non abbisognavano queste Lezioni di minore autorità; avvegnachè per illustrar alcuni punti incontransi difficultà di non leggiero momento. Quindi necessario mi sembra il riportare qui amendue, e il primo document sia quell dell’Ambrogi, che dice come appresso:</p>

<p><strong>Relazione del Dotore Ambrogi al Granduca Sopra il Bigallo</strong></p>

<p>II. La Compagnia Maggiore di S. Maria del Bigallo della Città di Firenze fu fondata da quell Fra Pietro da Verona, che nell’anno 1221, sedicesimo di sua vita, mentre studiava in Bologna, fu ricevuto dal Patriarca S. Domenico nella sua novella Religione de’Predicatori, e dopo l’havere illustrate le principali Città d’Italia con la sua dottrina, eloquenza, e bontà, chiaro (252) per molti miracoli, sotto Innocenzio IV nell’istesso anno 1252 del suo glorioso Martirio sostenuto tra Como, e Milano per la dilatazione della Santa Fede, meritò di essere annoverato nel Catalogo de’Santi sotto nome di S. Pier Martire: così per continuata tradizione di circa 500 anni ne corre sino al presente pubblica la fama, et anco i libri più antichi della medesima Compagnia, che l’ingiuria del tempo, l’inondazioni d’Arno non hanno totalmente laceri, e guasti, affermano questo gran Santo esserne stato l’autore e il principio. E l’istesso Oratorio da che passò dalla Compagnia della Misericordia in questa del Bigallo, nel modo che si vedrà poco appresso, ci rappresenta sino oggi a perpetua memoria di sì glorioso Fondatore un’antica, e secondo que’ tempi non mediocre pittura nella maggior facciata sulla Piazza di S. Giovanni, rappresentante la più memoranda azione, che egli operò nella nostra Città; cioè quando a que’nobili Fiorentini da lui schierati per difendere la purità della Santa Fede con cui si viveva in Firenze, diede il Gonfalone della Croce Vermiglia in campo bianco, che sino al presente con molta venerazione si conserva in Santa Maria Novella, con il quale su la Piazza di Santa Felicita, e dalla Croce al Trebbio, come largamente raccontano I’Istorie Domenicane, ottennero contro gli Eretici Manichei quelle due gran vittorie, delle quali fin’ora con due colonne erette dal Popolo Fiorentino ne’detti due medesimi luoghi, dove furono ottenute, si conserva gloriosa la ricordanza. E quando con il segno della Santa Croce fece sparer di subito il Demonio, che in forma visibile di un nero e sfrenato Cavallo, velocemente correndo dalla Via de’Feriavecchi alla Piazza di Mercato Vecchio, dove era il Santo a predicare, tentava di intimorire e sbaragliare il Popolo, che quasi senza numero vi era congregato al solito per ascoltarlo, e così d’impedire il frutto della parola d’Iddio. Haveva veduto il Santo Padre, e per ragione del suo offizio di generale Inquisitore (253) diligentemente haveva esaminato il gran progresso nella via dello spirit, che tra le solitudini di Monte Senario andavano facendo i sette Nobili Contemplativi Fondatori dell’Ordine de i Servi di Maria, e per il zelo, che teneva della salvezza de’prossimi, poteva eziamdio haver considerate, che la Città di Firenze non meno abbondava di Persone con ingenita attitudine agevolmente disposta all’Opere della Misericordia Corporali, che infinitamente giovevoli al genere umano, et al Signore Iddio accettissime, costituiscono gli Uomini meritevoli appresso alla sua Divina pieta, del Regno de’Cieli. Onde dobbiamo di facile persuaderci, che da tali considerazioni incitato, ereggesse questa Compagnia di Nobili Fiorentini Secolari per sovvenimento delle Persone miserabili, ponendola con viva fede di memoranda progressi sotto il Patrocinio di Maria sempre Vergine, dalla cui bocca era stato favorite di udire quelle dolci, e gran parole, che già all’altro Pietro Principe degli’Apostoli haveva detto l’Incarnato Vergo: Ego pro te oravii Petre, ut non deficiat fides tua.</p>

<p>III. Questa Compagnia per le ottime constituzioni, e per i divini ammaestramenti del suo buon Padre e Fondatore, cominciò subito con ardore così grande ad esercitarsi in tutte le Opere di Carità per sovvimento delle persone miserabili, che sino ne’suoi teneri natali si acquistò il nome di Maggiore. Fu da’ Sommi Pontefici, da molti Prelati di Santa Chiesa, e Superiori di Religioni adornata d’Indulgenze, di Privilegi, e d’altre spirituali prerogrativi, e da non pochi Cittadini gli fu fatto di grossi legati, lasciate copiose eredità, e raccomandata l’esecuzione in perpetuo di pie disposizioni. Onde costituitasi una non mediocre sostanza, potette sempre assai largamente porgere aiuto alle miserabili fanciulle in sussidio di loro Dore (?), et in ogni altra maniera soccorrere alle necessità de’poveri di Gesù Cristo; e sino talora concerere alle gran fabbriche, che si ereggevano in onore di Dio, della sua Santa (254) Madre, e de’suoi Santi, come in specie seguì l’anno 1279, per l’Opera di Santa Maria Novella.</p>

<p>IV. Era governata tempo per tempo da alcuni Ofiziali, che da principio si chiamarono Priori, e Rettori, e dipoi Capitani, quali si traevano dale borse, due per Sestiere, o per Quartiere, secondo che per i tempi si governava la Città; e di più haveva un Notaio, un Provveditore, un Camarlingo, et altri Ministri, secondo il bisogno.</p>

<p>V. Si adunavano questi Offiziali, e Ministri, mentre la Compagnia per ancora non haveva luogo proprio, nella Chiesa di S. Maria Novella, e di S. Donato tra le Torri, da Orsammichele, et in altri luoghi, ma specialmente nelli Spedali alla lor Cura sottoposti, sin che si fabbricarno Residenza proporzionata nel Popolo di S. Bartolo nel Corso, accanto alle case de’Macci, sopra il terrento donatoli dal Comune di Firenze per Instrumento rogato Ser Piero di Ser Grifo, 20 Giugno 1352.</p>

Lezione XXVII
Dell’Oratorio del Bigallo III</p>

<p>Lettera del Chiarissimo Signor Dottore Angelo Marie Ricci Proposto del Bigallo, all’Autore della Storia.</p>

<p>I.	Meritevoli per vero dire di molta lode sono le sue premure di compilare un’esatta Istoria delle Chiese Fiorentine, ed è ben giusto, che ogni Fiorentino, non solo le faccia applause, e le professi una grata riconoscenza, ma si adoperi eziandio in somministrarle notizie, e alleggerirle alcun poco una sì grave fatica, che con gran maraviglia di chi ben riflette, Ella, che da altra patria trasse l’origine, ha coraggiosamente intrapresa.</p>

<p>II.	Ecco pertanto, che io dalla mia parte contribuisco alla sua grand’Opera qualche coserella a me nonta intorno all’Oratorio di Santa Maria del Bigallo, di cui pochi mesi sono, conferita mi fu dall’Imperial Reggenza in nome dell’Augustissimo Sovrano la Prepositura.</p>

<p>III.	Una Statua di marmo, al naturale rappresentante la Madonna in piedi col Bambino in collo, che si vede in una bella nicchia elevate sovra l’Altare, è lavoro di Andrea Pisano. Vi sono dale bande due creduti Angioli pur di marmo, ma oltre al non aver l’ale, la lor sembianza par piurtosto femminile, ed hanno in testa la mitra delle Donne Ebree, ch si vede (283) de similmente in capo all suddetta Statua della Vergine. L’adornamento di tutto quanto l’Altare è di legname dorato, molto vago e ricco, opera, dice il Migliore, d’un tale Messer Antonio detto il Carota.</p>

<p>IV.	Due sono I gradi sottoposti dipinti con vari quadretti da alcuno de’Figli di Domenico Ghierlandaio. Facendomi dal grado superior, cinque sono gli spartimenti, o dir vogliamo I quadretti. Nel quadretto di mezzo è dipinta la Madonna colle braccia aperte, e col manto disteso, sorretto da due Angioli. A man destra per di sopra è Gesù Cristo col Costato aperto; a’ piedi poi della Vergine si vedono da una banda due Vescovi, e altre Persone, parte Religiose, e parte Secolari, e dall’Altra molte femmine in diverse guise ammantate. Di più dalla parte destra del medesimo quadretto è dipinta la Vergine in atto di adorazione, S. Giuseppe in atto di contemplazione, e Gesù Bambino giacente in terra sur uno Strato rosso in atto quasi scherzoso. Dalla sinistra poi la Madonna col Bambino in collo, che va in Egitto, e S. Giuseppe avanti, che fa la guida.</p>

<p>V.	Nel quadretto in Cornu Evangelii effigiò il Pittore con viva espressione S. Pier Martire già ferito, inginocchioni, che scrive in terra col ditto intinto nel proprio sangue il Credo, e sopra si mira il fiero Sicario, che gli avventa un altro colpo, e il Frate compagnio del Santo, che spaventato se ne fugge. Il Sicario tiene colla mano sinistra uno scudo avente in mezzo uno scorpione, e tre corone calano giù dal Cielo una sopra l’altra per ornar la fronte al Santo Martire. Nel quadretto in Cornu Epistolae v’ è Tobbia in atto di sotterrare un morto, aiutato da Tobbiolo. E qui si vede la loggia del Guardamorto colle cancellate antiche, che furon poi levate, e alzate in luogo di loro le pareti. Si vedono parimente le due facciate, cioè quella dove è la Porta dell’Oratorio, e l’altra laterale. Per ultimo è figurate da una banda la Compagnia della Misericordia col cataletto. Ne I tramezzi (284) de’quadretti descritti vi sono due tondi, ognuno de’quali porta le Armi della Compagnia di Santa Maria del Bigallo, che è un Gallo bianco in Campo azzurro con le tre lettere S. M. B. e della Comagnia della Misericordia, che è una Croce rossa in campo similmente azzurro, con le due lettere F. M. E. qui si vuol notare, che inoggi nell’Arme della Misericordia la lettera F è stata cangiata in R; il che è addivenuto perchè avendo l’F nella scrittura antica uno svolazzo all’ingiù nella linea orizzontale superiore, questo essendosi allungaro, e attaccato colla linea orizzontale inferiore, ha forma un R. Il grado inferiore ha sette spartimenti: Tre sono I quadretti maggiori, e Quattro I minori. Nel quadretto maggiore di mezzo è l’Assunta con molti Angioli, che spargono fiori. Nel quadrettino allato in Cornu Evangelii evvi Tobbiolo, l’Angiolo, e il Pesce.</p>

<p>VI.	Segue dalla medesima parte altro quadretto maggiore, ove è dipinta la Vergine Santissima genuflessa in terra, il Padre Eterno al disopra, e dale bande Angioli, che la corteggiano; giciono in terra nudi colle sole fasce alle parti verende Adamo, ed Eva, secondo che verisimilmente si giudica.</p>

<p>VII.	Nel quadrettino, che segue in cima del grado, v’è una Donna, che scrive, e si crede essere una Sibilla, siccome pure ne’due quadrettini in Cornu Epistolae sembrano espresso due sibille, e nel quadretto maggiore posto fra essi, è dipinta la Nunziata.</p>

<p>VIII.	Sopra questi gradi si colloca nella Festa di S. Pier Martire un Tabernacolo assai leggiadro alto un braccio in circa di fino intaglio, e doratura, lavoro forse del medesimo Maestro Antonio detto il Carota, dentro al quale è incassata una Macchinetta di bronzo dorato, nel cui mezzo è la Statuetta di S. Pier Martire col cultello in capo, e colla spade ficcata nell’omero destro, e colla palma nella mano destra. Nella superior parte della Macchinetta vi sono le lettere N.I. e alquanto più su evvi un A, e altre lettere, che non (285) si leggono. Il mettersi a interpetrare queste lettere, è lo stesso, che il voler far da indovno. Il Tabernacolo ha i suoi sportellini, nel destro de’quali per di dentro è dipinto S. Gio. Batista, nel sinistro S. Tobbia, e comecchè v’è il millesimo, cioè 1510 per questo penso, che anche le pitture de’gradi, che paiono della medesima, mano, non sieno di Domenico Ghirlandaio, come molti vogliono, ma di alcuno de’tre suoi Figli David, Benedetto, Ridolfo, poichè Domenico morì nel 1493. A piè della base della macchinetta è scolpito il martirio di S. Pier martire, nella stessa guise che si vede dipinto nel quadretto del grado descritto di sopra.</p>

<p>IX.	In quest’Oratorio dedicato alla Vergine, che però chiamasi di Santa Maria del Bigallo, si venerano come contitolari s. Pier Martire, e S. Tobbia, come accennano le tre pitture del grado superiore: onde, solennenmente vi si celebra la Festa della Assunzione, la Festa di S. Pier Martire, e la Festa di S. Tobbia il giorno della Domenica 3 di Settembre, quando la Chiesa pone nel Divino Ufizio il libro della Storia del medesimo. In esso giorno adunque si fa la sua Festa, cominciando da i primi Vespri, con rito di doppio di prima Classe.</p>

<p>X.	La Festa però, che con maggior pompa dell’altre si solennizza, è quella di S. Pier Martire, poichè dicesi essere stato l’Autore dell’instituto del Bigallo, ed avere in questo angolo principalmente predicato contro l’Eresia de’Paterini, vedendosi due dipinture molto antiche, di mano (credesi) di Taddeo Gaddi sopra gli archi della parte laterale dell’Oratorio, in una delle quali predica, e nell’altra consegna gli Stendardi a 12 Uomini (che furon detti i 12 Buoni Uomini del Bigallo) per combattere contro i detti Eretici. Sopra i Paterini compose già alcune bella Lezioni il Signor Dottore Giovanni Lami, da me con piacere udite nell’Accademia della Crusca. Uno de’mentovati Stendardi conservasi in Santa Maria Novella frall’altre venerabili Reliquie: per altro non pare a taluno (286) essere l’antico, ma altro rifatto su quell modello: il suddetto Stendardo è bianco con croce rossa, la quale piglia tutta l’estensione di esso, e con orlo rosso intorno intorno, ed è il simile al palio, che si pone per premio nella corsa de’Cavalli, salvo che è più piccolo, e non ha striscia. Nella pittura suddetta le bandiere non son fatte così, ma si può supporre una libertà pittoresca. E’ fama che gli altri undici si serbassero nel Bigallo, e andassero male in alcuna delle piene, in cui moli antichi libri ancora perissero; e in fatti in cattivo stato ridotto, e dalla belletta gusto si vede alcuno di essi, che potè alla violenza dell’acque ritogliersi(?).</p>

<p>XI.	Quattro sono i Cappellani, che ufiziano l’Oratorio, e dipendono da un Proposto. Oltre agli oblighi delle Messe piane, son tenuti a cantare tre messe la Settimana, il Lunedì de Morti, il Giovedì della Pace, e il Sabato della Madonna. L’obbligo della Messa della pace dicesi lasciato da Mone Fantini Taverniere, o Vinattiere mosso dagli avvenimenti funesti delle civili discordie.</p>

<p>XII.	Ma perchè il suddetto numero di Cappelanni riuscirebbe scarso per le tre Feste solenni accennate, vi sono altri Preti fino al numero di 12 che allora intervengono, e in altre Feste di non tanta solennità ne intervengono otto, talchè questo Oratorio viene ad avere quasi una Collegiata di non così leggier conto, se si consideri l’Ufiziatura continovata delle Messe, e del Coro, che ab antico è quivi stabilità, in vigore, de’ lasciti delle piè, e divote Persone.</p>

<p>XIII.	La Compagnia di Santa Maria del Bigallo ebbe origine della carità, e cura degli Spedali: quella della Misericordia dal raccogliere i Morti, e dar loro Sepoltura, specialmente in tempo di peste. Erano da prima unita, ma poi furono separate, e quella della Misericordia dal Bigallo passò alla Chiesa di S. Cristofano, e quindi al luogo, dove di presente, che era prima la Residenza del Magistrato de i Pupilli. Il Migliore (287) tratta prima della Misericordia veechia, poi della nuova, onde da esso, e da altri documenti la sua industriosa instancabile diligenza potrà assembrare sicure notizie, da formare una, o più aggradevoli, e utili Lezioni.</p>

<p>XIV.	Per ultimo le trasmetto la copia d’una Cartella, che è appesa nell’Oratorio di caratteri d’oro antichi, che essendo logori prima che si dileguassero affatto, fu avvedutamente ordinate, che si rifiorissero, ma non so precisamente in qual tempo. Ella è scritta in un quadro di legno con cornice dorata alto un braccio in circa, e nella parte superiore finisce in un triangolo, nel quale è dipinto un Gesù rito colle gambe nel sepolcro, e colle braccia aperte, e dietro ad esso è la Croce, sulla quale par, che stia appoggiato: quel che è scritto nel quadro dice così:          AL NOME DI DIO AMEN. QUEST E LA CONPAGNIA MAGIORE FATTA EDIFICATA PER NOBILE SAN PIETRO MARTIRE AD ONORE E REVERENZIA DELLA NOSTRA GLORIOSA MADRE VERGINE MARIA NELL ANNO MCCXLIIII IL DI DELLA SENSIONE E FA DIRE ONGNI GIOVEDI LA MESSA DELLA PACE E CHI E DI QUESTA CONPANGNIA A TRE AN. E CCCXX DI DI PERDONANZA E DA PIEDO SARANNO TUTTE LE PERDONANZE LE QUALI SONO CONCEDUTE A LA DETTA COMPANGNIA IN PRIMA E VESCOVI DI FIRENZE MESSER GIOVANNI E MESSER GOTTIFREDI E MESER FRANCESCHO CONCEDETONO A LA DETTA COMPAGNIA DUE ANNI E CCC DI DI PERDONO APRESSO I VENERABOLI FRATI GENERALI E MAGIORI E L’ORDINE PREDICATORI EMMORI (cioè e minori) E ROMITANI E CARMINO E MONACI E DI TUTTI GLI ORDINI CONCEDETONO CHE FOSONO PARTEFICI A TUTTI I BENI CHE SI FACESSE PER TUTTO IL MONDO VIVI E MORTI.</p>

<p>XV.	(288) La parte opposta, o dir vogliamo il rovescio è tutto dipinto, essendovi nel triangolo la Madonna nel mezzo col Bambino in collo, alla cui destra sta S. Pier Martire con un giglio in mano, e alla sinistra S. Franesco, che tiene un libro. Nello spazio sottoposto del quadro, S. Pier Martire (dietro al quale è il frate suo Compagno) consegna lo Stendardo ad uno, che è inginocchiato a’suoi piedi in atto di ricerverlo, e gli altri cogli Stendardi già ricevuti sta ritti a dirimpetto con abito talare, ma di diversi colori. Tutta questa pittura pare della scuola di Giotto, cioè di alcuno de’suoi Scolari, e qui ne diamo una copia.</p>

<p>XVI.	Parlando d’altra pittura consimile, che è sopra uno degli Archi, nominai lo Stendardo, che si conserva in Santa Maria Novella, aggiungo ora, che è di tela rada di lino, che rassomiglia il filondente, ed è rattoppato. Nulla dimeno vi ha chi non crede esser l’antico. Avrei da dirle alcune altre cose da me osservate, ma gliele portrò un giorno comunicare in voce. Son con vero ossequio:   Di Casa 5 Maggio 1755   Suo Devotissimo Servitor Angio Maria Ricci.</p>

<p>XVII.	Degli Scrittori soprallodati, pregiatissimi per vero dire sono i documenti, e insieme utilissimi, onde stabilire la verità della Storia. Ma perchè sopra alcune cose riferite da i ricordati Scrittori ne possono nascere gravi dubbiezze, mi farò dal punto il più difficile, ma essenziale, qual è l’origine delle due Compagnie, vale a dire della Compagnia maggiore di Maria Vergine chiamata poi del Bigallo, e della Compagnia detta della Misericordia vecchia, standosi forte in dubbio, se dal principio queste due Compagnie fossero una sola, o almeno, come io credo, tra se presto unitesi, (289) poichè amendue riconoscevano per Fondatore San Pier Martire. Per l’opinione negative son il suddetto Ambrogi, e Rosselli, e molti altri: per l’affirmativa trovasi Leopoldo del Migliore nella Firenze Illustrata, dove dice a c. 78 come segue, “E qui si deve avvertire, prima di passer avanzi, che doppo quest’unione come d’altri dodici spedali raccomandati sotto alla medesima cura seguì il dividersene le ragioni in due Corpi destinti, uno sotto il medessimo nome, e titolo di S. Maria del Bigallo alias di San Pier Martrie, e l’altro di S. Maria della Misericordia, ambidue al governo di Capitani. Il che sperimentatosi con lungo andare uno servare, e tor di vita la virtù, corroborante l’unioni delle cose, e per tale conosciutosi da Padri, arrivata che fù la Repubblica felicemente all’Anno 1425 in cui par più che in altro tempo, i Fiorentini non combattuti dall’eiterne, e disastrose brighe di Guerra sostero intenti fuor di modo a riaccomodar lo stato loro, e l’interne direzioni della Città appoggiate al giudiziio delle Leggi, si deliberò in Senato, che le predette due Compagnie si riunistero insieme sotto un medesimo nome di S. Maria del Bigallo, da governarsi da otto Capitani risendenti collegialmente a guisa di Magistrato, e che un segno esteriore ne fosse l’Armi loro ridotte in uno Scudo solo diviso per lo lungo in parte, da una la Croce rossa in Campo nero con un F, e dall’altra un M d’oro dalle bande, e dall’altra un Gallo bianco in azzurro con lettere sotto S.M.B.”</p>

<p>XVIII.	Ora questa opinione io penso di appigliarmi sul riflesso, che così meglio si dichiarao parecchie cose difficili, come per esempio le pitture di S. Pier Martire fatta da Taddeo Gaddi nella facciata esteriore dell’Oratorio, dalla banda, che guarda San Giovanni, delle quali con maggiore facilità ne intendiamo il fine di chi le ffece colorire, cioè la Compagnia in onore del Santo suo fondatore, laddove se ci allontaniamo dal parere del Migiore, e vogliamo distinte, e separata le Compagnie, il Bigallo non avrebbe potuto far lavorare dal Gaddi le dette dipinture, mentrechè non prima dell’anno 1425 diventò il Bigallo unico Padrone di questo luogo, nè poteva comandare tal (290) fattura sopra casa non sua, ma che era della Compagnia della Misericordia, e però ogni altro Santo si arebbe fatto da essa dipignere: In tal guise ancora noi combiniamo la varietà degli Scrittori nell’assengare l’anno della fondazione del Bigallo, volendo alcuni che fosse il 1240 ed altri il 44 che se giudichiamo le due suddette Compagnie ne’primi anni unite, possiamo stabilire nel 40  prinicpiata una di esse, ed ivi pure l’altra nel 44 e sullo stesso sistema troviamo la cagione perchè la Signoria nel 1352 per contratto rogato da Ser Piero di Ser Grifo ne’ 28 di Giugno, desse al Bigallo, terreno per fabbricarsi la sua Residenza là vicino a S. Bartolo al Corso, done se ne deduce forte congettura, che appunto in quell’anno 52 o in quell torno si separassero, giusta il Migliore, le due Compagnie, altrimenti siamo costretti a dire, che la Compagnia del Bigallo per cento, e più anni non avesse mai avuto casa in Firenze. E se abbiamo detto di sopra, che I Capitani di essa si radunaveano ora in un luogo della Città, ed ora in altro, da ciò non sembra buona illuzione il dire, che non avessero propria Residenza, imperciocchè andavano in varie Chiese, o di loro dipendenza, o da essi beneficiate in certe occasioni di fare varie provvisioni; ed io ne ho una presso di me fatta da’detti Capitani in Santa Maria sul Prato, che dice come segue: “1297 15 Aug. Nos Mazzottus Bacherelli, Bartolus Ugolini, Ser Ciprianus 4 Riccomanni, Ser Guido Spadaccii, Folchardinus Bonsignori, Ubaldinus Ardinghelli, Guido Ramaglianti, &amp; Vieri Arrussi Rectores, sive Capitanei maioris Societatis B. M. Virginis, una cum Corteccione fil. q. Iohannes de Rusticis corum consortia in ipso officio apud Monast. Sororum S. Marie del Prato Flor. Ipsa die solemnitatis B. V. congregate, concesserunt Corteccioni pred. plenam licentiam, &amp; liberum mandatum dandi, &amp; concedendi Ecclesiam del Castagno, &amp; locum, quem bactenus tenebant Fr Humilis, &amp; Fr. Michael pro ipsa Societate posit. in Monte Basciano prope Cavas de Verzaia etc.” a chi l’avesse volute; (291) e se si fosse dato il caso, che quelli, a chi fosse stata conceduta la Chiesa, e il luogo, si partissero, vollero, che ipso facto l’uno, e l’altro luogo alla Compagnia Maggiore ritornasse. Ego Rusticus Not. Q. Ugonis.</p>

<p>XIX.	Altro dubbio ora ci occorre da illustrare, riguardante l’Oratorio, che non è assai certo su qual terreno, e quando fosse fabbricato, dicendo a questo proposito l’Ambrogi, che la Compagnia della Misericordia antichissima, comperò alcune Case da Baldinaccio degli Adimari sopra la Piazza di San Giovanni, e su di esse edificasse ella il suo Oratorio, e Residenza: ma Leopoldo del Migliore a c. 81 diversamente la discorre come appresso, “in su la cantonata è l’Oratorio della Misericordia vecchia, situate appunto dove fu già la Torre del Guardamorto, e la Stanza pubblica all’esposizione de’Cadaveri,” e dal medesimo ivi dicesi, che la detta Torre rovinata che su, fosse conceduta dalla Repubblica a San Pietro da Verona per trasferirvi la sua novella Compagnia, da I cui Capitani fu il luogo ridotto ad uso di Oratorio, e di Residenza. Uniformamente al Migliore scrisse pure il Rosselli nella sua memoria, tendo egli per cosa certa, che sopra il sito della suddetta Torre fosse eretto l’Oratorio, ed al sentiment di amendue favorevole sarrebbe la pianta del sotterraneo, avente muraglie grossissime, ed un barbacane stupendo, i quali non furono murati certamente per servizio dell’Oratorio, che essendo di mediocre altezza, non richiedeva somiglianti fondamenta. E per dirre alcunchè dell’anno della erezione dell’Oratorio del Bigallo, noteremo qui l’abbaglio preso primieramente da parecchi, che scrisseroessersi principiata la detta Fabbrica nel 1240 o al più 44 posciachè abbiamo da Ricordano Malespini a pag 123 e da Giovanni Villani a pag. 177 che solamente nel 1248 cadesse detta Torre, e le parole del Villani sono le sequenti, “Ancora mostrarono maggiore ampiezza per cagione, che e’Guelfi faceano di loro molto capo alla Chiesa, et Duomo di S. Giovanni (292) et tutta la buona gente usava quivi la Domenica mattina, e faceanuisi molti matrimoni. Quando vennero a disfare la fortezza de’Guelfa (cioè le Torri) intra l’altre un’alta, et bella Torre, che era in su la Piazza di S. Giovanni all’entrare nel Corso degli Adimari, la quale si chiamava la Torre del Guardamorto, perchè anticamente tutta la buona gente che moriva, si seppelliva a S. Giovanni, i Ghibellini facendo tagliar da piè della detta Torre (da Niccola Pisano) sì la fecero puntellare per modo, che quando si mettesse fuoco ne’puntelli cadesse sopra il Duomo di San Giovanni, et arsi i puntelli, come piacque a Dio, et a Messer Santo Giovanni, cadde la Torre per lo mezzo della Piazza, et apparve manifestamente, che la Torre si ravvolse, e schifo di non cadere, dove haveano ordinato, la qual Torre era alta CXX braccia.” Quindi si fa ragione, che non solamente vicinissima fosse la detta Torre a S. Giovanni, ma che non prima del 1248 anno della vendetta sacrilege de’Ghibellini, non poteva il Bigallo aver principiato il suo edifizio sulle rovine delle Torri, la cui demolizione arrecò a Niccola Pisano lode di grande Architetto. E dale suddette Notizie chiaro appare lo sbaglio di un Diario, che trovo tra le Scritture del Rondinelli, che scrisse, “1411 si fabbrica l’Oratorio del Bigallo sul canto del Corso de’Brigliai.” Oltredichè il lavoro esterno di questo Oratorio o sieno le colonnette, o l’arco, o i rilievi, dichiarano manifestamente questo esser fabbrica di maniera più antica.</p>

<p>XX.	Quando poi la Compagnia di Santa Maria del Bigallo, e della Misericordia, cessato il titolo dei Capitani, diventasse un cospicuo Magistrato di Firenze, il cui principale ufizio è la sollecita cura, e governo degli Abbandonati, nella prima lezione ne siamo andati istruiti, ma notar qui mi giova, che nell’antico ancora dalla Repubblica furono al Bigallo raccomandati i Fanciulli, e Fanciulle o smarrite o derelitte, come ne parlano varie Provvisioni del Comune, (293) e lo Statuto Fiorentino sotto la rubric 117 del libro 3 con le seguenti parole: Quicumque invenerit aliquos Pueros, vel puellas vagantes sine custodia, reneatur representare, &amp; assignare in Platea Orti S. Michaelis, vel apud Domam Misericordie ufficiali deputato per dictum Commune; e da Fra Domenico da Corella così ne fu scritto circa al 1460 nel suo Theotocon: Unde pusilla mihi Domus est adeunda Marie Proxima que nomen Commiserantis habet. Hec tenet ambiguo Pueros errore vagantes Ne patria pereat nescia turba laris. Tuta sed hec fido maneat sub culmine, donec Reddantur patribus pignora chara suis. Talis enim nostra mos hic servatur in Urbe Preferri religuis que pietate solet.</p>

<p>XXI.	E già schiariti i prinicipali punti della Storia, non sarà certamente disconveniente cosa l’accennare qui per fine alcune dipinture intra lasciate dal Sig. Proposto Dottore Angelo Maria Ricci, perchè non pertinenti al suo Oratorio, dove Egli è capo di una piccolo, ma riguardevole Collegiata. E però consideramo una pittura grande sopra il Portone al di fuori dipinta a fresco, rappresentante in varie, e belle attitudini, dove molti Fanciulli smarriti, e dove delle Madri chi afflitta per la perdita del figlio, e chi in aria allegra per vederselo restituire da’Capitani del Bigallo, veggendosi in tale dipintura molte case, e Torri all’uso di que’tempi, cioè del 1444 come trovasi notato al lib. X pag. 8 nell’Archivio del medesimo Bigallo, dove si legge anche il nome del Pittor e dice, 1444 1 Iunii Capitanei S. Marie virginis, &amp; Misericordie del Bigallo &amp;c ordinano pagarsi diversi obblighi del loro Spedale etc. Item Piero Chellino Pictori proresto totius sue Picture facte in Domo habitationis Captineorum in facie exteriori. Nell’andito dell’Udienza sonovi alquante Pitturre vetuste, come quelle che occupano tutta la parete addirimpetto alla Porta del Magistrato, ma (294) così annerite, e guaste, che non è sperabile l’arrivare ad intenderle: sul piano della scala, che con due braccia conduce al piano superior, vedesi un Cristo ritto(?) nel Sepolcro, colle braccia aperte, tenente nel seno una moltitudine di gente per esprimere la Misericordia, e sotto due Cartelli di caratieri gottici, che dicono: O VOI GENTE, CHE PER VIA PASSATE, INTRATE DENTRO, E QVI RIGVARDATE IL MIO FIGLVOLO IN CROCE POSTO PE’ VOSTRI PECCATI È COSÌ MORTO. SE VOI DE’ PECCATI VI PENTETE MISERICORDIA DA LVI AVRETE. O PECCATORI PERCHÈ NON PIAGIETE I VOSTRI PECCATI CHE QVI VEDETE MORTO IL NOSTRO SIGNOR GESÙ CRISTO CHE PER VOI SALVARE FV CROCIFISSO QVALVNQVE COLLVI VORRÀ CONCORDIA PRIEGHI LA MADRE DI MISERICORDIA.</p>

<p>XXII.	E a manritta di questa porta viene una parimente antichissima pittura a fresco, ed una Figura giagantesca della Misericordia espresso in una Persona ammantata di Piviale con Mitra tonda in capo, e Stolone fino a i piedi, nella quale Stola veggonsi alcuni ovati, in cui sono effigiate le Opere della Misericordia con lettere longobarde. Questa figura sta in aria in atto maestoso di padrona, sopra a Firenze dipintale sotto col Popolo inginocchioni, e chi bramasse sapere qual fosse il secondo Cerchio della Città, o veda quivi delineato. Il Pittore di questa Tavola spiegò la sua idea con le sequenti lettere mezze gottiche, ma rifiorite sull’antiche, e dicono; OMNIS MISERICORDIA FACIET LOCVM VNICVIQVE SECVNDVM MERITVM OPERVM SVORVM, ET SEVNDVM INTELLECTVM PEREGRINATIONIS ILLIVS ANNO MCCCLII. (295) Uscendo da questo loggetta a man destra sono nel muro numero sei arpioni alti dal piano degli scalini due in tre braccia, de’quali s’ha certa tradizione, che servissero per attaccarvi la Cattedra, quando San Pier Martire predicava in su questa Piazza; della qual cosa non avendo altra autenticazione, che il detto di qualche Persona antica, mi basterà di averlo qui accennato, lasciando a ciascuno giudicare come gli piace. E sua Porta dell’Udienza, oltre l’arme de’Granduchi evvi un Cartello contenente a caratteri d’oro queste lettere: SERENISS. COSMO MAGNO D. HETRVRIAE XII. VIRI CVM CERTIS PIETATIS MINISTERIIS ET PVPRIS DERELICTIS CVM ALIQVA ECCLESIAST. DIGNIT. PERSONA. COLLIGENDIS ET CVRANDIS PRAEFECTI.</p>

<p>XXIII.	E qui mi si conceda di por fine a questa istoria, col riferire smmariamente tutti gli anni delle Pestilenze in Firenze, e suo Contado, e per conseguente i tanti prodigi di carità operati dalla Compagnia nostra in quelle stragi, e fuesti apparati di morte. La prima vi succeed nel 1325 cagionata dalla Guerra di Altopascio, la seconda nel 1340 nella quale i morti furono il sesto de i Cittadini, la maggior parte nobili; sette anni dopo seguì la terza, e nell’anno seguente 1348 venne la pestilenza chiamata la Peste grande, la quale uccise centomila anime, nel cui numero annoversari Giovanni Villani famoso Storiografo, e Matteo fratello di Giovanni ci fu tolto dalla peste del 1363 e due altre ne furono in quell’infelice secolo, cioè nel 1374 e nel 1383. Ritornò nel 1400 detta la peste de’Bianchi, che erano certe Compagnie, che andavano pellegrinando, e vi restarono quasi tutti morti; la nona fu nel 1411 e la decima venne nel 1417 con 16 mila morti. Altra di pochissima durata fuvvi nel 22 e somiglianti nel 30 e nel 37. Una poi chiamata l’Anguinata nel 1449 fu grande, massimamente nel Contado, a questa succeede nel 65 la XVI e la XVII (296) nel 79 nella quale trovatosi Marsilio Ficino, scrisse quell celebre libro intitolato: La cura della Peste, contenente ottime istruzioni. Di tre altre nel 95, 98, e 1509 non ne abbiamo particolarità: fierissima però, e lunghissima fu quella del 1525 sino al 1527 dicendone il Varchi, fece strage quasi di Uomini infiniti. Dopo questa vise la Città centotrè anni libera da tal flagella, quando nel 1630 il contagioso male scopertosi a Milano, e picchiate le Porte a Bologna, a gran passi venne a Firenze, ed in tutto il tempo del male occupatissima fu ne’suoi esercizi di Misericordia la Compagnia, che in que’tempi addimandavasi, come oggi, la Misericordia nuova, la quale si guadagnò tanta venerazione, che passando per le vie, anche terminata la peste, sentivasi rimbombare di lode l’aria. Viva viva la Compagnia della Misericordia. Non fu però questa Pestilenza l’ultima, avvegnachè nel 1633 facesse ritorno, ma dale diligenze del Granduca Ferdinando, che mise tutta la Città in quarantine, presto sparì, e per vero dire, dagli esempi posteriori non può negarsi, che la salute dell’Italia nostra non si riconosca dall’amore, potere, e diligenza de’Principi.</p>
