                <p>Luigi Passerini, Curiosità storico-artistiche Fiorentine (Florence, 1866), 91-98.</p>

<h2 id="the-loggia-of-the-bigallo">The Loggia of the Bigallo</h2>
<p>Among the most praiseworthy decisions made by the rulers of Tuscany in the wake of the dismantling of the Austro-Lorraine dynasty was the one to reopen the loggia of the Bigallo on the square of the Duomo. After a few years of waiting, the desires of the people were realized through the wise direction of the architect Mariano Falcini, whose restoration work can still be seen in the upper sections of the building. I believe it is important to reveal information I have uncovered about this building and its artistic value.</p>

<p>This elegant loggia was built by the Captains of the Misericordia for the purpose both of celebrating the charity of the city [which supported the foster home of the Bigallo] and of alerting the public to the fate of those children who, abandoned in the streets, were reunited with the same inhuman parents who came to collect them. I have already addressed the issues of when and how the institution was born, as well as its primitive purpose, in my work on Charitable institutions published in 1853 by Le Monnier; and here I would like to note that recent archival discoveries have confirmed that the Society of the Misericordia was formed after the plague of 1326 by members of the Company of the Laudesi of the Virgin of Orsanmichele, which contradicts the fairy tales invented by the priest Lorenzo Fici in 1605 and repeated by other writers who have examined this pious place.</p>

<p>The rectors of the benevolent association, made rich in 1348 thanks to the legacies it received, maintained a stable place to exercise those works of piety that were appropriate in their institution. To this end, considering the opportunity of building on their site – donated to them by Giovanni d’Albizzo Pellegrini on 16 September 1354 – the rectors considered building a chapel and some rooms in a structure on the Piazza S. Giovanni. However, the site seemed too cramped for such a building and rectors beseeched the Florentines for additional space. On January 21 of the following year (1355) the commune and people of Santa Reparata gave them an additional 10 braccie (about six meters) of territory on the corner of the Corso Adimari, which they used to build their oratory.[1]</p>

<p>This is the most accurate date for the building: Vasari incorrectly attributed the design to the hand of Nicola Pisano, who had already been dead for a century when the building was actually constructed. We do not know the name of the architect, but it is not unlikely that Andrea Orcagna had a part in it, because the style of the building closely matches his own: but this can not be determined with certainty, due to the fact that we have lost the books from the Capitani della Misericordia that record transactions between 1352 and 1358. The construction of the loggia was completed in 1358, and in that year they closed the arches with iron gates, made by Francesco Petrucci, a famous Sienese artist known for other works of a similar kind: and these little gates could not have been of poor quality when installed, for their maker was paid the conspicuous sum of 55 gold florins.[2] At the same time Alberto Arnoldi carved for the altar of the chapel the statue of Virgin Mary and the two angels at her side; and this work produced between 1359 and 1364 was produced by a member of the illustrious school of Andrea Pisano who received 280 gold florins. He (Alberto Arnoldi) simultaneously produced the other image of the Madonna, placed on the door beside the oratory there in the piazza di San Giovanni, which he finished in June of 1361 for 16 gold florins. Even this report was misconstrued by Vasari, who judged these sculptures as the work of Andrea Pisano and his chief assistant, Ciognara, which I noted in my abovementioned book.[3]</p>

<p>The Captain’s records recount the funding of fresco paintings that decorated the vaults of the chapel in 1363, which were produced by the two painters Nardo and Bartolommeo. The first of these was probably the brother of Andrea Orcagna (Nardo di Cione), and the other was the Sienese painter named Bartolommeo, believed to be the same Bulgarini who performed many works in the city of Florence. In addition to these paintings, Giunta and Rossello later painted works in 1425, and others were executed on the walls by Giovanni di Donnino in 1436.[4] I do not know the subject or even the form of these paintings because they are not described in the aforementioned books, and now they can no longer be seen as they were hidden from view by the plaster that was laid on as a whitewash coat in 1760, ordered by the rector at that time named Angiolo Maria Ricci in an attempt to highlight the baroque ornaments more recently executed by Stefano Fabbrini. Today we protest this barbarism: but our ancestors did not think so, as that was the taste of that century.</p>

<p>While they painted the vaults, they hired a painter named Ambrogio, perhaps Lorenzetti or Baldesi: but that is not what is currently seen on the altar, because this work was replaced in 1512 by a remarkable altarpiece painted by Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio and made with beautiful relief carvings by Antonio Carota, a famous artist at that time.</p>

<p>Records in the Captain’s account books indicate that Niccolò di Piero Gerini and Ambrose di Baldese, arriving in 1386, painted on the exterior wall of the oratory that beautiful fresco that is now displayed in the room of the Commissioner of the orphanage S. Maria del Bigallo. The fresco, which was transferred there in 1777, represents on one side a group of children being separated from their parents and, on the other, joyful mothers receiving the children they had previously abandoned to the care of the brothers of the Misericordia.[5]</p>

<p>It is well known that the benefices and privileges given to the Company by the whole city would not be enough to prevent the ruin of the pious association. Despite by the protection of Cosimo the Elder of the Medici, the poor management of the confraternity threatened its solvency, and in 1425 two confraternities joined to form one, in a way that enhanced the revenues of the Misericordia in ways from which Cosimo could benefit. As a natural consequence, the former duties of the Misericordia were ceased. When, after many years, it was deemed important to revive it to a new life, the memory of Cosimo’s intrigues caused the commune in 1489 to abolish the ability of private citizens to interfere with the interests of the charitable institution.</p>

<p>Turning now to the artistic issues that surround this place, we learn that the new masters of the recomposed confratnernity, the Capitani del Bigallo – perhaps to erase the memory of their usurpation of the Misericordia in 1425 – moved to decorate the outer walls of the palace above the oratory with paintings that represented a more favorable account of these facts. They did so when, after a disasterous fire damaged the oratory on July 23, 1442, the captains rebuilt most of the upper half of the building. The paintings have never been correctly interpreted: Lastri, Rosselli, and Landini attributed them to Taddeo Gaddi, but were understandably confused by their style which seem consistent with other pictures of the time. Richa, Rumhor and Becchi mistakenly ascribed them to Piero Chellini, who did indeed work for the Bigallo, but more as a whitewasher than an artist (as I demonstrated in my book on Florentine charity, in which I cited the documents that reveal that Ventura di Moro and Rossello di Iacopo of Scolaio Franchi were the authors of these frescoes in 1445.[6]
Here we bring to a close our discussion of this place, not wishing to examine the adjacent building or the works of Filippo di Cristofano, Ambrose di Baldese and Mariotto di Nardo, who painted unusual pictures there: all of this material I have published in my book on the charities of this city on pages 9, 150 and following.</p>

<hr />

<p>[1] In the 1354th year of our Lord’s incarnation, on January 21, Mr. Giovanni, son of Sir Piero the surveyor of the commune, and Mr. Tomaso di Iacopo di Passero, master of the commune, in the presence of Mr. Bartolo, the procurator of the major church of Florence, and other priests and dignitaries, in order to build an oratory on the corner of the Piazza di San Giovanni, give ten braccie of territory (give or take some space) from the primary area of the via degli Adimari, next to the column of the house adjacent to the said building. They declare this and bid the notary Ser Matteo di Gherardo da Panico to write down the agreement (see Florence, Archivio di Stato, Bigallo, Libro II of Delib. e Stanziamenti, fascicolo I, carte 28).</p>

<p>[2] In the 1358th year of our Lord’s incarnation, on 9 March, Manetto di Giovanni Davanzati paid 55 gold florins to Francesco Petrucci da Siena for the iron gates of the oratory of the said company – Archivio centrale di Stato, Bigallo, Deliberazioni dei Capitano II, II, carte 7.</p>

<p>[3] 1359, indiction 15, 18th day of June: Filippo di Bartolo Filippi, Rusticho Donati, Filippo del Nero, Davanzato Iohanni (Davanzati), Giovanni di Firenze, e Francesco di Pero captions of this confratnerity, in their name and on half of their compatriots, deliberated on the following things: First, they agreed to offer to Alberto Arnoldo, master from the parish of San Michele Berteldi, the commission to produce an image in marble of Our Lady holding her Son in her arms in an act of mercy, decorated and adorned in gold and lustrious colors as is appropriate, with two angels: the Madonna should be at least three braccie tall (roughly 1.5 meters) and the two angels at least two and half braccie tall (roughly 1.25 meters). All of these figures must be by the hand of Alberto, who shall receive a salary of 55 florins for the figure of our Lady and one hundred thirty florins for the two angels, who should be holding candles in their hands: the figure of Mary should be of a higher quality than the figure of Our Lady in Pisa. Its quality will be judged by three or four masters deemed to be qualified by the city of Florence, which shall appoint them at the time. And if it is deemed to be inferior to the one in Pisa, the Bigallo will not be obligated to keep it. And the images of the marble angels must be of the same quality and beauty of the said figure of Mary. He will be paid in the following manner: he will recieve an initial payment of one hundred gold florins, and when the figure of Our Lady has been completed to our satisfaction he will have fifty gold florins, and when he has completed the angels he will receive fifty gold florins; he will compose and install in the oratory the figures at his own expense. And the figures will be completed in two years from the time of their initiation, as indicated by the date of the first payment of one hundred florins. See the statement notarized by Ser Tino (aforementioned book, carte 12).  1364, 16 August. They met and absolved the master Alberto Arnoldi and his son, Alesso, of wrongdoing in the production of the figures of Our Lady and angels, and they declared him to be in accord with the agreement made, and they asked me to check the contract and all the agreements, which I annulled and canceled (see carte 57). 1361, indiction 14, 25 June. They deliberated and decided to send the company’s administator (burser) to pay the debt of 16 gold florins to the master Alberto Arnoldo as final payment for the figure and marble image of Our Lady holding her blessing son at her breast, which was positioned over the portal of the oratory.</p>

<p>[4] 1363, 24 June. The captains directed the administrator to pay the painter, Bartolommeo, 62 lire, 4 sold, and 6 denari for pictures at the head of the oratory (see carte 37).  1363, 24 October. The Captains of the Misericordia – Statio Dati, Tellino Dino, Piero Borsi, Duccio di Giovanni, Ruberto Martelli – in the name of the confraternity and the company, discussed a number of things listed below. First they discussed the work in the Oratory where one sees figures, that is on the face of the pedestal made by the master Ambrogio that is designed and made as well as is possible; for the best value, make sure we don’t spend more than 100 gold florins.
They also discussed the work that they want done by Nardo the painter for the price of forty florins, in that form that Tino wants; in these things they directed me to make a contract to hire them.</p>

<p>[5] 1386, 5 July. The Captains of the Misericordia - Giovanni Federighi, Nuto di Francesco, Giusto di Coverello, Soldo di Lippo Soldani, Francesco di Lutozzo (Nasi), e Iacopo del Riccio, minus the absent Tommaso di Francesco – gave to the painters Niccolò di Piero and Ambrogio di Baldese, on June 22, seventeen gold florins for the completion of work on the paintings on the facade of the front of the Residence of the Misericordia, as appears in this book of entries (see book 3, carte 27 verso).</p>

<p>[6] 1446 – Ventura di Moro, painter, received four florins on 27 May, as appears in the fourth book of accounts by Giovanni da Filicaia, our administator, on carte 108. And on the 28th of August fifteen florins were given to Rossello the painter for finishing half of the painting for the company of the history of Saint Peter Martyr on the facade of our company, as written down by our Syndicate, Lorenzo di Bartolommeo the painter (Archivio di Stato, Libro dei debitori e creditori del Bigallo del 1446 e 1447, G, carte 10. The pictures by Chellini must be those made to ornament the elegant windows at the top of the oratory’s loggia, that the master restored from the antique when it was last left in a poor state. Here’s the relative item: 1343, 10 March: The painter Piero Cellini and his followers may receive payment for the favorable execution of pictures; twenty lire for the procurement of lime and materials for scaffolding – Deliberazioni dei Capitani del Bigallo, 1443 e 1444, filza VI, carte 10). And I must add to this preceeding statement, noted not by me but by Rumhor and Becchi – 1444, June 1, Piero Chellini painter for restoring pictures on the facade of the residence of the Captains.</p>

<h2 id="la-loggetta-del-bigallo">La Loggetta del Bigallo</h2>
<p>Fu lodevole pensiero di chi reggeva le sorti della Toscana dopo la partenza della dinastia Austro-Lorenese quello di riaprire la loggetta che dicesi del Bigallo, sulla piazza del Duomo: e dopo alcuni anni di espettativa sono stati coronati i voti comuni, vedendosi finalmente compiuto, in parte, il lavoro sotto la sapiente direzione dell’architetto Mariano Falcini, abbenchè resti ancora farsi il restauro del soprastante edifizio. Collegandosi a questo luogo non poche memorie artistiche, non stimo opera inutile lo esporre tutto quello che mi è stato concesso di ritrovare relativo a tale monumento.</p>

<p>Questa elegante loggetta fu edificata dai Capitani di S. Maria della Misericordia all’oggetto di esporvi alla pubblica pietà quei fanciulli che, abbandonati per le vie, da essi si raccoglievano per tentare se modo vi fosse di riconoscere gl’inumani genitori, ed anche per sollecitare la carità cittadina a loro vantaggio. Quando e come nascesse la pia istituzione, qual fosse il primitive suo scopo, esposi in un mio lavoro sugli’istituti di beneficenza edito nel 1853 coi tipi del Le Monnier: e qui mi piace di ripetere, poichè ne ho avuta conferma dai documenti posteriormente trovati, che non m’ingannai, asserendo la Compagnia della Misericordia nata dai Laudesi della Vergine di Orsanmichele in occasione della peste del 1326, e che sono favole i racconti immaginati dal prete Lorenzo Fici nel 1605 e ripetuti da quanti scrissero sulla origine del luogo pio.</p>

<p>I rettori del benefico sodalizio, fatti ricchi pei lasciti conseguiti nel 1348, pensarono ad avere un luogo stabile di residenza per esercitare quelle opere di pietà ch’erano proprie del loro istituto. Al quale oggetto, pensando alla opportunità del locale, deliberarono di costruire una cappella ed alcune stanza sulla piazza di S. Giovanni, valendosi della casa che aveva ad essi donata Giovanni d’Albizzo Pellegrini, il 16 settembre 1354, nell’atto di costituirsi loro servo per tutta la vita. Ma parendo ad essi troppo angusto quel luogo, sollecitarono la pietà dei Fiorentini; nè vi ricorsero invano, avvengnachè ottennero dai poplani di S. Reparata altre dieci braccia di terreno sul canto del Corso degli Adimari, il 21 gennaio dell’anno appresso, affinchè vi potessero costruire il loro oratorio.[1]</p>

<p>Questa è la data più precisa dell’edifizio: laondo mal si appone il Vasari, ascrivendolo tra le opere di Niccolò Pisano già morto da un secolo. Ignorasi chi ne fu l’architetto, ma non è improbabile che vi avesse parte Andrea Orcagna, perchè lo stile dell’edifizio molto si acosta a quello ch’era proprio di lui: nè mai potrà determinarsi con sicurezza, mancando tra i libri dei Capitani della Misericordia tutti quelli che vanno dai primi mesi del 1352 al 1358. La costruzione della loggia era compiuta nel 1358, ed in quell’anno se ne chiudevano le arcate con cancelli di ferro, che facevansi da Francesco Petrucci, celebre artista senese noto per altri lavori di simil genere: e quelle cancellate non dovevano certamente essere povera cosa quando pagavansi all’artefice la somma, allora cospicua, di 55 fiorini d’oro.[2] Contemporaneamente Alberto Arnoldi scolpiva per l’altare della cappella la statua di Maria vergine ed i due angeli che le stanno ai lati; e questa opera conducevasi dall’illustre scolare di Andrea Pisano tra il 1359 ed il 1364, ricevendone prezzo di 280 fiorini d’oro: mentre lavorava nel tempo istesso all’altra immagine della Madonna che posa sulla porta di fianco dell’oratorio, nella piazza di S. Giovanni, la quale diè finita nel giugno del 1361 per 16 fiorini d’oro. Anche rapporto a questo fu tratto in errore il Vasari, giudicando queste scolture opera di Andrea Pisano: della qual cosa recò prova il Cicognara prima di ogni altro, ed a quelle altre io ne aggiunsi nel mio libro sopra citato, che qui, come in luogo più conveniente, riporto.[3]</p>

<p>Gli stanziamenti dei Capitani conservano memoria delle pitture a fresco colle quali decoravansi le volte della cappella nel 1363, a cui attendevano i due dipintori Nardo e Bartolommeo: il primo dei quali fu assai probabilmente il fratello di Andrea Orcagna, e l’altro il senese Bartolommeo, creduto dei Bulgarini, che assai opere eseguì nella città di Firenze. A queste debbono aggiungersi quelle che in epoca assai posteriore, nel 1425, dipingevano Giunta e Rossello, e le altre che furono eseguite sulle pareti da Giovanni di Donnino nel 1436.[4] Non mi è noto il soggetto e neppure la forma di cotali pitture, perchè nei rammentati libri non si descrivono: ed ora non più possono vedersi, essendo nascosto dall’intonaco che vi distese sopra un imbianchino nel 1760, d’ordine d’Angiolo Maria Ricci allora rettore dell’Oratoria; a cui parve che miglior figura dovessero fare i barocchi ornati che vi fece eseguire da Stefano Fabbrini. Noi gridiamo alla barbarie: ma i nostri vecchi non pensavano cosi, e quello era il gusto del secolo.</p>

<p>Mentre essi dipingevano le volte, si faceva il gradino da un pittore nomato Ambrogio, forse il Lorenzetti o il Baldesi: ma non è quello chè si ammira attualmente sull’altare, perche questo, opera tra le più pregevoli di Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio, fu sostituito all’antico nel 1512, allorquando fu costruito il nuovo altare ricco dei belli intagli da Antonio Carota celebre artista in quel tempo.</p>

<p>Si ha memoria nei libri di uscita dei Capitani che Niccolò di Piero Gerini e Ambrogio di Baldese, volgendo il 1386, dipingevano sulla parete esterna dell’oratorio quel bell’affresco che ora si ammira nella stanza in cui risiede il Commissario dell’attiguo orfanotrofio di S. Maria del Bigallo, là trasferito nel 1777, rappresentante alcuni fanciulli smarriti, e tra essi diverse madri tutte festanti per vederseli restituiti dai confratelli di S. Maria della Misericordia.[5]</p>

<p>È noto come i benefizi impartiti alla intiera città non bastassero ad impedire la rovina del pio sodalizio; avvegnachè Cosimo il vecchio dei Medici, protettore della Compagnia del Bigallo, la quale per effeto di mala amministrazione era prossima a sciogliersi, fece di maniera che nel 1425 delle due fraternite se ne formasse una sola, per potere coi redditi della Misericordia arricchire quella di cui voleva vantaggiare gl’interessi. Com’era naturale conseguenza del fatto, cessò l’esercizio delle opere pie ch’erano proprie della Misericordia; e quando dopo molti anni si rese indispensabile di richimarla a novella vita, quei che ne dettarono i nuovi statui, nel 1489, memori dei danni arrecati da Cosimo Medici, decretarono in modo che l’autorità e l’influenza dei cittadini statuali fosse minima nel luogo pio.</p>

<p>Tornando ora alle notizie artistiche de questo luogo, debbo notare che i nuovi padroni, i Capitani del Bigallo, forse per cancellare la memore della loro usurpazione, vollero rappresentati sulle pareti esterne del palagetto sovrastante all’oratorio i fatti relativi alla loro istituzione, e vi si decisero allorquando si trovarono astretti a riedificare in gran parte la metà superiore dell’edifizio danneggiato da un furioso incendio il 23 luglio 1442. Il Lastri, il Rosselli, e il Landini attribuiscono quelle pitture a Taddeo Gaddi, ma basta per confutarli il conoscere il tempo nel quale furono condotte: Richa, Rumhör e Becchi le danno a un Piero Chellini, ma sono anch’essi in errore. Lavorò invero questo artista per il Bigallo, ma fu adoperato in opere più proprie di un imbianchino che d’un artista, siccome io dimostrai, citando i documenti, nella mia storia della beneficenza fiorentina; nel quale libro riportai ancora testualmente le memorie dalle quali si desume che Ventura di Moro e Rossello di Iacopo di Scolaio Franchi furono gli autori di questi affreschi, nel 1445.[6]</p>

<p>Qui hanno termine le notizie artistiche de questo luogo, non stimando opportuno di addentrarmi nell’attiguo edifizio, dove pure si conservano non ispregevoli dipinture, nè di parlare delle opere di arte eseguite da Filippo di Cristofano, da Ambrogio di Baldese e da Mariotto di Nardo, per le quali tutte e pei documenti che vi si riferiscono può vedersi il rammentato mio libro sugli stabilimenti di beneficenza di questa città a pagine 9,150 e seguenti.</p>

Ecco la relativa partita - MCCCXLIII die X mensis martii - Item Piero Cellini et sotiis pictoribus quamcumque quantitatem percuniae quas ipse et quilibet ipsorum recipere et habere deberent et peter possent pro occasione certarum picturarum faciendarum; item pro calce et pontibus libras viginti. (Deliberazioni dei Capitani del Bigallo, 1443 e 1444, filza VI, carte 10). E e questa deve aggiungersi la seguente, vista da Rumhör e dal Becchi ma non da me - MCCCCXLIIII primo junii: Petro Chellinio pictori pro resto tolius picturae factae in domo habitationis Captineorum in facie exteriori.</p>

                <h3>Sam's Summer So Far</h3>
                <p>It has been almost exactly 3 months since I wrote my last blog post, but that doesn’t mean I haven’t been working on the project or learning about the which necessary foundational steps we need to take for the project to succeed.</p>

<p>So here’s a quick update about my work on the project:</p>

                <h3>Fieldwork in Florence</h3>
                <p>Halfway through the six-week Florentine part of the project is as good a time as any to give an update on our progress, so here goes nothing! Sam and I have been in Florence for twenty-two days now, and what we’ve realized in that time is that this project has some massive hurdles in front of it that it must overcome if we want it to become a success.</p>
