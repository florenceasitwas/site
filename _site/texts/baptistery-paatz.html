<h2 id="building-history">Building History</h2>
<p>The Baptistery is still one of the greatest enigmas in the history of architecture. From the high middle ages to today, the Baptistery has served as a favorite subject of historical fascination for serious scholars. It has been dated in the fourth and fifth centuries, in the seventh and eighth, in eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth or even fifteenth centuries, so that its building history fluctuates throughout an entire millennium. During Dante’s time, the oldest dating was abandoned. Dante argued that the building was a creation of Roman antiquity, perhaps a temple of Mars (2). In my opinion, the still older dating in the third century of the early-Christian era needs to be abandoned (3). Lastly, the hypothesis of a Lombard-era origin is only contingently correct (4); Those other hypotheses of the foundation in the eleventh or twelfth centuries are also only conditionally plausible (5); the legends of significant (modifications) in the early Renaissance are completely wrong (6). I base my account on documents and the architectural remains, but these conclusions are speculative due to regrettably inconclusive excavations of the last half-century (7).</p>

<p>The remains of three older cultural layers are located under the church. First, there are remains of a Roman palace that was probably established in the Augustan time and destroyed within Roman antiquity. Second, nested in the ruins of this palace, late-antique residential buildings and baths remain. At the end of the fourth century, this second layer was also destroyed. Graves of a Germanic cemetery dating to the early-middle ages occupy the most recent layer; one of these graves was partially destroyed with the installation of the left cornerstone of the apse of the Baptistery (8).</p>

<p>Access to the digs: in the Apse. In 897, documents first mention a church of S. Giovanni located in the northeast corner of the Roman city wall, thus on high ground (9). It was again mentioned in in 909, 967, 990, and 1040 (10). Perhaps it was initially a Baptistery and Co-cathedral of St. Reparata; at the latest in the middle of the eleventh century, S. Giovanni ceased its original use as a cathedral and served as a baptismal church and as a home of the Cathedral canons.</p>

<p>Maybe this shift was associated with the time when radical changes on the building were initiated. In 1059 or 1061 Pope Nicholas II, former bishop of Florence, likely performed a consecration in S. Giovanni, which was probably the cornerstone dedication for a monumental new building (12). The construction seems to have continued for a century. The first floor was largely finished by 1113, since Bishop Ranier, whose long governmental activity was closely linked with the first great progress of the new building (1077-1113), was buried in one of its walls (13). In 1117 the work was apparently still in progress, because the Pisans likely donated to the Florentines two columns, which then were erected in front of the Baptistery (14). In 1128 the ground floor was removed from the building (15). By 1150, and perhaps as early as 1128 (16), the design of the lantern concluded the construction of the dome and, therefore, the entire structure (17). Around this time, the cloth merchants guild began their control of the construction and the builders’ hut (18).</p>

<p>Subsequently a few larger changes were undertaken on the finished church. In 1202 they replaced the half circle form of the Apse with an oblong choir chapel, the so-called “Scarsella” (19). Around 1207 the marble floor was initiated (20). In the second half of the 13th century the great dome gained its mosaic decoration (21).</p>

<p>In the 1280s and 1290s, the Baptistery became the subject of a great architectural project for the last time, in connection with the redesign of the cathedral and cathedral square. In 1285 the city began to repave the square (22), and in 1293 or 1296, after removal of many funerary monuments, that had been embedded on the gray ashlar (Macigno), Arnolfo di Cambio encrusted external corner pillars of octagons with black-green and white marble coating. Through this massive renovation, he presumably wanted to match the Cathedral’s new façade with that of the Baptistery; he also apparently replaced the upper section of the foundation of the Baptistery (23).</p>

<p>Since then, S. Giovanni has only been restored, though very frequently and drastically. In 1339 Florence cleaned the dirty marble floor and refaced the chief ornamental molding of the cornices (24). In 1341-1346, 1364, and 1389/90 repairs on the marble roof took place (25). In 1444-1471 the tile roof needed to be completely replaced again (26). Leonardo da Vinci wanted to lift the whole building into the air in order to place a base underneath (27). In 1515 a chain was embedded into the brickwork on top of the second cornice for structural reasons (28). In 1548 broad, not accurately defined restorations took place (29). Despite the violent protests of the citizens, in 1577 Buontalenti removed the medieval baptismal font and the accompanying canon’s chancel out of the church interior in order to create a place for a baptismal scene in honor of Don Filippo, the first-born son of Grand Duke Francesco I (30); this was the most severe mutilation the building ever suffered. In 1722 the canons erected a new choir screen in order to integrate a sacristy into the apse (31). Around 1782 the architect Giuseppe Manetti cleaned the building and rebuilt the base cornice (31). From 1895-1902 the stonework of the lantern, the “Tribuna”, and the east side of the octagon were dismantled and reassembled (33). At that time, and again in 1912/15, the baroque additions in the apse and on the altars were removed. In 1887 the northwestern half of the Piazza S. Giovanni was dug up, in 1895/97 the southwestern half, and in 1912/15 the various building layers under the western half of the church were uncovered (34).</p>

<p>A full clarification of the building history can only be attained through research of the remaining, temporarily untouched site under the Baptistery and the plaza.</p>

<h2 id="reconstruction-of-lost-construction-stages">Reconstruction of Lost Construction Stages</h2>
<h4 id="the-lombard-construction-7th-and-8th-centuries">The Lombard Construction: 7th and 8th Centuries</h4>
<p>Likely a rubble-stone octagon in accordance with the current exterior old town walls (35). Several things are unknown about the Lombard Construction: whether an apse with or without a crypt was present, where the apse or apses (perhaps four) would have been located if in existence, whether a cupola or open timber framing covered the room, and where the entrances were located (36).</p>
<h4 id="original-condition-of-the-current-building">Original Condition of the Current Building</h4>
<p><em>The Corner Pillars.</em>
As on all the most important frame joints on other buildings of the Florentine incrustation style, the pillars of Macingo (i.e. gray ashlar) on the outside corners of the octagon existed until 1293/96 (37) (S. Miniato, S. Salvatore nell’ Arcivescovado, Badia Fiesolana). The ashlar cornice under the apse serves as a reminder of this phase today. Figurative reconstruction of the original conditions, the change of base, and other slight changes can be seen in retouched photography by Swoboda, “Kunstwissenschaftliche Forschungen”, II, 1933, Table 5 (and p. 64f.).</p>

<p><em>The Tombs and Monuments.</em>
Until 1296 a circle of monuments existed against the outer wall, which partially consisted of antique sarcophaguses and medieval tombs (Avella) as on S. Maria Novella (38).</p>

<p><em>The Apse.</em>
The apse was supported by the semicircular foundations under the current, square choir chapel. Today only the inner approaches in both westerly corners of the polygon are from these foundation walls. For the remaining parts, see the illustrations by Supino (Gli Albori, 1906, Tav. IV) and Galli (Riv. d’A. IX, 1916/18, page 82 and Fig. 13). The apse wall appears to have stood in loose association with the adjoining octagon wall inside and perhaps outside (39). A crypt was hardly in existence. It would have been tolerated poorly with the classical structure of the central room (40). The Apse was probably vaulted with a semi-dome and not incrusted (41).</p>

<p><em>Baptismal Font and Choral Space.</em> 1128
Removed in 1577, broken pieces rediscovered in 1905 (42).
A uniform and magnificently marble-incrusted installation in the style of the correspondingly (probably copied but simpler) structure in the Pisan Baptistery (43).</p>

<p>As the centerpiece, the baptismal font occupied the middle of the church interior, whose octagonal form is echoed in miniature. Its dimensions are indicated by the block-like foundation under the floor. It was adorned with rosette-filled coffers (presumably juxtaposed on each octagonal side as in Pisa). The rest of the ornamental panels are preserved in an Opera del Duomo warehouse, namely the larger coffer plates there. In four corners, small fountain-like chutes were attached, for the use of the baptizing Priest, like in Pisa (44). The actual baptismal font was enclosed by an octagonal gate, whose size is indicated through the undecorated surface in the middle of the Baptistery and also through the foundation walls, whose outline corresponds with it (45).
Enclosed within the gates, the choral space was a rectangular, slightly-elevated area, that, in the width of the choir chapel, filled the space between this and the octagonal gates of the baptismal font, with the latter connected through a narrow passage (46). Remains of two sided colorfully-incrusted marble gates decorated with striking antiqued coffering were rediscovered in 1905 and were stored in a warehouse of the Opera del Duomo (47). In 1339 doors were attached on the canon chancel, and in 1341 as well as in 1458 grating was installed (48). The seating inside was renovated in 1466 by Andrea di Antonio di Geri (49).
In 1577 Buontalenti planned a baroque chancel annex in the apse, to which the two spiral staircases ought to have led (50).
In 1732 Girolamo Ticcaiati established a new, marble choir space in front of the apse. It is from a semicircular form around an elevated platform. Marble balustrade reliefs of the legend of John were installed on this platform (51). The structure was removed in 1912ff. – Floorplan from Abb. page 179 (left).</p>

<p><em>The Stepped Foundation under the Church.</em>
It has never existed, as the excavations have proved. Similar to the theory of a Temple of Mars, its existence was bogus.</p>

<p><em>The Circular Light-Opening in the Top of the Dome.</em>
Like the stepped foundation, this opening has never existed (53).</p>

<p><em>Unsealed Outside Wall.</em>
Nonexistent. See the “Building History” and “Building Description” (54)</p>

<h2 id="building-description">Building Description</h2>
<p>Construction Records: The best by Milani, <em>Annali dell’Ingegneria e d’ Architettura</em>, 1918, 261-70 and by Horn, <em>Mitt. Inst. Florenz</em> V, 1938, 118, 119, 129, 150. Also see Abb. on pg. 179, 186. — A list of older building records by Ferri, <em>Indice</em>, 1885, 38; The recordings are noteworthy from G.B. Nelli (18th Century) and from Giuliano da Sangallo (circa 1500) (55). The imprecise floor plans, cupola projection, usw. by Hübsch (<em>Altchristliche Kirchen</em>, 1862, Pl. XIX, 4), by Durm (<em>Zeitschrift für Bauwesen</em>, 1887, Taf. II), by Nardini (<em>S. Giovanni</em>, 1902, Fig. 17) and by Supino (<em>Gli Albori</em>, 1906, S. 45); compare to that the critique by Horn (<em>Mitt. Inst. Florenz</em> V, 1938, 122, Note 8). Before the oldest building records, several painted depictions of the Baptistery emerged already in the 14th and 15th centuries. (56).</p>

<h4 id="the-basic-concept">The Basic Concept</h4>
<p>As the Florentine counterpart to the Pisan Cathedral and to the Church of St. Mark in Venice, the Baptistery is one of the greatest primary works of medieval architecture. It is essentially a standard creation of the late 11th and early 12th centuries.  Its basic motive—an octagon with a choir chapel—has likely been copied from the predecessor of the current construction, the Lombard Baptistery. It would appear to be a late echo of the origins of the early Christian baptismal churches (57). The style, in which this motif was implemented, represents this fantastically and surprisingly successful attempt to build around the impoverished art world of the early Middle Ages a new world, that should allow the inherited talent of the Italian race to finally advance after long centuries of abstention. The ingenious architect, who laid the foundation of the Florentine and therefore of the new Italian and European architecture in general here, began as his contemporaries in Pisa and Venice with an appropriation of the achievements of the diverse architectural schools of the early Middle Ages in the Mediterranean region, and of the Byzantine, and created on this foundation an entirely novel design of the character of the High Middle Ages. Thereby he subdued the newly-won exuberance much more decisively than the other architects of the great coastal cities and refined the pomp to symmetry in the way of the roman, western Classic, from which this late antique eastern offshoot had first arisen (58). This development was appropriately named proto-Renaissance.</p>

<h4 id="material--unity-of-construction">Material — Unity of Construction</h4>
<p>The structural central wall is composed of ashlar (Macigno), the decorative casing primarily from white Carrara marble and black-green Prato marble. The ashlar core is laid in interlocking layers, according to the changing layering techniques from the middle of the 11th century to 1150 (60). The ashlar core and marble incrustation are interwoven into each other. The central walls arose simultaneously after a unified planning (61). The ashlar can be seen today in the cornices underneath the attic. Originally the corner pillars of the octagon were also executed in ashlar (62). Repurposed columns and capitals that originated from antique buildings were incorporated into the construction (63). Details may be found in the descriptions of individual components.</p>

<h4 id="the-construction-as-a-whole">The Construction as a Whole</h4>
<p>Octagonal central building with an eight-sided, tented, not-very-steep pyramid roof, on whose top an eight-sided lantern rises upward; on the west side there is a horizontal, rectangular choir chapel. Through this chapel, the octagon obtains a line to the west; its central axis lies in the extension of the east-west central axis, formerly situated east from the Baptistery towards Sta Reparata Cathedral. The four that are parallel and right angled to the central axis were treated as main sides, and the four that are diagonally directed are less emphasized. The main sides are distinguished by these three features: they are stretched a little longer, they include the apse and the three portals, and their facades are differentiated from the others through semi-columns, richer tabernacle grouping, and through a richer incrustation motif. Also, the windows of the upper floors, whose somewhat eccentric position in the barrel niches of the gallery initially stand out as a large irregularity, are only shifted to the outside in the two side vaults of each wall in order to be able to fall in the middle of the section on the (longer) exterior of the wall, so in turn they are planned with special sensitivity for organic effect. On the inside, the middle of each of the eight sides differentiates itself from the flanking sides: it is broader and has columns from expensive materials in the biforium of the gallery (64). The main doors (in the East) emerge ahead of the two side doors through the expensive material of the columns that border the main doors. About the very important role that the destroyed baptismal font had played in the structure of the building, see “Under Reconstruction.” The structural framework and decoration, and the interior structure and exterior structure are so deeply related to each other that it is as if they reciprocally reflect one another. Here we see a composition and form completed by a genius architect that appears as High Medieval, but at the same time totally Florentine: his interest in the antique signals his status as an early Renaissance, or Proto-renaissance, builder (65).</p>

<h4 id="exterior">Exterior</h4>
<p>On the walls (with the exception of the choir side) three floors contrast with each other: the bottom floor with doors, the middle with windows, and the upper in the shape of an attic. The two bottom floors exhibit reliefs and are connected through corner pillars; The attic does not extend as far outward and exhibits a more restrained relief (66). Good illustrations may be seen in Swoboda, 1933, and Horn, <em>Mitt. Inst. Florenz</em>, V, 1938, 99.</p>

<p><em>The Corner Pillars</em>. by Arnolfo di Cambio (?), around 1293/96
On each corner of the octagon, around which these are spaced, a pillar protrudes from the walls; modeled after the Pisan style, they are colorfully structured with layers of white and black-green marble. The woodworking of the bottom floor traverses the corner pillars and merges them with the walls.</p>

<p><em>The Base Profile</em>. from Arnolfo di Cambio (?), around 1293/96 and faithfully restored in 1782.
The only things preserved from the original were the cylindrical buffers in front of the corners of the octagon (67). Initially, the cobblestones of the piazza were a little bit deeper so that the base profile came more clearly into effect.</p>

<p><em>The Bottommost Floor</em>. from around 1059-1128
Antique Framework: the corner pillars and the pilasters and wall-columns between them support an entablature that cranks itself across all wall supports with camphor; on the four slanting sides of the octagon, every second pilaster is from green marble. On the three straight, longer sides in the south, east, and north, every two wall-columns – together with a connected woodwork piece – forms a doorframe that monumentally emphasizes the three entrances. [Each of these constructions forms a frame around the doorway through which these entrances are monumentally emphasized] (68).  All the walls are covered with white marble. Decorative stripes of green marble (verde di Prato) are inlaid in the white surfaces. On the slated sides these form simple rectangles and, indeed, in each intercolumniation there are two taller ones below and three squatter rectangles above. On the three sides with doors, three are richer themes: near each door on both sides there is a giant powerful rectangle, above which appear two transverse rectangles with a central star filling the rectangle, whose dark stripes break up the white squares on their sides. On the corner pillars of the Eastern, most important, Portal stand two antique columns that were stolen in 1117 from the Arabs in Maiorca (69). All the capitals come from that era (70).</p>

<p><em>The Middle Floor</em>. from 1100 to 1128
It nearly corresponds to the bottom floor, but it is somewhat taller than the bottom floor and has more variation. Over each Pilaster and over each half column, a green marble pilaster rises from each abutment as a halved octagon-column with abutments in each case (71); over each of the two half-columns there is a semicircular, delicately-profiled, blind arch from green marble; on the corners of the octagon, these arches rest on the corner pillars described above. The middle arch on each of the three straight portal sides of the south, east, and north is broader and higher than the other arches. The larger width corresponds to the portal width beneath it. Above the arches is a high, but delicately profiled, ancient decorative frame support from gray ashlar (Macigno).
In each wall surface appears a window with delicate framing of green marble: on the four slanted sides, the shorter sides of the octagon, there is a round-arched window between the two gabled tabernacle windows; on the three straight main sides of the south, east, and north a tabernacle window sits between two rounded windows. It is the oldest example of antique tabernacle windows and, similarly, of a rhythmic organization of such windows that existed in Tuscany since the beginning of the antique era. It is the greatest example of a High Renaissance motif of this type. On the cornered tabernacles there are pilasters that act as supports for the gables, and on the colonettes there is spiraled fluting—a late antique motif (72). The white marble walls again have a green decorative stripe: under the windows appears an order of the arches of vertical strips and above there are floating rounded arches; under and near the windows there are horizontal stripes; above, in the arches, two sequences of rectangles that disappear above and laterally underneath the arches (73). Above the arches, between these and the encircling entablature, triangular gusset tabs are to be found that replicate the arched, horizontal, and vertical lines of the framing relief partition. These beautiful capitals all date from the construction period (74).</p>

<p><em>The Attic</em>. around 1128
An antique motif and in particular an antique execution. Flatter, lighter, and more delicate than the underneath, somewhat older floors. Particular to this floor, each polygon side of the attic is separated into three fields, and namely through fluted pilaster with especially antique, especially delicate, succulent capitals (75). In each area there is a green banded rectangle, and inside each there are three slim, tall banded rectangles; all bands are from green marble. The wall area and the pilasters are from white marble. On the pilasters rests an antique entablature, that bends downward in a very medieval way onto the eight attic corners and runs along perpendicularly on these corners as far as the base of the attic (76). Above the entablature, there is a wider frieze with magnificently rich, colorfully executed incrustation decoration (77).</p>

<p><em>The Roof</em>. around 1128/1150
Eight-sided, tent-like, flattish, ascending pyramid from white marble (78). At the foot of the approach there is a narrower, delicately incrusted, ornamental band made from a series of gothic pointed quatrefoils; 1339 (79).</p>

<p><em>The Lantern</em>. 1150 (80)
A Byzantine motif, implemented here in a structural building, virtually Classical-Antique in decoration, contrasts with the more lavish splendor of the late Romanesque. An octagonal small temple is formed by white marble: eight smooth columns with Composite capitals, with glazing between them; above, an entablature and a robust protruding fillet of marble, both sculpted and encrusted all over in the style of the contemporary Pisan ornamentation (81); Above, a seemingly steep, eight-sided, pyramidal roof from marble is crowned by a bronze cone and a cross.</p>

<p><em>The Choir Chapel</em>. 1202 ff.
Named “La Scarsella” (the pilgrim pouch) because of its form. Horizontal rectangular annex on the west side of the octagon. White marble with decorative elements from green and colored marble. The structure connects to the system of the middle floor of the octagon: on each side wall there is a blind arch, on the rear wall there are two blind arches. Rich incrustation ornamentation of late Pisan character. Above on the corners, there are lion heads and masks—motifs that likewise ultimately originate from the formal style of the Pisan Late-Romantic (82). —The four corner pillars and perhaps also the pediment are probably a part of the additions with which Arnolfo di Cambio enriched the Baptistery around 1293/96.</p>

<h4 id="interior">Interior</h4>
<p>This is the actual core of the whole structure. The riches of the room develop from here moving outward. From the structure of the interior, the outer structure is determined (83). The octagonal central room, topped with an eight-sided, peaked, abbey-vaulted cupola. In the west there is a crossed, rectangular choir chapel. — The sketches on page 186 serve as a base illustration of the exact description. — Swoboda took a photo in 1933. See Horn, who was at the Institut in Florence, 1938, 123.</p>

<p><em>The Structural System</em>.
Underlying that structural system is the tenant of “active resistance.” The weight of the cupola is not balanced out (like classical Roman structures) through the thickening of these curtain walls, but rather concentrates in its foundations on specific points and passes all the way into the ring of the foundation. We are dealing with a transversal framework. The walls girdles that are exhibited inside and out are not built into the transversal framework but appear to be mounted and superimposed (84). The principle of active resistance was part of the late-antique Byzantine school and contrasted with the Classical Roman system. The chief architect of the Florentine Baptistery had this idea from Byzantium (probably inspired by S. Vitale in Ravenna!), and he continued to boldly develop the principle so that he was always considered one of the greatest innovators in the area of architectural construction. See the construction schematic on page 186. It shows only the emerging framework, not the walls that span it.</p>

<p><em>The Wall Structure.</em>
“The foundational framework of the church makes up around the corners of the octagons eight broken powerful pillars. These are the only part of the construction that carry through the whole thickness of the peripheral walls and their full strength is from the base of the cupola area (85). These corner pillars are supported through these in-between walls and spacing, that in the individual floors take on various forms. There, the vertical walls of the polygon support two floors, and both floors each have two layers, an inner and an outer. The outer is comprised from an inner with marble incrusted walls, the outer wall of the octagonal building; It is very thick in the bottom floor, but thinner in the upper floor. The inner layer dissolves into an antique pillar system. Behind two pilasters appear wall pillars, upon which stands each corner of the octagon. An antique entablature and a mosaic frieze lies above and between each of the eight sides between each set of two pillars. Above it arises a light and richly organized upper floor. Each corner pillar, each with two smaller pilasters, has two equal pilasters between them on each polygonal side. Between them on each of the seven sides of the octagon there are three divided openings with semicircular arches (Biforien) which are engaged with the upper floor (freely following S. Vitale in Ravenna); in every opening of the divided, mosaiced balustrade appears a slender dividing center column. Buttresses stretch between the front pillar system and the back wall—I think that’s how they are arrayed radially around the middle point. In the bottom floor behind each intercolumniation there is a segmented arch; in the upper floor behind each biforium there is a large, barrel vaulted niche, on which black and white fresco painting fakes marble incrustation. Above the gallery, there is an antique structure with a mobile frieze.</p>

<p><em>The Cupola</em>.
An eight-parted, gothic-arched, monastery dome. The construction is developed out of these underlying zones. The following buttress system is hiding between the eight triangular, spherically curved, cupola peaks and the eight-sided pyramidal roof (86). In the middle of each of the sixteen walls of the gallery arise sixteen support posts (“sproni”), that are arranged to look like abutments against the cupola cap. Between every two support posts there is an attached, upward-rising, narrow barrel vault. Every two other support posts are allotted to the eight corners of the building—”they are so positioned that their outsides are aligned with the edges of the corresponding columns that are underneath the support posts,” which creates, so to speak, a forking of the columns (87).
Decoration: on the base of the cupola there is a frieze from a rectangular ornamented field, including medieval reproductions of antique coffering techniques. Each ornamented field has a white, entablature-like, prominent marble frame and a green-black framing laid around it, and contains a figured mosaic. Five squares are allotted on each cupola field; Around each corner there is another square. Above the square friezes there runs a final white-green-white marble striping. Over that is the great cupola mosaic in which the architectural outlines of the walls appear and disappear in the form of painted-on fake columns (88).</p>

<h6 id="the-developmental-history-of-the-structure">The Developmental History of the Structure.</h6>
<p>The octagonal floor plan was taken from the older, Lombard Baptisteries of the sixth century—particularly from S. Vitale in Ravenna— and adds a lantern to the cupola, a gallery (with its biforien) and buttresses in the form of split walls (89). Besides the Byzantine late antique, the architect of the Baptistery was inspired by the classical Roman antique of the early empire through the Pantheon in Rome. The following motifs are inspired by the Pantheon: the structural thinking behind the peripheral wall that is placed against the transversal barrel vault in loadbearing and nonloadbearing zones (90); The expressly horizontal partition of the inner wall by two powerful circumference-running entablature systems and floors; the way the triumphal arches of the choir chapel effectively break up the entablature of the ground floor; the arrangement of pilasters of the upper floor about the arches; the areas, each covered with two columns in the ground floor; and the coffers at the base of the cupola (91). From these Byzantine and Roman principles and motifs that the architect used, he developed something completely new. His invention is probably the octagonal, lancet arched, domical vaults of the cupola (92), and surely his buttressing system is the other invention, with which the functional is merged with the wonderfully beautiful. Essential characteristics of the partitioning system comply with the common European demands of High Medieval Romanesque architecture. Above all, the thing that comes across as Romanesque is the completely un-antique, un-byzantine principle of the structure of frame, inner and outer, that allows the walls to mirror one and the other. The structure of the framework “is traceable” on the partitioning of the wall space and in this way artistically capitalizes on it (93). The abstract orderliness that comes out of the rigor of the spirit of mathematics appears very un-antique and fully Romanesque. “There is not one decorative singular form that is free of this mathematical orderliness; every part of the construction is related to something underneath it or superimposed over it” (94). The last thing that really comes across as Romanesque is that the room, along with its masonry shell, is segmented into a series of sectors that radiate from a central axis of the octagon (95); the central structure doesn’t have the same effect, like the Classical and Byzantine Antique as an image of concentric, circumferential walls and room sequences, but rather as if it is split into a series of radiating yokes. In other words, the central structure is treated in the spirit of the High Romanesque Lombard nave buildings (96). One thing of course differentiates Florentine building from the High Romanesque construction of Northern Europe and also from its Carolingian-Ottonian predecessors, and it is something very serious: there is an antiqued Classicism of incomparable purity, and this Classicism calls a first Renaissance into life—the first attempt of a Florentine architect to revive the values of the national Antique, or the ancient Roman architecture, a search that determined the course of Florentine art up until the High Renaissance. Antique is the simple, peaceful unity of space: in my opinion it is thanks to the great example of the Pantheon that the Byzantine ambulatories and galleries come together here in a relief-like, relaxed wall area (97), that the single-celled octagonal central room, as a result, so majestically comes into its own. The tempietto-form of the cupola lantern is Antique, not Byzantine and not Romanesque! Also, without a doubt, another Antique feature is the fact that there are no sculpted figures to ornament the façade—a completely unRomanesque quality! And finally, its Antique appearance is certainly not the function of the individual elements of the building (an essential Romanesque quality), but a correlation of form and proportion in a consideration of the whole.</p>

<h6 id="the-intercolumniation-and-other-individual-things">The Intercolumniation and Other Individual Things.</h6>
<p>Regarding the external portion of the building see page 182 and following. In the inside, the pilasters in both floors are fluted, the columns themselves are smooth (with the exception of a single one that stands to the right of the east portal). All ancient capitals each consist of a single block of white marble and are gilded; the pilasters have Corinthian-style capitals. On the large columns in the bottom floor they are of the Corinthian and Composite style, while on the little columns of the gallery-biforium the capitals were sculpted in the Ionic style and carry flat Byzantine imposts.</p>

<p>The following parts are antique spoils (from the early classical Roman empire?): the fourteen large columns of the ground floor (twelve out of granite from Elba; one, left of the south door, out of Cipollino; and one, the fluted one to the right of this door, out of white marble) (98); the four capitals of the large columns behind the south and north doors; possibly also one or another of the four footings of those columns (99); all the columns in the gallery in the middle of the biforium of every octagonal side are vertical colonnettes (out of Cipollino and white marble; the remaining—not ancient—out of green marble and one out of ashlar) and the three ionic capitals of northwest diagonal, octagonal side immediately to the right of the choir chapel (100). All remaining parts of the columniation—by far the most—come from the High-Medieval building era. The column capitals are a part of one solid block (like the ancients), others are made out of two or more stacked blocks (as was common in Florentine architecture during that period) (101); the large ones in the bottom floor were developed and rounded and, with the exception of two, the small ones on the gallery-biforien are completely front-facing (102).</p>

<p>The pilaster capitals, without exception all from the middle ages, are from white marble and each have a frontispiece and two lateral side pieces (103). All high medieval capitals were modeled after the antique and, indeed, are so astoundingly true to that form that you can hardly differentiate them; at best it can said, in the imitation process a little bit of the organic-leafy character of the model pieces can be lost, and therefore it gains a quite hint of medieval systematizing abstraction (104). The consecutive constructive phases were probably brought about by various stone masons and their variations in the way they executed the building. On the ground floor, there are primitive examples with closed contours side by side, with very wide and flat acanthus leaves and with crude singular forms, and also finer examples – the latter are above all on the pilaster on both sides of the choir chapel (105); The later also correspond to the capitals on the first floor of the external part of the building (106). There is a third type that can be found outside on the middle floor of the southeast corner of the octagon (107). From that third type evolved a wonderful, noble type of pilaster capital on the (middle) gallery floor (108).</p>

<p>The following can be said about the classicism of the pillar system: Not that they would have been satisfied according to early Christian-Early Medieval custom or according to their own inability to help naively through the plundering of Roman buildings. No, for the first time here in Florence a genius architect dared to try to conjure up a unified antique column system from a very few remains of the golden era, from a few column shafts, capitals, and profiles. On the baptistery the following antique elements of new architecture were added: the Corinthian, Composite, and Ionic system (columns and pilasters); the straight entablature, and the entablature-like arch profile; the imposts; the tabernacle windows; the coffers; the cymatium of various styles and more, indeed in great purity, shines forth out of high medieval European design and also out of contemporary Tuscan design. More important than the inclusion of the classical design was the reinvigoration of the way it is used and the reinvigoration of classical proportions. Very decisively it determines the impression of the building, that columns and pilasters have taken on their original height and strength; that a new strict law of proportionality between the supports and intercolumniation is in place; that the well-proportioned surfaces have again assumed their original level of importance (109). In consideration of all that, the building had to have two main floors designed to adhere to new laws of proportionality; almost every other contemporary builder in the same position would have decorated the walls with a singular overly-slender column system from the ground to the cornice (Medieval Roman!) (110). The approach of the Antique was so convincing that even a century later, the construction was considered a remnant from Roman times, and thus, in the Quattrocento, it came to form the starting point of the Renaissance movement (111).</p>

<h6 id="the-incrustation">The Incrustation.</h6>
<p>The Incrustation motif on the walls of the inner rooms are similar to those on the outside, but richer. On the ground floor, the two stories of the rectangular frame reappear on the diagonal sides of the octagon again, and the two floors highlight the façade; but between them a lively connection links their edges, with a row of squares that are turned on their corners, decorated with rosettes, crosses, and other geometric motifs. On the straight, main sides are arches and gables above squares. Between the biforien and the upper gallery geometric forms, understated leafy forms, vases, and lighting unfold in this narrow surrounding strip broken up by the pilasters. In the style of this strip, but freer and lighter, the 13th century mosaic work of the inner gallery is painted (112).</p>

<p><em>The Developmental Historical Meaning of the Incrustation and Decoration</em> (113)
The Incrustation motifs originate from the same historical architectural influences as the structure of the building: a few were adopted from the ancient Roman mosaic floors that ran through the foundation of the baptistery; others grew out of the early Christian art of the 4th and 5th centuries; and still others from the Byzantine art of 6th to 11th centuries (114). The luxurious styles of the antique, late antique-early Christian, and Byzantine-early Medieval were just precursors that were translated into the rigor of the High Middle Ages, and indeed likely were connected with the late Byzantine precursors of the middle of the 11th century at S. Marco in Venice (115); the multicolored, joyful expansiveness of the precursors changed to a two-colored abstract rigor (116). The architect defined the template that led to the rich development of the Florentine style all the way up to life and times of Arnolfo di Cambio and Giotto (117).</p>

<p>In summary, the following can be said: in the effort to re-enliven the forms of the antique, there was as a last thoroughly defining conclusion: the demand for polychrome, whose amazing fulfillment in the building and primarily of the successive ones like it assured its admiration in future generations. Just as was done with the construction system, the colorful decoration grew from Byzantine roots to neoclassical, Italian, and even to a pronounced Florentine style. This colorful decoration would be foundational through the Gothic and early Renaissance period. In the Byzantine-late antique, the fundamental idea of the composition is probably to turn precious materials into a resplendent whole: we see a connection of black-green and white marble on the walls with reddish Cipollino and gilding on the columns and with mosaic decoration on the cupola, on the architrave and on the gallery balustrades (118). This works in contrast to the attempt to bring these decorations in harmony with the tectonic framework, whose function it is to underline and break up these decoration elements. There, the architect of the Baptistery again went significantly beyond the familiar, standard accomplishments of his contemporaries in Pisa and Venice, and also beyond the Antique itself. Only at the Baptistery and other Florentine buildings done in a similar style are columns, pilasters, entablatures, and arches drawn out through materials of different colors and from the base surface. Only there were the individual parts of these building elements again differentiated, and only there the surface pattern succeeds in filling the outline of the boldly stressed partitioning system.</p>

<p><em>The Flooring</em>
Complete with colorful marble Incrustation; the richest example of a medieval marble floor in Florence. The simpler, carpet-like, purely flat patterns probably did not originate from the 12th century. Rather, the more complete and perspective motifs (cubes, zigzags, etc.) originated in the 13th and 14th centuries. All of it is has been abundantly restored. In the southeast quarter of the building, a zodiac and other figural motifs in the style of the 1207 flooring of San Miniato date the floor (119).</p>

<p><em>The Choir Chapel (“La Scarsella”)</em>; 1202 ff.
 A horizontal rectangular chapel on the west side of the octagon. In the four corners, there are four columns, and above that, a groin vault – a motif that was a precursor in ancient Roman baths. The capitals and the very colorful, easily joined Incrustation decoration come across as crude: they originate from the beginning of the end of the Incrustation style (120).</p>

<h4 id="closing-appraisal">Closing Appraisal</h4>
<p>No other Florentine construction so comprehensively and so perfectly manifested all that Florentine art valued across all ages: strict spirituality that had been developed since the Middle Ages in the Christian Occident; magnificence of Mediterranean cultures which maintained the legacy of Byzantium; but above all, a near-natural, simple, and yet still wonderful, fine, and beautiful structure built in the spirt of the ancient Roman classics. That is why this “Temple” of the holy patron saint of Florence, the “bel San Giovanni” (so named by Dante due to his loving nature), for all times has been considered the symbol of the city of Florence, its spirit, and its self-assurance (121).</p>

<h2 id="baugeschichte-s-giovanni">Baugeschichte S. Giovanni</h2>

<p>Das Baptisterium ist noch immer eines der großen Rätsel der Architekturgeschichte. Schon seit dem hohen Mittelalter ein Lieblingsgegenstand der historischen Phantasie,wird es bis auf den heutigen Tag von ernsten Gelehrten bald ins vierte und fünfte Jahrhundert, bald ins siebente und achte, bald ins elfte, zwölfte, dreizehnte, oder gar fünfzehnte Jahrhundert datiert, so daß seine Ansetzung noch immer um ein volles Jahrtausend schwankt. Allgemein aufgegeben ist nur die älteste, schon im Zeitalter Dantes nachweisbare These, der Bau sei eine Schöpfung der römsichen Antike, etwa ein Marstempel (2). Aufzugeben ist meiner Meinung nach auch die noch ältere, bereits im frühen 13. Jahrhunder nachweisbare Datierung in die frühschristliche Epoche (3). Nur bedingt richtig ist schließlich die Hypothese eines Ursprungs in langobardischer Zeit (4); ebenso bedingt annehmbar nur auch jene andere Hypthese der Gründung im elften oder zwölften Jahrhundert (5); ganz falsch die Legende von wesentlichen Zufügungen der Frührenaissance (6). Ich gründe meine Darstellung auf die Dokumente und den Baubefund, vor allem aber auf die Ergebnisse der Leider sehr unvollständigen Ausgrabungen des letzten Halbjahrunderts (7).</p>

<p>Unter der Kirche befinden sich Reste von drei älteren Kulturschichten. Erstens Reste eines römischen Palastes, der wohl in augusteischer Zeit errichtet und noch in römischer Zeit zerstört wurde. Zweitens, in den Ruinen dieses Palastes eingenistet, Reste von spätantiken Wohnhäusern und Thermen, die ebenfalls zerstört wurden (aber erst nach dem Ende des 4. Jahrhunderts). Drittens Gräber wurde vondem Fundament des linken Eckpfeilers der Baptisteriumsapsishalb zerstört (8). – Zugang zu den Ausgrabungen: in der Apsis. Eine Johanneskirche im nordöstlichen Winkel des römischen Mauerringes, also an der heutigen Stelle, wird urkundlich erwähnt zuerst 897 (9), und dann 909, 967, 990, und 1040 (10). Möglicherweise war sie ursprünglich Baptisterium und Konkathedrale der hlg. Reparata: spätestens um die Mitte des 11. Jahrhunderts trat sie die Kathedralen würde aber ganz an die vor ihr liegende Basilika S. Reparata abund diente seither ausschließlich als Taufkirche und Stift der Domkanoniker (11).</p>

<p>Vielleicht stand dieser Wechsel in Zusammenhangdamit, daß damals einschneidende Veränderungen an dem Bau bewirkt wurden. 1059 oder 1061 nahm Papst Nikolaus II., Exbischof von Florenz, anscheinend eine Weihe in S. Giovanni vor, und zwar wahrscheinlich die Grunsteinweihe für einen monumentalen Neubau (12). Die Bautätigkeit scheint dann ein volles Jahrhundert angedauert zu haben. 1113 muß das Erdgeschoß bereits großenteils fertig gewesen sein, da man an einem seiner Wände den Bischof Rainer beisetzte, dessen lange Regierungstätigkeit (1077-1113) eng mit den ersten großen Fortschritten des Neubaus verbunden gewesen sein mag (13). 1117 waren die Arbeiten offenbar noch im Gang, denn zu ihrer Förderung doch wohl schenkten die Pisaner den Florentinern zwei Säulen, die dann vor dem Gebäude aufgestellt wurden (14). 1128 wurde das Erdgeschloß anscheinend in Benutzung genommen (15). 1150 beschloß die Aufsetzung der Laterne den Kuppelbau, der 1128 vielleicht auch schon im wesentlichen fertig gewesen war (16), und damit das ganze Bauunternehmen (17). Schon um diese Zeit scheint die Calimalazunft, die Zunft der Kaufleute, den Bau und die Bauhütte, die weiter bestehen blieb, detreut zu haben (18).</p>

<p>Nachtträglich wurden an der fertigen Kirche noch einige nicht unwesentliche Veränderungen vorgenommen. 1202 ersetzte man die halbkreisförmige Apsis durch eine rechtickige Chorkapelle, die sogenannte “Scarsella” (19). Um 1207 war der Marmorfußboden in Arbeit (20). In der zweiten Hälfte des 13. Jahrhunderts erhielt die große Kuppel ihren Mosaikschmuck (21). – In den achtziger und neunziger Jahren endlich wurde das Baptisterium ein letztes Mal zum Gegenstand größerer architecktonischer Projekte, und zwar im Zusammenhang mit der Neugestaltung des Domes und des Domplatzes. 1285 begann man mit der Herstellung eines neuen Pflasters auf dem Platz (22), 1293 oder 1296 inkrustierte Arnolfo di Cambio nach Beseitigung vieler Grabdenkmäler die bis dahin aus grauem Haustein (Macigno) bestehenden äußeren Eckpfeiler des Oktogons mit schwarzgrünen und weißen Marmorschichten; wahrscheinlich wollte er dadurch die Taufkirche seiner neuen, stark mit diesem Mittel wirkenden Domfassade anpassen; er erneuerte anscheinend auch das obere Profil der Basis des Baptisteriums (23).</p>

<p>Seither ist S. Giovanni nur mehr restauriert worden, allerdings sehr häufig und ziemlich durchgreifend. 1339 reinigte man den verschmutzten Marmarbelag und erneuerte die oberste Ornamentleiste des Kranzgesimses (24). 1341-46, 1364, 1389/90 fanden Reparaturen am Marmordach statt (25). 1444-1471 mußte der Plattenbelag des Daches noch einmal unvollständig erneuert werden (26). Lionardo da Vinci soll das ganze Gebäude mechanisch in die Luft haben heben wollen, um einen Sockel darunter setzen zu können (27). 1515 wurde aus statischen Gründen in Höhe des zweiten Gesimses eine Kette in das Mauerwerk eingelassen (28). 1548 fanden weitere, nicht genauer definierte Restaurierungen statt (29). 1577 entfernte Buontalenti trotz heftigster Proteste der Bürgerschaft das mittelalterliche Taufecken und den dauzugehörigen Kanonikerchor aus dem Kirchenraum, um Platz für eine Taufdekoration zu Ehren des Don Filippo, des Erstgeborenen des großherzogs Francesco I., zu schaffen (30); es war die schwerste Verstümmelung, die das Gebäude je erlitten hat. 1722 ließen die Kanoniker einen Sakristeiraum in die Apsis einbauen und davor neue Chorschranken errichten (31). Um 1782 reinigte der ARchitekt Giuseppe Manetti das Gebäude und erneuerte das Sockelgesims (32). 1895-1902 wurde das Steinwerk der Laterne, der Tribuna und der Ostseite des Oktogons auseinandergenommen und neu zusammengefügt (33). Damals und 1912/15 entfernte man die barocken Zutaten in der Apsis und an den Altären. 1887 wurde die nordwestliche Hälfte der Piazza S. Giovanni ausgegraben, 1895/97 die südwestliche Hälfte, und 1912/15 wurden die verschiedenen Bauschichten unter der Westhälfte der Kirche freigelegt (34).–Eine völlige Klärung der Baugeschichte kann nur durch Erforschung der übrigen, einstweilen unberührten Geländeteile unter dem Baptisterium und dem Platz erreicht werden.</p>

<h2 id="anmerkungen">Anmerkungen</h2>

<p>(1) Dokument von 899: Geschichte von Florenz I, 1896, 73.</p>

<p>(2) Die Vorstellung, S. Giovanni sei ursprüglich ein Tempel des angeblichen heidnischen Stadtpatrons von Florenz, des Mars, gewesen und sei dann dem jüngeren, christlichen Stadtpatron, dem Täufer Johannes, zu Ehren umgeweiht worden, liegt schon einigen Versen Dantes zugrunde (Inferno XIII, 143, 156; XIX, 16; vgl. darüber Lumachi, <em>Mem. stor.</em> 1782, 4; Gruyer, <em>Les oeuvres d’art de la Renaissance au Temple de St. Jean</em>, 1875, 271). Der Meinung Dantes folgte sein Kommentator Boccaccio (Richa V, 1757, XXVII). Giovanni Villani (lib. I, cap. XLII und LX) gab dieser Legende eine bestimmtere Form, indem er behauptete, das Bauwerk sei zur Zeit des Augustus von stadtrömischen Bauleuten zu Ehren des Mars errichtet und zur Zeit Papst Silvesters und Kaiser Konstantins in eine Kirche des Täufers verwandelt worden; deutlich läßt dabei seine Erwähnung der Ähnlichkeit zwischen S. Giovanni und dem Pantheon den Anlaß zur Bildung dieser Legende erkennen. Unter den Anhängern dieser These im 14. Jahrhundert werden noch Petrarca und Franco Sacchetti gennant, unter denen des 15. Jahrhunderts Matteo Palmieri und Polizian (Richa V, 1757, VI, und andere), und wir können zu den letzteren noch den um 1475 schreibenden Piero Cennini fügen (<em>Riv. d’A</em> VI, 1909, 220). Im Cinquecento spricht Albertini von dieser These, und zwar mit einigen Ausschmückungen (Memoriale, 1510, 9); ebenso spielt Vasari darauf an (I, 333, VIII, 425), und auch Poccianti (<em>Vite de’sette Beati Fiorentini</em>, 1589, 140). Besonders aber verlieh der hochgelehrte Vincenzo Borghini der Marstempeltheorie eine höhere Wirksamkeit, indem er auf Crund des antikiserenden Charackters der Bauformen die Gegenmeinung zu entkräften versuchte, S. Giovanni könne im langobardischer Zeit als Taufkirche gegründet sein, und indem er eine zeichnerische Rekonstruktion des von ihm vermuteten ursprünglichen Zustands seines “Marstempels” gab (<em>Discorsi</em>, I, 1584, 145ff., 149f., 153, 154, 156f., 162; siehe auch den Brief vom 23. XI. 1564 bei Gaye, III, 1840, 158). Cinelli suchte auf Grund einer handschriftlichen Chronik in der Laurenziana die Entstehung des Baus auf das Jahr 35 nach Chrsiti Geburt festzulegen (Bocchi-Cinelli, 1677, 25). Zuletzt nahm noch Richa an, wenigstens die äußere Mauerschale könne von einem Marstempel übrig geblieben sein (V, 1757, XII, XIII). – Die Marstempelthese wurde dann im 17. und 18. Jahrhundert durch die Beobachtung erschüttert, daß die achteckige Form von S. Giovanni nicht aus dem heidnischen, wohl aber aus dem christlichen Kult erklärt werden könne, und daß in dem Bau vielfach Spoilien aus zerstörten römischen Bauten verwendet worden sind, daß er also aus mittelalterlicher Zeit stammen müsse (Del Migliore, 1684, 82, 84; Lami Lezioni, I, 135; und andere). Im 19. Jahrhundert wurde diese Beweisführung, fortgesetzt und vertieft (vgl. vor allem Hübsch, Die altchristlichen Kirchen etc., 1862, Spalte 41 ff. und Nardini, S. Giovanni, 1902, 7, 8). – Endgültig widerlegt wurde die Marstempel-These erst durch die Ausgrabungen des 19. und 20. Jahrhunderts, die unter den Grundmauern des Baptisteriums zu oberst einen Friedhof aus der Völkerwanderungszeit, dann Gebäudereste aus spätrömischer Epoche und zu unterst Reste eines Palastes aus frühkaiserlicher Zeit zutage förderten (1. Jahrh. nach Christi Geburt?). Vgl. unten Anm. 8 und Swoboda, Kunstwissenschaftliche Forschungen II, 1933, 64. – Ich gebe als Anhang noch einen Überblick, wie die genannten Autoren sich den hypothetischen Marstempel vorstellen. Vorbild der rekonstruierenden Phantasie war zugegebenermaßen das Pantheon. So vermutete Giovanni Villani, das Gebäude habe in heidnischer Zeit keine Apsis gehabt und keine Laterne, sondern eine unbedeckte Kreisöffnung im Scheitel der Kuppel (lib. I, cap. LX). Schon früh gesellte sich zu diesen antikischen Zügen noch der aus Vitruv als typisch bekannte Stufensockel, das Podium (Piero Cennini, 1475; vgl. Riv. d’A. VI, 1909, 221), und der ebenfalls durch die inzwischen vertieften archäologischen Kenntnisse erforderte Porticus im Westen (Vincenzo Borghini, Discorsi I, 1584, 163, 164). In diesem Stadium wurde die Theorie durch die Holzschnitte Borghinis veranschaulicht. Abhängig von Borghini vor allem Bocchi-Cinelli (1677, 26) und Del Migliore (1684, 88f., 97), der aber doch schon einige Kritik übt. Eine neue und letzte, mehr an den römischen Amphitheatern orientierte Holzschnitt-Rekonstruktion gab Richa (V, 1757, XII, XIII). Foll.-Rastr. erwähnen noch eine gemalte Rekonstruktion (III, 1791, 11). Vgl. auch Lumachi, Mem. stor. 1782. 13f.</p>

<p>(3) Die These der Entstehung des Baptisteriums in frühchristlicher Zeit ist noch etwas älter als die Marstempel-These. Schon im frühen 13. Jahrh. besagte die Chronica de origine civitatis, S. Giovanni sei nach der Zerstörung der Stadt durch Totila von römischen Meistern erbaut worden, und zwar in Nachahmung von S. Giovanni in Laterano (siehe Swoboda, Baptisterium, 1918, 64). Hundert Jahre später “verbesserte” Ricordano Malespini Giovanni Villanis These dahin, daß der Bau zur Zeit des Todes Christi zu Ehren des Johannes erbaut worden sei (Istoria fiorentina, ed. Livorno, 1830, I, cap. 38, 82). Im 16. Jahrhundert vertrat Girolamo Mei dieselbe Meinung gegenüber Vincenzo Borghini (vgl. darüber Manni, Principii della religione cristiana, 1764, 73/74). Damals vertiefte Del Migliore noch diese These durch Erneuerung des uralten Hinweises auf die Ähnlichkeit des Baus mit anderen Baptisterien wie S. Giovanni in Laterano, Pisa, Pistoria, Parma etc. (vgl. auch Richa V, 1757, VI). Für das 18. Jahrhundert vgl. Gori (Lumachi, Mem. stor. 1782, 6 ff.) und Manni, der die Theorie von der Gründung zu Baptisteriumszwecken noch durch einen Hinweis auf die für diesen Zweck typische Lage vor der Fassade der Kathedrale betonte (Principii della Religione cristiana, 1764 S. 73/74; Gegengründe bei del Rosso, Ricerche, 1820, 28f.). Im 19. Jahhundert glaubte G. Cordero den Bau wegen seiner Verwandtschaft mit den antikisierend-byzantinischen Schöpfungen Theoderichs und Justinians ins 6. Jahrhundert setzen zu sollen (Dell’Italiana Architettura durante la dominazione longobarda, Bescia, 1829, 203f.). Ebenso dachten Rumohr und Fergusson an die Möglichkeit eines frühchristlichen Ursprungs (Ital. Forsch. III, 1831, 178, 180; A history of architecture, 1874, I, 437). Mit höchster Energie verfochten wurde diese Meinung aber von Hübsch und Nardini. Hübsch setzte den Kernbau ins 4. oder 5. Jahrhundert, die Bioforien der inneren Empore aber ins 13. Jahrhundert (Detucsches Kunstblatt, 1855, 184ff.; Die altchristlichen Kirchen etc. 1862, Spalte 41 ff.; Gegengründe bei Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, 61). Nardini baute seine temperamentvoll vorgetragene Hypothese auf historischen Erwägungen auf (Erwähnung des Baptisteriums schon im 8. Jahrhundert. Unwahrscheinlichkeit der Gründung in der ärmlichen langobardischen Epoche) und suchte sie durch stilistische Vergleiche mit anderen, ähnlichen, frühchristlichen Bauten zu sichern (Ähnlichkeit mit S. Lorenzo in Mailand und S. Vitale in Ravenna, Absetzung gegen die sicheren Bauten des 11. und 12. Jahrhunderts wie S. Miniato etc); vgl. A. e st. VII, 1888, 129ff., 132 ff. und S. Giovanni,1902, 4ff., 16ff., 39ff., 46/47ff., 76, 78, 79-81, 87, 100 etc. Wie Nardini urteilte auch Reymond (La sculpture florentine II, 1898, 79/80). Gegen ihn argumentierten überzeugend Davidsohn, der die Haltlosigkeit der historischen Grundlagen Nardinis nachwies (Forschungen z. G. Florenz IV, 1908, 461) und Supino (Gli Albori, 1906, 26-34, 47). In denselben Jahren ergaben die Ausgrabungen das römische Wohnungen standen und daß sich in der folgenden Völkerwanderungszeit dort ein Friedhof entwickelte, dessen Datierung zwischen dem 6. und 8. Jahrhundert strittig ist (vgl. unten Anm. 8). Damit ist der frühchristlichen These endgültig der Boden entzogen. Doch hat sie noch immer Anhänger, wie Venturi (Storia I, 1901, 103), Toesca (Storia III, 1927, 105ff. und 648ff.), Rupp, Inkrustationsstil, 1912, 24, 58 ff., und Anthony, Art Stud. V, 1927, 107.</p>

<p>(4) Für einen langobardischen Ursprung des Baptisteriums erklärte sich zuerst G. B. Nelli, indem er auf den Johanneskult der Langobarden hinwies (Piante ed alzati di S. Maria del Fiore IV, 34, 37; Exzerpte bei Richa V, 1755, VIIf. und Rupp, Inkrustationsstil, 1912, 23, 24). Lami präzisierte diese Theorie dahin, daß die Königin Theolinde den Täufer zum Schutzpatron des Reichs erwählt habe und daß die Florentiner diesem Regierungsakt zuliebe ihren Johannesdom gegründet hätten (Mon. II, 1758, 937ff.; Lezioni d’antichità cristiane, 1766, I, 59/60; abgedruckt bei Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, 53f.). Lamis Theorie gründet sich wohl auf eine Stelle über den Johanneskult der Langobarden bei Paulus Diakonus (Bald. I, 76 ff.). Der Meinung Lamis folgten: Paciaudi, De cultu S. Jo. Baptistae, 1755, 14; Lastri, Oss. 1777, II, 51: Lumachi, Mem. stor. 1782, 7ff.; Foll.-Rastr. III, 1791, 11; d’Agincourt, Historie de l’art par les monumens I, ARchitecture 1811-23, 119; M. I. Isabelle, Les édifices circulaires et les d’mes, 1855, 105; Prezzolini, Storia politico-religiosa del popolo fiorentino I, 1865, 93; I. Fergusson, A history of architecture I, 1874, 437; Hartwig, Quellen zur Geschichte von Florenz I, 1875, 82; G. B. Befani, Mem. stor. 1884, 15; R. Cattaneo, L’architettura in Italia dal secolo VI al mille, 1888, 46f.; A e st. XVI, 1897, 100.- Energisch bestätigt wurde diese Meinung – unter Heranziehung von Urkunden aus langobardischer Zeit, die das Florentiner Baptisterium erwähnen! – von Davidsohn und Frey, und zwar noch einmal bestätigt in dem (irrigen) Sinne, daß das heutige Gebäude mit Ausnahme der Inkrustation langobardisch sei (Geschichte von Florenz I, 1896, 41, 72; Forschungen z. G. Florenz I, 1896 146; Loggia de’Lanzi, 1885, 62; Vasari I, 1911, 576f.) So auch Behne, Inkrustationsstil in Toscana, 1912, 90/91 und Milani, Annali d’Ingegneria e Architettura, 1918. – Die Gegengründe gegen die langobardische These hat G. Cordero zusammengestellt (Dell’italiana architettura durante la dominazione longobarda, Bescia, 1829, 203f.) Vgl. auch Schnaase, Geschichte der bildenden Künste im Mittelalter I, 1871, 442 und vor allem Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, 46 sowie Swoboda, Baptisterium, 1918, 60. Der Stil der Konstruktion und der Dekoration des jetzigen Baus verbietet eine Ansetzung vor dem 11. Jahrhundert (vgl. unten). Doch bliebt als brauchbarer Gewinn dieser These, daß das Vorhandensein eines älteren langobardischen Baus an dieser Stelle dokumentarisch bewiesen worden ist (vgl. auch unten).</p>

<p>(5) Kugler meinte, die 1117 erfolgte Schenkung von zwei Säulen an die Florentiner durch die Pisaner müsse als ein Beitrag Zum Bau des Baptisteriums aufgefaßt werden; der Baubeginn könne also um 1117 angesetzt werden, der Abschluß des Baus um 1150 (Villani: Aufsetzungetnug der Laterne); vgl. Geschichte der Baukunst II, 1858, 58f. (Polemik daran anschließen: Hübsch, im Deutschen Kunstblatt, 1855, l84ff.; Kugler ebenda, S. 228; wie Hübsch auch Forschungen z. G. Florenz I, 1896, 24). Der Meinung von Kugler schlossen sich folgende Autoren an: Burckhardt (Cicerone I, 1860, 110: mit Herabrückung ins Ende des 12. Jahrhunderts); Lübke in den Mitteilungen der k. k. Zentral-Kommission V, 1860, 169 (mit Zurückdatierung ins 11. Jahrhundert); Schnaase (Mitteilungen der k. k. Zentralkommission, 1860, V, 169; Geschichte der Baukunst IV, 1871, 442: mit Zurückdatierung ins 11. Jahrhundert), Dehio-v. Bezold (Kirchliche Baukunst des Abendlandes, I, 1892, 544). – Diese Meinung litt an dem Fehler, daß die Dokumente aus der Zeit vor dem II. Jahrhundert nicht berücksichtigt wurden (außer von Schanaase), die das Vorhandensein eines älteren Baus bewiesen. Andererseits brachten sie überzeugende und dokumentarisch bestätige Beweisgründe für die Datierung des heutigen Baus bei. Beide Argumentgruppen berücksichtigte dann zuerst Supino, dessen Beweisführung ich weiter zu entwickeln versuche.</p>

<p>(6) Rupp, Inkrustationsstil, 1912 (S. 80 und an vielen anderen Stellen). Diese These könnte für sich in Anspruch nehmen, daß ein Wappen des frühen 15. Jahrhunderts im Hof des Bargello das Baptisterium ohne die Attika zeigt. Doch beweisen die Fresken des 14. Jahrhunderts im Bigallo und im Hof von S. Croce, sowie die Truhe aus dem frühen 15. Jahrhundert im Bargello eindeutig, daß die Attika damals schon vorhanden war. Die Dokumente des Trecento beweisen ferner, daß Attika und Dach damals bereits erneuerungsbedürftig, also schon sehr alt waren. – Rupps Beweisführung verdient keine ernstliche Widerlegung. Ihr folgte – unbegreiflicherweise! – Frankl (Handbuch für Kunstwissenschaft, Die frühmittelalterliche und romanische Baukunst, 1926, 225).</p>

<p>(7) Mein Ausgangspunkt ist die auf synthetische Untersuchungen gestützte, alle früheren Argumente zusammenfassende These Supinos, daß das Baptisterium in langobardischer Zeit gegründet, im 11. und 12. Jahrhundert aber von Grund auf erneuert worden sei. Für den Ursprung des Gebäudes wies Supino auf die Dokumente hin, für die Erneuerung auf den stilistischen Charakter des Baus, dessen Verwandtschaft mit datierten Bauten des 11. Jahrhunderts (Empoli usw.) und dessen entwickelte Formen eine solche Ansetzung erforden (Gli Albori, 1906, 18 ff., 26ff., 53f., 56f., 58.; nicht stichhaltige Gegengründe bei Frey-Vasari I, 1911, 580 und Anthony, ARt Stud. V, 1927, 108). Vgl. auch Testi e Rodolico, Le arti figurative nella storia d’Italia, 1907, 322. Swoboda suchte mit völlig verfehlten stilkritischen Darlegungen die von Supino gegebenen Daten dahin zu variieren, daß der beschluß zum Neubau 1050 gefaßt worden sei (Baptisterium, 1918, 74ff.); gegen ihn sprechen die Dokumente und er Stil, vgl. unten. Wie Swoboda urteilte auch Frankl, Die frühmittelalterliche Baukunst, 1926, 224. Beenken rückte den Bau in die zweite Hälfte des 10. und in die erste Hälfte des 11. Jahrhunderts (Z.f.b. K. LX, 1926/27, 250ff.). Salmi setzte ihn meines Erachtens viel richtiger in die zweite Hälfte des 11. Jahrhunderts (Arch. rom. 9). Meine Darstellung sicht die Datierung Supinos und Salmis durch Berücksichtigung neuer Anhaltspunke zu erhärten.</p>

<p>(8) Wegen der Bedeutung dieser Reste sollen die im Haupttext gemachten kurzen Andeutung hier noch genauer erläutert werden. Über dem Gelände des Baptisteriums und des heute verschwundenen Ostflügels des bischöflichen Palastes ist in frühkaiserlicher Zeit ein großer, mosaikgeschmückter Palast erbaut worden der von den Archäologen hypothetisch als Prätorium angesprochen wird, d. h. als Amtssitz des Kommandanten der römischen Militärkolonie Florenz. Dieser Palast muß dann zerstört worden sein und seine Trümmer den Einflüssen der Witterung lange dargeboten haben. In spät­-antiker Zeit wurden seine Überreste zur Errichtung ärmlicher Wohnungen und Thermen verwendet, die nach Maßgabe von Münzfunden noch im 5. Jahr­hundert nach Christi Geburt in Benutzung waren: Münze des Kaisers Hono­rius (Regierungszeit 395–423). Später müssen auch sie zerstört worden sein (wohl von den Goten). In dem allmählich über ihren Resten sich ansam­melnden Erdreich wurde schließlich von Germanen (Goten oder Lango­barden: charakteristische Grabfunde!) ein Friedhof angelegt, der das ganze oben abgegrenzte Areal überdeckte. Die Zeit, in der das geschah, ist strittig. Nach Gallis Meinung, die sich auf den Typus der Gräber und auf den Stil ihrer Beigaben stützt, käme das 6./7. Jahrhundert in Frage; nach Toesca dagegen bereits das späte 5. Jahrhundert (vgl. die Polemik Galli-Tarchiani-­Toeaca in Marzocco, 1917). Hätte Toesca recht, so könnte das Baptisterium, das auf diesem Friedhof errichtet wurde und ihn z. T. zerstörte, bereits im 6. Jahrhundert gegründet worden sein (vgl. auch Toesca, Storia, 1927, lO5ff.). Doch scheint mir Toescas Frühdatierung der Gräber mißlungen (so auch Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 101). Wie Horn richtig fordert, müßte die Datierung der Gräber noch einmal von frühgeschichtlicher Seite her sachkundig untersucht und genauer geklärt werden.

Florenz I, 1896, 24 und Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, 49. – Ein Dokument von 898 veröffentlicht bei Lami, Mon.I, 1758, 593. – Eine ältere, die Kirche bereits nennende Urkunde des Bischofs Speziosus vom Jahre 724 wird für eine Fälschung gehalten (Lami, Mon. I, 1758, 940; Hartwig, Quellen und Forschungen I, 1875, 83; Forschungen z. G. Florenz IV, 1908, 461; Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, 29 usw.). – Über den Erhaltungszustand des Baptisteriums im 10. Jahrhundert vgl. Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 110, Anm. 2. Die Entstehungszeit dieses ältesten Baptisteriums kann nach oben, gegen die Spätantike hin, abgegrenzt werden durch das Datum des germanische Friedhofs; diese Datum lieglt schwerlich vor dem 6. Jahrhundert und vielleicht erst im 7. Jahrhundert (vgl. vorige Anm.). Dies bliebt bestehen, auch wenn es nicht die Mauern des Gründungsbaus waren, die eines der Germanengräber zerstörten (so urteilte Galli), sondern die Fundamente des Erneuerungsbaus aus dem 11. Jahr­hundert (wie es meines Erachtens der Augenschein lehrt): denn die Gräber nehmen offenbar noch keine Rücksicht auf einen Kirchenbau, unter dem und um den herum sie an sich möglicherweise angelegt sein könnten. Die Aus­grabungen bestätigen also die Theorie des langobardischen Ursprungs der Kirche und schließen eine Entstehung vor dem späten 5. Jahrhundert aus. So jetzt auch Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 100. – Ob die jetzigen Fundamente des Baptisteriums langobardisch sind oder ob sie aus dem 11./12. Jahrhundert stammen, bzw. ob in dem jetzigen, offensichtlich großenteils aus dem 11./12. Jahrhundert herrührenden Fundament-Oktogon ein älteres, langobardisches stekt (was sehr wahrscheinlich sein dürfte), ist bei der vgl. darüber unter Rekonstruktion Anm. 35. – Die langobardische Johanneskirche lag in einem Winkel des Mauerrings, ähnlich wie der Pisaner Dombezirk, nicht aber außerhalb der Mauern, wie manchmal behauptet worden ist (vgl. darüber Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, 55f. und den Plan bei Rupp, Inkrustationsstil, 1912, 44).</p>

<p>(11) Für die Kathedraltheorie sprechen die Dokumente, die bis zur Mitte des 11. Jahrhunderts das Florentiner Bistum nach Johannes dem Täufer benennen, dann eine Zeitlang nach Johannes und nach der hlg. Reparata, und erst seit dem 12. Jahrhundert ausschließlich nach der letzteren. Gegen diese Theorie spricht die achteckige Form, die S. Giovanni von Anfang an zur Taufkirche bestimmt erscheinen läßt, und die Tatsache, daß die Basilika der hlg. Reparata genau in der Lage und Gestalt gegründet wurde, die ein Dom im Verhältnis zu seiner Taufkirche in dieser Zeit gewöhnlich hatte. Vgl. über diese Frage unter S. Maria del Fiore und S. Reparata; siehe auch vor allem folgende Literatur: Del Migliore, 1684, 87; Lami, Mon. II, 1758, 937f.; Lumachi, Mem. stor. 1782, 15ff. Cianforgni, S.

<p>(12) Über dieses Datum vgl. neuerdings Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 112. Seine Darlegung sei hier wiedergegeben, da sie alle einschlägigen Pro­bleme vorbildlich klarlegt. “Das Dokument der Weihe ist verloren oder hat niemals existiert. Davidsohn (Geschichte von Florenz 1, 1896, 218, Anm. 3) hat in der Sakristei des Baptisteriums ein von ,, ,,einer Hand des 17. oder 18. Jahrhunderts geschriebenes” “ Verzeichnis der Feste von S. Giovanni gesehen, in dem unter dem 6. November 1059 die Dedikation der Kirche durch Nikolaus II. angeführt war (Verbleib unbekannt). Die Weihe ist schon erwähnt bei Del Migliore, 1684, 111, nur wird dort als Datum statt des 6. November 1059 der 6. November 1061 angegeben. Nach Del Migliore, der sich auf Ughelli beruft (Italia sacra III, wo ich eine entsprechende Erwähnung nicht finden kann), stammt diese Nachricht von dem Senatore Carlo Strozzi, ,, ,,che fra le scritture del monastero di S. Felicità ve ne trovasse una, che mostrava essersi stata fatta tale funzione, per mano d’un papa che fu Niccolò II (quelli che era stato vescovo di Firenze sotto il nome di Gherardo di Borgogne) nel anno secondo del suo pontificato, che cade nel 1061””. Der 6. November ist – Hinweis Davidsohns – als Weihtag von S. Giovanni schon in den am Ende des 12. Jahrhundersts. geschriebenen Rubricae ecclesiasticae, Cod. Riccard. 3005 (3138), f. 96a angeführt, dort aber ohne Jahrsangabe, und weiterhin – aber auch hier ohne Jahresangabe – in den wahrscheinlich zwischen 1228 und 1332 geschreibenen Mores et Consuetudines canonicae florentinae (vgl. dazu acuh Nardini, S. Giovanni, 1902, und Supino, Gli albori, 1906, 61f.). – Die Überlieferung behält, da der Zusammenhang von Tages- und Jahresdatum nicht gesichert ist, doch immerhin etwas Zweifelhaftes, trotz des Alteres der Tagesfeier und trotz dem Hinweis Del Migliores auf eine angeblich von dem Senatore Strozzi unter den Schriften von S. Felicità gefundes Dokument mit jenem Datum.” - Frey kannte den hier dargelegten Sachverhalt, hielt ihn aber merkwürdigerweise für völlig unverbindlich, da ihm die Vornahme einer so wichtigen Weihe an einem Sonnabend (statt Sonntag) unwahrscheinlich vorkam (Vasari I, 1911, 577). Auch Davidsohn und Swoboda (Baptisterium, 1918, 63) zweifelten an der Zuverlässigkeit des Datums. Ihnen und Frey widersprach mit überzeugenden Gründen Salmi (Arch. rom. S. 37). Er meinte jedoch (S. 35), der Neubau könne bei der Weihe von 1059 noch nicht gut vollendet gewesen sein. Ich gehe in dieser Richtung noch weiter, indem ich die Weihe als eine Anfangsweihe, nicht aber als eine Schlußweihe deute, und werde dazu durch die Tatsache angeregt, daß noch bis 1150 fortdauernd Bauarbeiten in Gang waren (vgl. unten). Diese Tatsache ist auch ein Haupt­grund gegen die stilistisch ebenfalls unhaltbare Datierung Beenkens (10. Jahrh. 1. Hälfte 11. Jahrh.: Z. f. b. K. LX, 1926/27, 250f. - Damit wende ich mich auch gegen Swobodas Berichtigung seiner älteren These, die darauf hinausläuft, das Datum 1059 sei zuverlässig, bezeichne aber die Voll­endung des langobardischen Baus, nicht die Begründung der jetzigen Kirche (Kunstwissensch. Forschungen II, 1933, 74). - Horn (a. a. O., 1938, 112/113) legte die Überlieferung des Datums in der oben wiedergebenen Weise klar und kam zu dem Schluß, das Datum sei immerhin zweideutig und zweifelhaft, und es bliebe noch zu klären, ob es philologisch zu REcht als Termin einer Gründungsweihe gedeutet werden könne. Dennoch stimmte Horn meiner Annahme zu, das heutige Baptisterium müsse um 1059/61 begonnen sein (a. a. O., 1938, 113/114). Seine Gründe sind folgende: Erstens die Verwandtschaft des jetzigen Baus mit S. Miniato, bzw. mit den Teilen dieser Kirche, die im zweiten Drittel des 11. Jahrhunderts entstanden. Zweitens die Tatsache, daß die Baptisteriumskapitelle etwas jünger wirken als die Kapitelle der romanischen Kirche S. Felicità, die ebenfalls von Papst Nikolaus II. eingeweht wurde, und zwar einen Tag nach der angeblichen Grundsteinweihe von S. Giovanni – am 7. November 1059. Dritten muß der Bau, wie die zusammenhängende, zäsurenlose Entwicklungsfolge seiner Kapitelltypen beweist, in einer einzigen zusammenhängenden und nicht allzu langen Bauführung errichtet worden sein, und das heißt, daß er schwerlich vor der Mitte des 11. Jahrhunderts begonnen sein kann, da seine Kuppel 1128 anähernd vollendet und 1150 ganz fertig war (vgl. unten)j. Viertens sprechen allgemeine Gründe geschichtlicher und kirchengeschichtlicher Art dafür, daß das Baptisterium zur Zeit Papst Nikolaus II. entstand. Diese von Horn angedeutete Auffassung, über die er weitere Aufsätze ankündigt, habe ich 1935 in einem noch unveröffentlichten Aufsatz entwickelt und diesen Aufsatz seinerzeit Horn zu Verfügung gestellt. Sie wird jetzt in dem Mitt. Inst. Florenz veröffentlicht (Jahrgang 1940).</p>

<p>(13) Die Regierungsdaten Rainers sind dessen Grabschrift entnommen (abgedruckt bei Swoboda, Baptisterium, 1918, 4). Dieses Grabmal und das verwandte, 1096 datierbare Grabmal des Grafen Wilhelm Bulgarus, der Cilla und des Uguccione in der Badia a Settimo, sowie die 1093 datierte Fassade der Collegiata in Empoli, – diese ganze sicher datierte Denkmälergruppe aus den neunziger Jahren des 11. Jahrhunderts ist der wichtigste HInweis daruf, daß das ähnlich inkrustierte Baptisterium im späten 11. und frühen 12. Jahrhundert entstanden sein muß. Swoboda hat freilich versucht, einen stilistischen Unterschied zwischen dieser Gruppe und dem Baptisterium zu konstruieren und dadurch das letztere für eine Schöpfung der zweiten Hälfte des 12. Jahrhundert zu erklären. Seine Beweisführung läßt sich aber durch die einfache Beobachtung widerlegen, daß das Grabmal Rainers 1113 vor die bereits fertige Wand gesetzt wurde, und daß die Inkrustationen seines Sockels auf die Basen der angrenzenden Säulen Rücksicht nehmen, daß die Architektur des Erdgeschosses von S. Giovanni, damals also bereits vor­handen war. Das Quadratmuster des Sockels ist auf eine Ausdehnung be­rechnet, die kleiner ist als die Ausdehnung des Sarkophags. Das umgekehrte wäre natürlich. Die Unregelmäßigkeit läßt sich nur dadurch erklären, daß man von vornherein auf die Säule Rücksicht nahm, deren Basis den Platz in der Sockelzone beengte. Vgl. dazu jetzt auch Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 111.</p>

<p>(14) Diese Säulen wurden 1117 von den Pisanern aus Maiorca mitgebracht und den Florentinern geschenkt, zum Dank dafür daß sie bei dieser Unter­nehmung gegen die Araber den Schutz der Stadt Pisa übernommen hatten (Giovanni Villani V, cap. XXXI: es standen auch Bronzetüren zur Wahl; Del Migliore, 1684, S. 87). Kugler zuerst vermutete, diese Schenkung sei wohl als Beitrag zur Förderung einer damals in Gang befindlichen, auch in Pisa bekannten Florentiner Bauunternehmung, eben des Baptisteriums, gedacht gewesen (Geschichte der Baukunst II, 58). Diese Deutung bleibt wahrscheinlich, auch wenn die Säulen, wie es geschah, dann nicht eingebaut wurden, was übrigens auch darauf schließen läßt, daß damals das Erdgeschoß, wo sie ihrer Größe nach allein hingepaßt hätten, bereits fertig war (Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 111/112). Sie standen bis 1424 auf dem Platz vor dem Baptisterium (abgebildet auf einer Truhe im Museuo Nazionale), wurden dann von einer Überschwemmung umgeworften, zerbrachen dabei und wurden links und rechts von der eben von Ghiberti neu dekorierten Ostür aufgestellt. Dort sind sie noch heute zu sehen. Vgl. Del Migliore, 1684, 91f.; Rupp, Inkrustationsstil, 1912 8; Swoboda, Baptisterium, 1918, 70; Salmii, Arch. rom., 37.</p>

<p>(l5) Dei Migliore (1684., 87) udd Richa (VI, 8) berichten, um 1128 sei das Kathedralrecht von S. Giovanni auf S. Reparata übertragen und S. Giovanni zur Taufkirche gemacht worden. Lumachi (Mem. stor. 1782, 19, 20) machte auf die vermutliche Quelle dieser älteren Autoren aufmerksam: der Senator Strozzi habe in den Büchern der Calimala-Zunft, der Patronin von S. Gio­vanni, gelesen, daß im Jahre 1128 das Taufbecken vom Dom nach S. Gio­vanni übertragen worden sei. Diese Nachricht erklärt sich, wie U. Midde­dorf nachgewiesen hat (unveröffentlichte Festschrift zum 60. Geburtstag von Arthur Haseloff, 1933) weniger im Zusammenhang mit dem Wechsel der Kathedralrechte als im Zusammenhang mit den Bauvorgängen. Offenbar war der Neubau des Baptisteriums 1128 weit genug gefördert, um den zeitweilig in S. Reparata ausgeübten Taufdienst wieder übernehmen ­zu können. Vgl. dazu neuerdings auch die eingehende Untersuchung bei Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 109/110. – Über die Glaubwürdigkeit der Auszüge Strozzis aus den Akten der Calimala-Zunft vgl. die übernächste Anmerkung.</p>

<p>(16) Vgl. Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 110.</p>

<p>(17) Giovanni Villani berichtet, daß die Laterne 1150 durch die Vorsteher der Calimala-Zunft auf das Gebäude aufgesetzt worden sei (lib. I, cap. LX). Diese Nachricht ist ohne Zweifel zuverlässig. Auch Carlo Strozzi notierte sich in seinen Auszügen aus den seither verlorenen Büchern der Calimala-Zunft dasselbe (Frey-Vasari I, 1911, 328). Vgl. auch Borghini, Discorsi I, 1584, 159, 160, 162, 164 mit falschen Folgerungen; Kommentar bei Richa V, 1757, XI); Del Migliore, 1684, 114 (mit falscher Kritik), Lami, Mon. II, 1758, 943f.; Cavallucci, A. e st. VII, 1888, 9; Nardini, S. Giovanni, 1902, 105; Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, 48; Rupp, Inkrustationsstil, 1912, 80 (mit falschen Ergebnissen); Swoboda, Baptisterium, 1918, 65, 66 (mit zu scharfer Kritik); Beenken, Z. f. b. K., LX., 1926/27, 250f.; Anthony, ARt stud. V, 1927, 105. Genauere Übersicht über alle diese Meinungen jetzt bei Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 104. An der Laterne befindet sich eine Inschrift hagiogaphischen Inhalts, deren Schriftcharakter eindeutig auf eine Entstehung in der Mitte des 12. Jahrhunderts weist (Genaueres be Horn, a. a. O. 104-106). Mit der Laterne wird auch die Inkrustation vollendet worden sein, denn sie wirkt merklich älter als die 1203 datierbare Inkrustation der Apsis (genaue stilkritische Untersuchung jetzt bei Horn, a. a. O., 1938, 108) durch die Tatsache, daß im Jahre 1205, gelegentlich der Übertragung einer Reliquie des Apostels Philippus nach S. Giovanni, der Marmorschmuck des Gebäudes als dessen Hauptruhm bezeichnet wird (Geschichte von Florenz I, 1896, 737; Forschungen z. G. Florenz I, 1896, 146, 461f.; Swoboda, Baptisterium, 1918, 1). Davidsohn und nach ihm Frey (Vasari I, 1911, 580) haben die Worte des Textes von 1205 willkürlich nur auf die Inkrustation des Inneren Bezogen, anstatt auf den ganzen Bau. Daß dieser in seiner heutigen Gestalt wirklich schon um 1150 fertig dastand, bestätig uns auch die Meinung der Chronica de origina civitatis, die bereits im frühen 13. Jahrhundert S. Giovanni als eine Schöpfung aus altchristlichen, also längst vergangenen Zeiten behandelte (Swoboda, 1918, 64). – Die Kuppelkonstruktion scheint sich während des Baus oder blad nach seiner Vollendung als unsicher erwiesen zu haben. Man mauerte deshalb angeblich die Belastungssporen höher udn schwerer auf und verdeckte diese Zufügung mit einem Attikageschoß. So vermutete jedenfalls Supino, ausgehend von der Beobachtung technischer Unterschide an den Sporen, und Salmi stimmte ihm zu (Gli Albori, 1906, 44ff.; Arch. rom. 37) Mir bleibt etwas unklar, wie man sich dann den ursprüglichen Bauplan für das Dach zu denken hat. Infolge der starken Vorwölbung der inneren Kuppelschale würde ein tiefer als heute ansetzendes Pyramidendach seine Spitze beträchtlich oberhalb der heutigen Laterne gehabt hahben müssen, würde also übersteil ausgefallen sein, oder aber die Kuppel würde, wie in Pisa, hindurchgewachsen sein. Beides scheint mir schlecht zu dem strengen Klassizismus des Florentiner Baus zu stimmen. Vielleicht war die Attika also doch von Anfang an geplant und Supinos Beobachtungen müssen anders gedeutet werden. Stilistisch mußte die Inkrustation der Attika ja so­ wieso am meisten entwickelt ausfallen, da sie am spätesten entstand. Die obere Randlieste ist eine Zufügung des 14. Jahrhunderts (vgl. unten). Seit­dem ich diese Zeilen 1934 niederschrieb, hat Horn die Hypothese eines älteren Daches bündig widerlegt (Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 148ff.).</p>

<p>(18) Vgl. darüber Wackernagel, Lebensraum, 1938, 24, 200, 218, 220, 221. - Näheres siehe Anm. 19, Schluß.</p>

<p>(19) Die ältere Literatur nahm an, der Bau habe als Marstempel ein einziges Portal gehabt, das Westportal, und dieses sei dann samt seiner Vorhalle der Verwandlung in einen christlichen Tempel zum Opfer gefallen; damals sei im Westen die Apsis angefügt worden und damals hätte man die drei Portale im Süden, Osten und Norden eingebrochen (Giovanni Villani, lib. I cap. LV; Vasari I, 334; Borghini, Discorsi I, 1584, 159; Hübsch, Die altchristlichen Kirchen etc. 1862, Spalte 42; Geschichte von Florenz, I, 1896, 737; Forschungen z. G. Florenz, IV, 1908, 461). Borghini, setzte diese Veränderungen als erster in spätere Zeit, und zwar ins Jahr 1150, offenbar unter Mißdeutung der Villani-Nachricht vom Bau der Laterne. (Bocchi-) Cinelli datierte den Vorgang um das Jahr 1200 (1677, 26) und Richa rückte ihn ins Jahr 1202, unter Hinweis auf eine entsprchende, vom Senator strozzi kopierte Eintragung in den Büchern der Calimala-Zunft (V, 1757, XVIII, XXXIII, mit genauem Wortlaut). Vielleicht beruht schon Cinellis Datum auf Kenntnis dieser Ricordanz; vgl. ferner Forschungen z. G. Florenz I, 1896, 146. Die Echtheit der Strozzi-Nachricht ist mehrfach bezweifelt worden. Nardini focht sie aus irrigen stilkritischen Gründen an (S. Giovanni, 1902, 80, 81ff., 84ff., 86, 87, 90, 96, 97; A. e st. VII, 1888, 133). Frey wies darauf hin, daß die Bücher der Calimala-Zunft erst 1207 begonnen wären, und daß Strozzi an anderer Stelle eine nachweislich flasche, dem Vasari nachgeschiebene Behauptungaus derselben, also zweifelhaften, Quelle entnommen haben wolle (Loggia de’Lanzi, 1885, 64; Vasari I, 1911, 328, 329, 578). Ich halte Freys Einwendungen nicht für stichhaltig. Auch wenn die Bücher der Calimala-Zunft erst 1207 begonnen wurden, mag man in sie Erinnerungen an kurz vorher vorgefallene Ereignisse eingetragen haben; und Strozzi kann sehr wohl die knappen Angaben der Baubücher durch “Tatsachen” illustriert haben, die ihm aus Vasari geläufig waren; erst er , nicht seine Vorlage, hat offenbar die irrige Kompilation vorgenommen. Stützen kann man das Datum 1202 auch von anderer Seite her; ein Jahr später wurde dem Baptisteriumeine hochbedeutende Reliquie geschenkt, der Arm des Apostels Philippus (Lumachi, Mem. stor. 1782, 45ff.); sollte der Umbau der Apsis schon damis in Zusammenahng gestanden haben? - Ich halte also das Datum 1202 für zuverlässig und finde es auch durch den Stil der Inkrustation und der Bauskulpturen an der Scarsella, sowie durch das Angansdatum der Mosaiken, 1225, bestätigt (vgl. auch Swarzenki, Rep. f. Kw. XXIX, 1906, 521; und Swoboda, BAptisterium, 1918, 21). Die Apsis ist 1202 freilich nicht entstanden, sondern sie wurde verändert. Sie hatte bis dahin einen halbkreisförmigen Grundriß, wie die Ausgrabungen erwiesen haben (vgl. den Bericht bei Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, 52, 53, 62, tavola IV); durch die Auffindung dieser Fundamente wird Hübsch’s Vermutung, die Scarsella sei keine spätere Zufügung, zum Teil bestätigt (Die altchristlichen Kichen etc. 1862, Spalte 42). Supino nimmt irrtümlichan, die halbrunde Apsis gehöre zum ersten, langobardischen Bau, die Scarsella aber zum Bau des 11. Jahrhunderts. Das wird widerlegt von der durch denselben Autor gemachten Beobachtung, daß die runde Apsis in Verband mit dem inneren, erst dem 11. Jahrhundert angehörenden Mauerring der Fundamente steht. – Richtige Datierung bei Poggi (Riv. d’A. VII, 1910, 77). Swoboda nahm einleuchtend an, man habe die runde Apsis ins Eck übertragen, weil man gewölbte Flächen schwer habe inkrustieren können (BAptisterium, 1918, 69); vgl. auch die irrigen Hypthesen Rupps (INkrustationsstil, 1912, 52, 53) und Salmis (Arch, rom. 35). – Von der Erbauung der Scarsella ist die von den älteren Autoren damis verknüpfte angebliche Einbrechung der drei Portale abzutrennen. Eine solche Maßnahme hat nie stattgefunden. die Portale gehören dem ursprüglichen Bauplan an (vgl. Baubeschreibung und Horn, Mitt. Inst. Florenz V, 1938, 142/43; vgl. auch Anm. 61). – Davidsohn entnahm willkürlich aus Dokumenten des 14. und 15. Jahrhunderts, daß man bei ERbauung der Scarsella im Osten ein neues Atrium angelegt habe; der Wortlaut der von ihm angeführten Stellen beweist, daß es sich um den Domplatz handelte (Forschungen z. G. Florenz IV, 1908, 461). - In der Zeit der Erbauung der Scarsella ist das Vorhandensein der Opera di S. Giovanni unter Leitung eines Operaio Arduinus bezeugt; anscheinend hatte die Calimala-Zunft diese Opera schon 1157 spätestens unter ihren Schutz genommen; möglicherweise handelte es sich dabei um eine Maßnahme der Regierung zur Sicherung der Erhaltung des gerade von ihr fertiggestellen Bauwerks; vgl. über diese Fragen: Frey, Loggia de’Lanzi, 1885, 133; Geschichte von Florenz I, 1896, 737; Forschungen z. G. Glorenz I, 1896, 145, 146; Cocchi, Chiese, 1903, 40; Poggi, Riv. d’A. VII, 1910, 78, 83ff.; Frey-Vasari I, 1911, 328; Salmi, Arte XVII, 1914, 275; Lami, Mon, II, 1758, 1449.</p>

<p>(20) 1207 ist der Fußboden von S. Miniato datiert, der &amp;118 derselben Zeit und Werkstatt stammen muß wie der Zodiakus und zugehörige Teile im Fußboden von S. Giovanni; vgl. Swoboda, Baptisterium, 1918, 16f. – Richa bemerkt fälschlich, um 1200 sei am Fußboden gearbeitet worden; damals habe man den Zodiakus umgelegt, der vor 1048 entstanden sei (V, 1757, XXIVf.). Vgl. auch Lumachi, Mem. stor. 1782, 26f.</p>

<p>(21) Genaueres unter Ausstattung. ‘Ober die Opera und ihre Leiter in dieaer Epoche vgl.

VI, cap. 34; Geschichte wn Flcmmz, II, 333; Kallab, Vasaristudien, 1908, 305, 306; Frey-Vasari I, 1911, 665.</p>

<p>(23) Giovanni Villani berichtet im Buch III, Kapitel 3 seiner Chronik über diese Maßnahme folgendernmaßen: “nel detto tempo si feciono intorno a S. Giovanni i pilastri dei gheroni del marmo per l’arte di Calimala, che prima erano di macigno”. “Gheroni” (= Sporen) sind die dreieckigen Felder des Pyramidendaches, wie Nardini gezeigt hat und wie es der Wortgebrauch der Dokummente über die Dachrestaurierungen des 14. und 15. Jahrhunderts unwiderleglich bestätigt (vgl. Nardini, A e st. VII, 1888, 131 132; vgl. Baugeschichte weiter unten). “I pilastri dei gheroni” sind also die Pfeiler an den Ecken, die die Dachdreiecke stützen. Alle anderen Deutungen sind falsch (vgl. etwa Bocchi-Cinelli, 1677, 27). Vasari deutete den Wortlaut Villanis irrtümlich dahin, daß damals die gesamten Außenwände inkrustiert worden seien, und diese Meinung wirkt bis auf unsere Tag nach (Vasari I, 285f.; Dei Migliore, 1684, 65, 89; Foll.-Rastr. III, 1794, 9; Del Rosso, Ricerche, 1820, 50; Hübsch, Die altchristlichen Kirchen etc. 1862, Spalte 42; Gruyer, Les oeuvres d’art de la Renaissance italienne au Temple de St. Jean, 1875, 25, 26; Geschichte von Florenz I, 1896, 737. – Dagegen vgl. Fantozzi, Guida, 1842, 356; Cavallucci, A. e st. VII, 1888, 9/10; Nardini, S. Giovanni, 1902, 26 ff., 30 ff.; Frey-Vasari I, 1911, 580, etc. etc.). Vasari schrieb die Inkrustierungsarbeiten dem Arnolfo di Cambio zu, und diese Attribution wird durch die Tatsache gestützt, daß Arnolfo in den strittigen Jahren Dombau­meister war, also wohl auch die Opera des dem Domkapitel gehörenden Baptisteriums leitete (Fey, Loggia, 1885, 69; Frey-Vasari I, 1911, 575; anscheinend dem widersprechend die Äußerung in Thieme-Becker II, 1908, 138). Für Arnolfos Urherberschaft spricht auch der pisanische Schichtencharackter der Inkrustation, der dann für die Pfeiler der arnolfianischen Domfassade charakteristisch werden sollte (dagegen äußerte sich Nardini, Il Campanile die S. Maria del Fiore, 52f.). – Unsicher ist die Zeitstellung dieser Arbeiten. Villani nennt das Jahr 1293. Aber Frey weist überzeugund darauf hin, daß man die Pfeiler kaum vor der Beseitigung der Gräber in Angriff genommen haben könne, d. h. nicht vor 1296 (Vasari I, 1911, 575). Über die Beseitigung der Grabmonumente vgl. “Verlorene Ausstattung”. – Sicher falsch ist die lange geglaubte Vermutung, Arnolfo habe einen ursprüglich vorhandenen, dann versunkenen Stufensockel unter dem Gebäude durch ein einfaches Profil erstzt (Del Migliore, 1684, 89). Die Ausgrabungen haben klar erwiesen, daß ein solcher Stufensockel nie vorhanden war. Vgl. die Tafel IV bei Supino, Gli Albori, 1906, und “Rekonstruktion”. Das Sockelgesims scheint aber von Arnolfo erneuert worden zu sein.</p>

                <h3>Hitting the Ground Running</h3>
                <p>June 6th, 2019</p>

<p>Since arriving in Florence, we’ve really hit the ground running. Although there’s been a few setbacks - San Miniato wasn’t open when we thought it would be, and we had great difficulty figuring out where to get a tessera for our Kunsthistorische Institut IDs - but we’ve taken an astounding number of photos of the exterior and inner courtyards of Santa Croce.</p>
