<!-- Image may be left blank if we don't have something for the page
  Collections (where the essay goes) are as follows:
    contributors
    people
    buildings
    artworks
    locations
    texts
  Place the essay in the appropriate folder on GitHub
  Categories are collection-dependent (i.e., they are more arbitrary and we can set them to what we like) The collection "people" includes "painter," "sculptor," "patrons," "historians," etc. Choose what you think is most appropriate (Cosimo de' Medici could be under "politician" or "patron," but he might fit better under the latter since he was so involved in the art scene.)
  Only put "active" in the status header when the page is ready to view publicly--we can actively write and contribute to pages together without having them show up online.
