## NAME

“S. Maria Novella: so named in opposition to older Marian churches.”
“S. Maria della Vigna: so named on the occasion of 1221 - apparently because of the location in
the vineyards.”

## BUILDING HISTORY

S. Maria Novella is the head/main office of the Dominicans [in rel. to the Dominican Order] in
Florence.

### Church
A chapel named S. Maria Novella was first mentioned in 983 [CE], in front of the city walls in
the vineyards.

In the last thirty years of the 11th century, a parish church was constructed nearby with the same
name and was consecrated by Bishop Rainer on October 30th, 1094 [CE] with the participation
of the Cathedral chapter. Since then, the church and chapel of S. Maria Novella existed side by
side. In its neighborhood a bell tower and Monastery for the Dominican Order were probably
erected. These, originally the patrons, were gradually deprived of their rights in the following
decades by the flourishing parish community.

Barely a century after the victory of the citizens, on November 9, 1221, their parish priest had to
give up in favor of the Dominicans from S. Maria Novella. The [Dominican] Order had already
gained a foothold in Florence three years earlier. From Badia a Ripoli he had first moved to the
Hospital of S. Pancrazio and then had made attempts to obtain the churches of S. Paolo or S.
Pancrazio - in vain, since the secular clergy objected. As a result, the leader of the monks, John
of Salerno, had proposed S. Maria Novella and enforced his proposal (7). The solemn investiture
took place on November 8, 9 and 12, 1221, by the actual author of the change of possession, the
Cardinal Legate Ugolino (7), who had obviously recognized the importance of the young order
for papal politics and promoted the establishment also in other ways such as by having
monastery rooms prepared. However, the church remained unchanged for the time being. Soon
(1244) it was no longer sufficient to meet the needs [of the monks], as the pious began to flock to
the heretical sermons of the monks, especially Peter of Verona (later Saint Peter Martyr) (8).


Probably at the instigation of the newly elected, 27-year-old, highly talented Prior Aldobrandino
Cavalcanti (9), the plan for a comprehensive new building was then made. In April 1246, as can
be seen from a letter of indulgence issued by Pope Innocent IV, the construction was already in
full swing (10). In 1250 the pope renewed the indulgence (11). At that time, the transept with the
choir chapels were built, as the first main part of the women’s church, which was planned in its
basic features according to today’s [middle 20th century CE] construction methods. It was the
first monumental building in the gothic style in Florence and became the high school for the
numerous places of worship that grew up in the second half of the 13th century and gave the city
a completely new face. As per tradition, it is unknown who directed the construction. The
findings suggest that the builders came from Cistercian circles and from the earliest Tuscan and
Umbrian mendicant architects (14). The construction was carried out in the following stages: 1.
Construction of the first floor of the transepts and the choir chapels, progressing from west to
east; 2. Construction of the upper walls of the transept and the main choir chapels (in the eastern
arm the founder, Aldobrandino Cavalcanti, found his last resting place in 1279); 3. The main
choir chapel and the transept were vaulted, the entrance arcades of the country house were built,
the Strozzi chapel was added; around this time the Romanesque church was demolished, which
had been left for the time being for worship south of the newly rising walls (15).

In all probability, this decisive step forward took place in 1279, when the Cardinal Legate Latino
Frangipani, Bishop of Ostia, laid the foundation stone of the “new church” of the preaching
monks with great solemnity in eternal memory of the reconciliation he had brought about
between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines. Contrary to tradition, this message, which was written
down two centuries later by Giovanni Villani, should not be interpreted on the basis of the
findings of the building and the situation of the inscriptions, and on the basis of the documents
(16).

The building work was now promoted with great speed; the monks and the burghers clearly
intended to outdo all similar churches in Italy with this work (17). In 1295, 1297 and 1298 the
city government gave money for the undertaking (18). The construction of the new large square
in front of the façade began as early as 1287 (19): the foundation walls of the church may
therefore have already existed in their entirety at that time. In 1297 there was already one - and
probably not only one - of the "avelli" (tombs) on the east side of the cemetery wall (20). In 1298
the first and second bays in front of the crossing (with the monks' choir) were in use, in 1300/
and 1305 the 3rd and 2nd bays (counted from the façade) (21). In 1298, the Minerbetti family
probably also made a donation for the construction of the eastern aisle (and perhaps other parts)
(22). Soon afterwards, the nave may have been essentially completed. The façade was begun
around 1300 (23). That was the most important part.

The main features of the completed work were then gradually completed. A bell tower is
mentioned as early as 1305, but the current one was not built until 1330 at the expense of the
Dominican Archbishop Simone Saltarelli of Pisa (24). Between 1303 and 1325, the Rucellai
Chapel was built in front of the eastern transept (25). Around 1350, the lower half of the façade was encrusted with marble; the donors were Turino Baldesi and Fra Minia Lapi (26). Around 1350 - 60, Mainardi Cavalcanti had the present sacristy built in the angle between the western
transverse arm and the country house (27). The master builder of the bell tower, the façade and
the sacristy was most likely the then head of the building lodge, Fra Jacopo Talenti da Nipozzano (d. 1362), to whom the monastery necrology attributes "large parts of the church" (28). On April 20, 1358, a lightning strike thru the spire and the crowning marble angel down onto the adjacent roofs; the damage was repaired in 1359 (29). In 1420, Pope Martin V celebrated the solemn final consecration of the church during a visit (30).

Around 1456 ff. the extension of the façade was continued. Giovanni di Paolo Rucellai had
Giovanni Bettini execute the famous Renaissance façade based on designs by Leone Battista
Alberti, which covered the Gothic ground floor with a monumental order and newly incrusted
the still bare upper floor (31). Completion date: 1470 (inscription).

In 1462 and 1466, repairs were made to the roof and the bell tower (32). Between 1472 and 1497
construction of the Capella "della Pura" (in the angle between the eastern transverse arm and the
nave) on behalf of the Ricasoli family (33).

Around 1508, Giuliano da Sangallo extended the inner side choir on the left transept at the
behest of the Gondi family; upper parts of the altar wall in 1602 (34).

In 1565-72 Vasari "reformed" the church in the taste “The victim who is able to articulate the
situation of the victim has ceased to be a victim: he or she has become a threat.”
of the late Renaissance: the monks' choir in the last two bays of the nave was removed, a row of
monumental altar tabernacles was added to the side aisle walls (one tabernacle in each bay), the
furnishings were rearranged (35), the large eastern side portal on the nave was walled up and a
new, smaller portal was opened north of it (36).

In 1575-78, Giovan Antonio Dosio extended the outer side choir on the left transept on behalf of
the Gaddi family (37).

In 1616, the entrance wall to the sacristy (south wall of the left transept) was given a façade by
Gherardo Silvani or Fabbrizio Boschi (38).

In 1778, the crumbling crabs were removed from the edges of the spire and the spire was given a
Baroque finish (39). In 1838, further restoration work was carried out on the bell tower (40).

In 1857-61 the church was thoroughly and rather haphazardly restored. In particular, the window
sills were raised in order to replace the Vasari tabernacles with large neo-Gothic altars (41). In
1893, the bell tower, which had been altered over time, was restored to almost its original state
(42). 1904 Exposure of the previously built-in choir (43). 1914 Opening of the walled-up windows of the Cappella Rucellai (44). In the same year, replacement of the weathered stones of
the façade (45). 1922 Addition of the previously unfinished eastern volute to the façade (based on the pattern of the western one) (46).

### Cloister

There is a great deal of information about the history of the monastery buildings, but it is often
inconclusive. The building survey provides results that also lack the ultimate clarity. There is a
complete lack of thorough stylistic-critical preliminary work, as well as precise plans and
measurements. The following attempt can therefore - especially for the period before 1300 - only
claim the value of a working hypothesis.

In 1197, a "claustrum" is mentioned next to the Romanesque church (47); this probably referred
to the same buildings that Cardinal Ugolino had a commission of rich patrons make makeshift in
1221 and 1222 for the purposes of the new Dominicans (48).

In 1246, a comprehensive new building was begun (49). Significant news from 1250 and 1252
report on the extent of the work: according to this, the outermost limits of the present monastery
complex were already reached at that time - at least through the purchase of land (50). The
grandiose system of mighty cloisters framed by many adjoining buildings thus probably
originated from the same time and the same circle as the church project, which was supported by
the same spirit.

Of course, its construction took a good hundred years. Around 1250, the lower arcade of the All
Saints' Chapel was apparently built at the point where the Romanesque cloister met the left
transept of the newly built Gothic church (51). A little later, probably a second addition to the
Romanesque system: expansion of the passage between the present sacristy and the present
"Spanish Chapel" - probably also an attempt to give the passage between the oldest chapel and
the Romanesque church a monumental form (52). Around 1270, perhaps the first beginnings of a
Gothic cloister: construction of the first bay (counted from the east) of the north wing (the later
chapel of SS. Filippo e Jacopo) of the current "Chiostro de'Morti" ("Chiostro Vecchio"), possibly
also of the entire northern cloister wing of this courtyard, roughly by demolishing the
Romanesque cloister; around 1279/80, probably a continuation of this undertaking: construction
of the Strozzi Chapel and the east wing below (53). This was the beginning of the system of
corridors and burial chapels, which was then gradually extended further north. 1284/85 Building
activity in the southern outer parts: on the later "Chiostro dell'Infermeria" (master builder: Fra
Albertino Cambi, called Mazante), in the area of the later pharmacy, on the Laudesi brotherhood
building (at the main gate) and on the "school" of the Laudesi brotherhood located there (54).

Around this time, the monastery still seems to have consisted of two separate main parts: the
already renovated "Chiostro Vecchio" next to the transept of the new church and the farm
buildings to the south (55).

The completion of the church building freed up funds to create the connection between these
parts, which had presumably been planned for a long time. Work began on the wing of the
building to the south-north, which would later be joined by the "Chiostro Grande" to the west
and the "Chiostro Verde" to the east: 1303-1308 Construction of the new chapter house, later
known as the "Capitolo del Nocentino"; the "Chiostro Grande" was probably begun at the same
time, although it was not effectively promoted until later (56). In the meantime, other projects
were carried out, namely certain extensions to the main entrance and the "Chiostro Vecchio": in
1318/19 the school and the hostel (57), in 1323 the cemetery wall (58), around 1330 probably the
Strozzi-Trinciavelli chapel near the bell tower that had just been built (59). It was not until
1332/34, with the construction of the large chapel of St. Nicholas, the foundation of Dardano
Acciaiuoli, that the focus returned to promoting the buildings on the "Chiostro Grande" (60).

It was precisely at this time that the Dominicans' building activities were given a new impetus by
a natural event that initially seemed damaging, the flood of 1333. The reference to the
destruction caused by this put the monks in a position to appeal particularly effectively to public
charity (61). Finally, the "Chiostro Grande" was energetically continued: resumption and gradual
completion of the new dormitory "begun long before", which is probably to be thought of above
the "Capitolo del Nocentino" and north of it (62); construction of the cloister arcades on behalf
of Archbishop Simone de'Saltarelli of Pisa (+1344), Johannes Tuccii de'Infangatis (+1348) and
others (63). - This work was probably already supervised by Fra Jacopo Talenti, who had been in
charge of the building workshop since around 1330 (63).

At that time, the "Chiostro Vecchio" also began to be remodeled again. 1338/1340 Establishment
of a library in the north wing, probably by Jacopo Talenti, on the basis of a donation from the
Baldesi (64). 1340-63 Addition of the transverse wing of the row of tomb chapels behind the two
western side choirs (65). At the same time (1349-63) decoration of the north side and perhaps
also the east side of the "Chiostro Vecchio" (66).

It was at this time that building activity in the monastery reached its peak. A series of favorable
circumstances had come together: the plague of 1348 had made the townspeople extremely
interested in ecclesiastical undertakings and eager to make sacrifices; a highly talented prior, the
famous preacher and scholar Fra Jacopo Passavanti, had managed to win over the favorable
mood for his enterprise; and a capable architect, Fra Jacopo Talenti, was ready to give the
planned undertakings a monumental form. In this way, the monastery project conceived a
hundred years earlier took shape in a grandeur worthy of the spirit of its original inventors. The
most beautiful monument to this heyday is the "Chiostro Verde" with its annexes, the large
refectory and the new chapter house (the "Spanish Chapel"). - Construction began around 1344;
Buonamico di Lapo Guidalotti, a wealthy friend of the prior, donated a new chapter house to the
monks, the choir of which was to serve as his burial chapel. The old chapel of S. Maria Novella,
the forerunner of the Romanesque church, was sacrificed for this purpose; the chapter house with
the first arcades of the "Chiostro Verde" in front of it was completed before 1355 (67). The other
sides of this cloister were completed around 1360 on behalf of other families, as was the refectory to the west of the "Chiostro Verde", which was also begun around 1350 (probably as a
replacement for a somewhat older building donated by Prior Michele dei Pilastri?) (67).

In the same decade - around 1356 - the large north wing of the "Chiostro Grande" with the huge
dormitory ("della Cappella") extending into the "Chiostro Vecchio" and the library were also
built (68). Fra Jacopo Talenti was most probably the director of all these buildings (69). A
novitiate was built above the refectory, followed by an adjoining dormitory (on the "Chiostro
Grande", on the upper floor of the south wing), built between 1364-1383 at the expense of Fra
Alessio Strozzi (70). This marked the end of building activity during this period.

In the 15th century, a gradual expansion of existing parts followed. 1418-20 Construction of a
west wing as a papal hostel for Martin V; Ghiberti and Giuliano Pesello provided competing
designs for this (71). Around 1424 installation of a small cloister in front of the south front of the
refectory and renovation of the infermeria by the then (1424+) prior and Dominican general
Lionardo Statii Dati (72). 1434

Remodeling of the papal apartment for Eugene IV (73). Around 1500 Addition of an
(unfinished) upper storey above part of the loggia of the "Chiostro Grande" (74). 1505
Renovation of the "Chiostro della Porta": creation of the Renaissance cloister between the
monastery entrance and the "Chiostro Dati" (75). In 1504, the papal apartment was refurbished
for Leonardo da Vinci, who drew his cartoon of the Battle of Anghiari there (76), and in 1515 for
Pope Leo X (77).

Vasari brought about important changes in 1563 ff. on the orders of Grand Duke Cosimo I: the
papal apartment was given to the nuns of the newly founded monastery della SS. Concezione and
renovated for this purpose; the confraternity of S. Benedetto Bianco, which had been expelled
from these rooms, was compensated by the installation of an oratory and cloister in the "upper
cemetery" (78); the chapel wing behind the side choirs of the church was transformed into an
entrance to the new monks' choir in the main choir chapel (79). The beautiful staircase near the
Infermeria (designed by Vasari himself?) probably dates from this period.

This was followed by several smaller conversions in the 17th century (80).

In 1814, the papal residence was returned to S. Maria Novella (81). A few years later, another
major destruction took place. During the construction of the railroad station, some chapels at the
"Chiostro de'Morti" were demolished and the monastery garden was turned into a public square
(82). Restoration work had already begun. The "avelli" (burial niches) in the enclosing wall of
the "upper" cemetery, which had almost completely disappeared over time, were renewed in
1847 (83). Further, rather intrusive restorations were renewed in 1847 (83). Further, rather
intrusive restorations: 1892/94, 1912, 1914, 1915/16 (84) and 1921/29 (85).

The bell tower. Its original helmet was crowned with a cross flower and a figure of an angel and
decorated with crabs on the edges (97).

The monks' choir ("Tramezzo"). Until 1565/72, the original monks' choir in the form of a high-
walled rectangle clamped between the pillars stood in the last two bays of the central nave. For
more details, see "Lost furnishings" p. 734.The monks' choir façade was adjoined on both sides
by a grille in the side aisles, so that the rear part of the church, which served the monks' service,
was separated in its full width from the front part, the preaching church of the lay
congregation.The separating barrier and the entire monks' choir zone are called "Tramezzo" (98)
in the source writings (14th-16th centuries).

The side altars. Vasaris. 1565ff. erected on the side aisle walls, replaced 1857ff. To be presented
like the corresponding, still preserved altar series in the nave of S. Croce. The capitals were
composite (98a).

The "upper cemetery". Located to the east of the nave of the church (in the angle between the
eastern aisle and transept); demarcated from Piazza S. Maria Novella and Via degli Avelli by an
enclosing wall with "avelli" (burial niches); see Wood-Brown, 1902, 101f.On the northern third
of this medieval cemetery, consecrated in 1323, adjacent to the "Cappella della Pura", there had
been a cloister, the "Cortile della Pura", since the 15th/17th century, and on the rest of the site to
the south, the building complex of the brotherhood of S. Benedetto Bianco since 1570ff. All
these buildings were removed in 1867 (for floor plan and reconstruction, see S. Benedetto
Bianco, Vol. I, 354f.), and the surrounding wall was rebuilt in neo-Gothic style. Until 1847, in
place of the present neo-Gothic portal, there was a portal by Ghe-rardo Silvani (17th century;
illustrated in Ricci, Cento vedute di Firenze antica, 1906, plate XCI; see also note 80).
Its extensive buildings have been restored to some extent to their original state. The original
purpose (or location) of the individual parts can be seen from the "Building History" and from
the plan on p. 693. It should be emphasized that this monastery complex was probably the
richest, the most complete in Florence, that it probably came closest to the ideal of a complex
that took all conceivable purposes into account. There were (in addition to the usual buildings)
infirmaries, a pharmacy, a school, library rooms and a hostel.

The hostel; 1318/19. Located at the entrance to the monastery in Piazza S. Maria Novella.

#### *Chiostro Verde*
Until the construction of the cloister (around 1350), there was a garden here that belonged to the
monastery, but apparently not to the cloister - above the Gothic loggia of the cloister there was
later an upper, Baroque loggia with pillars and basket arches, which probably dates from the 17th
century (see note 84).

#### *Chiostro de'Morti*
Originally there was probably a Romanesque cloister, and from the mid-13th century to the mid-
14th century perhaps a Gothic cloister loggia running around all four sides (cf. note 66) - For the
reconstruction of the demolished buildings to the north of the Chiostro de'Morti, which are
described below, see the plan on p. 693.

Chapel of St. Benedict of the Tornaquinci (plan no. 18); probably built in the late 13th century -
see Wood-Brown, 1902, 99.

St. Paul's Chapel of the Alberti (plan no. 10). Built in the late 13th century, rebuilt in 1565, see
Wood-Brown, 1902, 100, 105, 108.

Brunelleschi Chapel of St. Lawrence (plan no. 11). Built soon after 1333 as the Simon Thaddeus
Chapel of the Brotherhood of S. Gesù Pellegrino. Rebuilt in 1565, see Wood-Brown,
1902,106,108.

St. Martin's Chapel of the Nelli (plan no. 12). Built before 1347, rebuilt in 1565, see Wood-
Brown, 1902, 106/07, 108.

Building of the Confraternity of S. Gesù Pellegrino (plan no. 14). Built around 1347, located to
the north opposite the last three chapels mentioned. The entrance was exactly opposite the Lrenz
chapel. Behind it was a small cloister. From its north-west corner you entered a Anteroom.
Behind this was the oratory (plan no. 15). Cf. Wood-Brown,1902, 107/08; the whole is depicted
on the city view by Stefano Bonsignori (1584) (reproduction in Mori-Boffito,Piante e vedute di
Firenze).

Chapel of the Stigmata of St. Francis (patrons: Alfieri-Strinati). Built in 1363, it is located
approximately at the place numbered 13 on the plan. Vgl.Wood-Brown,1902,108.
Garden wing of the dormitory (?) Such a building is shown on the plan from the Baroque period
(no. 21).

Monastero del Capitolo". The oldest chapter house, built in 1244, was located on Via Valfonda -
probably in the extreme north-east of the monastery district - where the Tertiaries of the
Dominican Order - "Pinzocchere di Penitenza" - had built a small convent in 1308. Cf. Wood-
Brown,1902,77.

The dormitories at the "Chiostro Grande" (plan no. 29 and 30). They were originally three-aisled
pillared halls, without the cell walls already shown on the plan, which were probably added in
the 16th or 17th century - For the staircase (no. 28), see note 65 - On the upper floor above the
west end of dormitory no. 30 is the "Cappela del Papa", built in 1418-20.

The "Pope's hostel" (plan no. 31). A series of rooms that the city government had built as a hostel
for distinguished guests in 1418-20, located on the upper floor of the west wing of the "Chiostro
Grande"; accessible through the associated chapel (cf. (see previous section), also by a staircase
at the south end (from the Via della Scala), allegedly also by a flight of steps built according to a
design by Lorenzo Ghiberti or Giuliano Pesello in 1418-20, on the lowest post of which the city's
heraldic lion, Donatello's "Marzocco", sat (this flight of steps is said to have been located in the
west wing of the cloister of the "Chiostro Grande" [?])(99). In 1434 the halls were rebuilt and
columns were erected above the entrance on the Via della Scala to support a protective roof.
Cf.Wood-Brown,1902, 90ff.-The flight of steps has been demolished, the inn completely
disfigured by later alterations


## BUILDING DESCRIPTION

### Church

Type. Three-aisled Gothic pillar basilica with transept and five adjoining square choir chapels, of
which the central one is twice as large as the others.- Since the terrain under the church slopes
slightly from east to west, and since the older cemetery was to be preserved under the church, an
artificial base had to be built under the western half of the church to compensate for this; it partly
contains burial vaults (cf. Wood-Brown, 1902, 96).
#### *Outside.*
South-north-facing Gothic quarry stone building; most of the structure is made of house stone
(Macigno), a smaller part of brick. Marble incrustation on the façade.

#### *Facade.*
Its structure corresponds to the basilica cross-section of the nave behind it: a lower, wider part
rises up to the height of the side aisles; above its center rises the front wall of the upper aisle
(with a pediment), flanked by two volutes. The lower part has two storeys, a high ground floor
and an attic. All parts are richly clad in white, red and green marble. - Components from two
different construction periods and styles overlap and intermingle: Gothic parts, which were
created around 1350 (probably by Fra Jacopo Talenti), and Renaissance parts, which were
created in 1456-70 according to a design by Leone Battista Alberti. The older parts dominate the
lowest storey of the façade up to the base of the attic. The younger parts intertwine with the older
ones on the ground floor; on the upper floors, only they are present.

The Gothic sections have an ancient appearance, almost in the spirit of the great architects of the
late Dugento and early Trecento (100). Its model could have been the façade of S. Paolo in
Pistoia, a creation of Giovanni Pisano's building school from 1313; in addition, the Florentine
cathedral façade by Arnolfo di Cambio probably also had an inspiring effect - the central section
has been replaced by Alberti's main portal. On either side of it, four narrow, high wall bays are
divided by slender pilaster-like pilasters supporting four semi-circular blind arches. At the
bottom of each wall bay is a pointed-arched burial niche ("avello") (100a); in the two bays that
lie beneath the flanking walls of the upper aisle, two slender pointed-arched portals, each with a
low wimperg, open in its place. The vertical structure is intersected by a horizontal one: at the
bottom, a fairly high, richly and finely profiled base; above this, the band of ornamented
sarcophagus fronts of the tomb niches, interrupted by the portals; at the height of the transom
points of the niche arches, profiles that cross the pilasters; above the pointed arches, a cornice
that cranks over the pilasters; below the crowning blind arches, a row of capitals. On the pointed
arches of the tomb niches, the wedge stones are alternately green and white; the white wall
panels above the niches are patterned with green rectangles (101); two rows of these rectangles
follow one another; the rectangles of the upper row end in semicircular arches at the top.

The Renaissance parts: most important building photos: Laspeyres, Die Kirchen der Renaissance
in Mittelitalien, 1882, XI;Stegmann-Gey-müller, Architektur der Renaissance in Toscana, IIIa,
11, 12 (102).Leone Battista Alberti attempted to extract an antique composition from the existing state of the building: he gave the already incrusted ground floor a new rhythm by installing a monumental "order" of three-quarter columns; he designed the remaining area above as an attic; while he thus echoed the antique triumphal arch scheme on the lower, broader part of the façade, he gave the lower part of the façade an antique triumphal arch scheme.

He gave the still undecorated front of the upper arcade the shape of a temple front. However, he
was unable to fulfill the Renaissance demand for axial justice, as he adopted the Gothic system
in which the flanks of the upper arcade have the portal openings below them. In place of the
(three?) Gothic central bays, a mighty niche-like portal opens with a pilaster-studded jamb and a
round arch designed as a coffered barrel vault. Flanking it are two colossal columns set into the
wall and two corresponding columns further to the left and right, directly next to the green and
white (horizontally) striped corners (widened to form strong pillars). An antique entablature rests
on the capitals of the columns and corner pillars and at the same time on the intervening apexes
of the Gothic blind arches as the conclusion of the lowest story of the façade; above this follows
the attic, a white zone with juxtaposed green striped squares, each of which has a rosette etc. in
the center - similar to the decorative squares above the gallery of the baptistery; the striped
corner pillars of the first floor continue at the corners. On the front wall of the upper aisle, the
marble cladding forms a composition in the style of an ancient temple façade, which is depicted
using the Florentine incrustation style: four pilasters (horizontally striped in green and white)
divide three wall bays and support an entablature above which a pediment rises. In the middle,
wider wall panel, the older, Gothic rose window (too low-set); in the gable, the sun-like Jesus
emblem; on the frieze of the entablature, the name of the founder and the completion date 1470
in large Antiqua letters; the white wall panels are divided by green rectangular strips, each of
which contains a green star pattern in the middle. Two volutes serve as spandrels between the
front of the clerestory and the wider lower part of the façade - for the first time in the history of
architecture, a motif that was to conquer the architecture of Europe from here. The shape of the
volutes is inspired by the buttress volutes on Brunelleschi's cathedral dome lantern; rich
incrustation ornamentation on each volute, each dominated by a Gothic rose.

The main portal was executed by the sculptor Gio-vanni di Bertino and his workshop; the
"imprese" of the Rucellai family (sails) and the Medici family (ring with feather), who were
closely associated with them, are attached there and to the relief and encrusted frieze under the
attic as leitmotifs (103).

*Nave*; around 1279-1310.

*Three-aisled basilica*. Very simple structure, in striking contrast to French Gothic and in close
connection with Italian-Romanesque building habits. The side aisles and the clerestory are
divided into wall bays by pilaster-like buttresses, each containing a window (ogival windows in
the side aisles, lancet windows in the clerestory). At the top of each nave a round-arched frieze,
which is cranked over the buttresses on the side aisles (not on the central nave); lion heads as
gargoyles on the crankings.The front, somewhat younger bays (after 1300) have slightly different
window and frieze profiles than the last two bays in front of the transept, which are somewhat older (around 1278-1300).- On the east side in the third bay, a later (around 1300), now walled-up, magnificent side portal (103a) in the type of a richly varied round-arched pillar-pillar portal.

#### *Transept and choir chapels; around 1246-79.*
Basic features. The two transepts, the crossing between them and the adjoining main choir chapel
are somewhat lower than the central nave of the nave; chapels of much lower height are placed
in front of the transepts all around, with a strong corner pillar of rectangular base at each corner
of the end walls of the transepts and the main choir chapel (104). A frieze of pointed arches on
consoles runs around the transverse arms and the main choir chapel (including corner pillars) at
the height of the upper wall end, above which rise the three low gables of the end walls and on
the corner pillars cube-like tops with small, baroque pyramid helmets (the latter are missing on
the eastern transverse arm, however w(here blind arches are attached to the cube tops instead).

The three end walls of the transverse arms and the main choir chapel are the most richly
structured. On all the gable slopes there are Cistercian-style brick console cornices - on the main
choir chapel there are three lancet windows joined together in a group (the central one higher)
with a small rose window above each lancet - also a Cistercian motif (105). The fact that all
these windows are held together by a huge, pointed blind arch and connected to the corner pillars
is idiosyncratic and grand (106). There is a recessed cross in the gable and a single pointed
arched window (now walled up) in the east transept, with a rose window above it (107); above
this is a pointed arched blind window (framed by columns) which pierces the cornice at the base
of the gable (108).

The choir chapels: the main choir chapel has already been described; in the rear part of each of
its side walls is a lancet window, which was already walled up during construction due to a
change of plan (109); to the left and right of the main choir chapel are two side choirs half the
size. On their rear wall, buttresses, one between each and a slightly larger one on the exposed
corner of each of the two outer side choirs; they are structured to match the corner pillars of the
main choir chapel (110). A frieze crowns them, forming the upper end of the side choirs. In
contrast to the corresponding but somewhat younger frieze on the main choir chapel and on the
transverse arms, it is made of brick and is quite richly structured: at the bottom a "German band",
above it an arched frieze of columns and pointed trefoils, at the top a cornice (111). - Each side
choir originally had a pointed arch window at the back; only the one immediately to the left of
the main choir chapel has survived. Of the others, the walled outlines are still partially
recognizable, above which a transverse rectangular lancet window now opens in each of the
three chapels - ingredients of the late Renaissance and Baroque periods.

In front of the two western side choirs is the low wall of a corridor that has been laid out in front.
The chapel extensions. The unadorned "Cappella della Pura" (late 15th century) in the angle
between the nave and the eastern transept; the Rucellai Chapel (around 1303/25) with three
masonry lancet windows in front of the end wall of this transept. - The sacristy by Fra Jacopo
Talenti (c. 1350/60) is located at a corresponding angle on the western transverse arm,
surrounded by the monastery buildings; the three pointed arches of the large window in its rear wall (see p. 691 below) are framed by a semi-circular blind arch. In front of the end wall is the high Strozzi Chapel (c. 1279), in which a lancet window opens.

#### *The bell tower; 1330.*
It leans against the southwest corner of the western transverse arm - probably the work of Fra
Jacopo Talenti. Like the other work of the master, the façade, it appears very ancient, almost
Romanesque, and was probably modeled on a building from the late 13th century, the bell tower
of Ognissanti. - It rises above a square base. Its corners are each reinforced with a flat template
and round arch friezes grow out of these corner templates, dividing the four storeys. These
storeys increase in height and openness towards the top. In the lowest, a narrow pointed arch on
each side, in the second a two-part pointed arch, in the third three round arches supported by
columns, in the fourth a corresponding but higher and more open group of sound openings,
above which a slightly projecting round arch frieze forms a cornice. Above each side of the
tower an eyelash gable, between which rises the four-sided helmet; it was renewed in 1778
(112), generally probably fairly faithful.

##### *Interior.*
Monumental Gothic spatial creation, the oldest in Florence, groundbreaking for the beginnings of
Florentine Gothic and always inspiring for its further development, highly significant and fruitful
due to its bold security.

The bold certainty with which a Gothic spatial and structural system with a Tuscan character was
developed from the scheme of the Burgundian Cistercian basilica is highly significant and
fruitful.-Paatz, Werden und Wesen der Trecentoarchitektur in Toskana, 1937,7ff. (113), gives a
detailed account of the historical significance of this development.-The individual parts of the
church are discussed from the choir to the façade, in the order in which they were built. -
Fixtures and additions from later periods follow at the end.

##### *Structural system.*
Articulated pillars (and corresponding wall pillars), pointed arches and ribbed vaults everywhere.
All walls and vaults are made of lightly plastered quarry stone, all structures of gray-brown,
finely worked sandstone (pietra serena).

#### *Choir chapels and transept; around 1246-79.*
The transept is formed by three square bays of equal size: the crossing and the two transverse
arms; at the back of the crossing is the main choir chapel of equal size and design, on either side
of it, half the size, with two square side choirs on each transverse arm; this scheme is taken from
the Cistercian basilicas (114). In front of the side choirs there is a platform of two steps; in front
of the main choir chapel, which is higher again, there is a staircase platform of five steps
projecting into the crossing (115).

The ground floor (c. 1246-65): the side choirs and the equally high lower parts of the main choir
chapel and the transverse arms. The impression is determined by the pointed arched openings of
the side choirs and the square pillars between them on the side choir end walls. At the front of
each pillar is a pilaster, the capital of which is continued on the other parts of the pillar. The
antique-style pilaster motif appears to have been taken from the Romanesque traditions of the
older medieval Italian mendicant orders (116); however, these pilasters were perhaps intended as
a support for (Cistercian-Gothic) models, which were intended to ascend to the transept vaults
(perhaps planned in six parts at the time), but which were not executed in the second
construction phase (117). The ribbon-like, sharply cut acan.thus capitals have a Pisan-
Romanesque character (118). Corner services rise in the transept corners and at the corners of the
opening of the main choir chapel articulated pillars rise up to the vault; the scheme of the latter -
cruciform with corner services and half-columns on the transepts and pilaster-like designs on the
triumphal arch side - is taken from Cistercian models, but developed more sturdily (119). - In
each choir chapel, corner services and a cross-ribbed vault of Cistercian profiling (120). Capitals
figured on the services - a Gothic motif that probably originates from the castles of Emperor
Frederick II (121). The little figures perched on the capitals or clutching them are, however,
entirely Italianate in style, partly in the sense of the Pisan-Romanesque school (in the side choirs
on the left transept), partly in the sense of Niccolò Pisano (in the side choirs on the right transept,
which were apparently completed somewhat later) (122).-The All Saints' Chapel of the Rucellai
in front of the southern part of the end wall of the left transept is clearly one of the oldest parts;
this rectangular room, which was later incorporated into the bell tower built above it, has a barrel
vault and an Italian-Romanesque portal (122a); a marble wall niche in the easternmost side choir;
it is divided by a small column with a jonised capital and bears two Gothic trefoil arches;
Between the arches and the crowning gable slopes is a finely sculpted tympanum with a tree in
relief in which birds are climbing around - a motif from the central French Gothic of Chartres
(123). The arcades connecting the transept with the nave were only built in the following
construction period (cf. below).

The upper parts (around 1270/79). Of the previously described prefabrications, only the services
in the transept corners continue upwards, but not the pilasters of the side choir entrances, the
latter perhaps as a result of a change of plan at that time, which replaced the six-part transept
entrances that were possibly originally planned.

In each transept and in the crossing there is a square cross-ribbed vault with a Cistercian ribbed
profile; in the end wall of the left transept a simple, still Romanesque-looking eye window; in the
end wall of the right transept a Gothic rose window (124); the work may therefore have been
promoted from left to right. On the capitals of the corner pillars at the front of the main choir
chapel, softly modeled acanthus foliage, richer profiles and half-figures in the style of the

Sienese pulpit by Niccolò Pisano-apparently more recent, refined creations by the decorators,
who also executed the vault consoles in the side choirs on the right transverse arm (125).

#### *The mouth of the nave (around 1279).*
In the south transept wall facing the nave, the central part, which contains the entrances to the
three naves, is slightly further south than the side parts, so that two wall steps run from bottom to
top immediately next to the side aisle entrances, even through the two lancet windows that open
above the side aisle entrances. This inconsistency reveals a new change of plan (the second):
when the construction of the nave began, the central part of the transept was apparently enlarged
slightly to the south and at the same time the nave was built higher than originally intended; the
capitals of the side aisles and the nave arcades are higher than the capitals of the side aisles, and
the clerestory of the nave rises slightly higher than the crossing (126).

#### *The nave; 1279 to around 1310.*
Three naves, each with six bays of different lengths. Between the naves, which are arranged in a
basilica-like arrangement, there are articulated pillars with pointed arch arcades, with
corresponding wall pillars on the side aisle walls and a ribbed vault in each bay of each nave. A
pointed arch window in each side aisle bay (shortened at the bottom in 1857).

In each central nave bay in the clerestory on both sides an eye window. True to Italian
Romanesque tradition, two parts are distinguished in the nave: 1. the lay church or "lower
church", which comprises the four front bays and was probably intended primarily for preaching
in this Dominican building; 2. the tramezzo4 , which is two steps higher and encompasses the
last two bays before the crossing; until 1565/72 it contained the monks' choir in the central nave
and, next to its façade, grilles that closed off the side aisles from the lay church (127).

*The monk's choir zone ("Tramezzo")*; around 1279-90. Executed following the upper parts of the
transept after a change of plan (see above), but by the same builders. As in the transept, the pillar
bases are ancient (Attic), the ribbed profiles are early Gothic. -Following on from Tuscan-
Romanesque buildings, a change in the shape of the pillars distinguishes this part of the nave
from the front part (128). The pair of crossing pillars corresponds to the Cistercian Early Gothic
corner pillars of the main choir chapel on the rear side of the crossing. The next pair of pillars, on
the other hand, is of Florentine-Romanesque design: four half-columns in front of a square core,
arranged in such a way that only narrow corner edges protrude from the core between the
templates, and that one template rises above the others up into the clerestory to the vault belt-this
is the pillar scheme of S. Miniato and very probably also of the older, Romanesque church of S.
Maria Novella, which was only demolished at the time. The next and last pair of pillars again
correspond to the crossing pillars - the pillar and wall pillar capitals and their finely and richly
profiled cover plates correspond stylistically to the forms in the upper part of the transept. A few capitals at the transept entrances have simpler cover plates and ancient Romanesque-Pisan motifs (dragons; medallions with half-figures); they were evidently made during the first construction phase (1246 ff.), but were not moved until long after (1279) (129). - According to Pisan-Romanesque custom, the arches of the tramezzo arcades are painted with a black and white wedge stone pattern.

The central aisle bays here are transversely rectangular, the side aisle bays longitudinally
rectangular - similar to some Italian Cistercian churches (130).

*The lay house (the "lower church")*; c. 1290-1310. The structure here is generally the same, but
all the pillars are of the same type, the Tuscan-Romanesque of the central pair of pillars in the
"Tramezzo", albeit somewhat modified into the mathematically abstract in accordance with the
tendencies of the late 13th century. The edges between the half-columns are developed on three
sides by chamfering, and the corners of the lower plinth below the bases are chamfered by
downward-facing "tongues". The ribbed profile corresponds to the three-sided cross-section of
the pillar edges. The capitals have coarse, herbaceous acanthus foliage and unprofiled cover
plates. - The bays are longer, so that their ground plan approaches a square in the central nave
and an excessively elongated rectangle in the side aisles - but without regularity, so that the
individual bays are of quite different lengths (131).

Due to the height and width of its arcades and the slight elevation of its clerestory, the nave
space appears wide, open and hall-like, almost in the sense of late Nordic Gothic. This effect was
probably achieved by following the example of Tuscan-Romanesque, pseudo-basilical rooms
(132), and was striven for more and more decisively, especially in the youngest part, the "Laien-
haus": there the merging of the different parts of the room is further enhanced by chamfering the
edges of the pillars and the ribs. Again, in an almost late Gothic manner, the mighty room is
given solidity by the unity of simple, large wall surfaces, it is given life by the play of forces of
the calmly powerful, soaring forms of the pillars, arches and windows and by the picturesque
play of the shifting lights and shadows. Nevertheless, it ultimately appears different from the late
Gothic halls of Central Europe. The organic physicality of the column-like pillars is original.
**Urflorentine** and at the same time completely Dominican in its vivid unity, the plausible logic of
this strong, simple, sweeping, ascending system of members (133). The dynamics of this
Romanesque type of pillar, clamped together with Gothic pointed arches in the service of Gothic
vaults, are incomparable: the intimate connection with the Gothic construction gives it something
urgent that allows the force of the formal energies concentrated in it to be fully felt – it is no
wonder Michelangelo particularly loved and praised this church (134).

#### *Additions and extensions.*
They are described in the same order as the furnishings: side altars in the nave; a neo-Gothic
altar tabernacle in each aisle bay, 1857/61.

##### *Chapel "della Pura"; around 1472ff.*
Situated in the angle between the nave and the right transept. Rectangular room with two
spherical vaults. In the inner corner the altar of the image of grace, a marble tabernacle in the
style of the tabernacle of the image of grace in the SS. Annunziata: a column and two pilasters
support a vault and an ornamented ceiling; the whole is perhaps the work of Giovanni di Bertino
(135). Since 1841 it has formed the northernmost bay of a neoclassical portico by Baccani
running along the western wall of the chapel; on the opposite wall a corresponding portico, also
built in 1841.Rucellai Chapel; between 1303 and 1325. Located in front of the end wall of the
right transverse arm, above a vault; accessible via an open staircase. Irregular transverse
rectangular room with a ribbed vault (136).

##### *Gondi Chapel (first side choir on the left transept)*;
built by Giuliano da Sangallo around 1503/08 (137); the only surviving example in Florence of Giuliano's late Roman-Classical style,
which was so decisive for the development of the High Renaissance and Mannerism (138). Dry
execution. On the altar wall, triumphal arch-like marble cladding, a large round-arched niche
(138 a), flanked by two pilaster-framed narrow side bays, each containing a statue niche at the
bottom, with an entablature and a circular recess above; mensa with balusters. On each of the
side walls, a three-part bench on sarcophagi decorated with skulls with a three-part backrest,
which is divided by acanthus-decorated armrests and columns and decorative panels standing on
them (white marble frame, columns and sarcophagi in black marble, the fillings in red marble;
Tuscan capitals with rosettes and egg-and-dart). - Giuliano's architecture only covers the lower
half of the walls. The upper part of the altar wall was covered in Baroque style in 1602 by order
of Simone Gondi (139).

##### *Gaddi Chapel (second side choir on the left transept)*;
built by Giovan Antonio Dosio 1575- 78 (140).-Ground plan, elevation, details etc. in Stegmann-Geymüller, Architektur der Renaissance
in Toscana, IX a, 1896, Figs. 3 and 4, Plates 4 and 6.-Main work of the classicist direction in
Florentine late Mannerist architecture, unique due to the restrained richness of the decoration. In
each wall there are two recessed corner columns; between them a sarcophagus below (a mensa
on the altar wall) and an aedicula above. Dosio has understood how to lend a beautiful
tranquillity to these Michelangelesque, densely packed motifs through tactful treatment; he has
also been able to unfold the full splendour of colorful incrustation on the aedicules and the
magnificent floor without somehow appearing over-rich, just as he has wonderfully sensitively
harmonized the individual elements - architecture, sculpture and painting (141), space and body,
surface and color.Pietra dura work and ceiling stucco based on Roman models, one of the oldest
examples in Florence (142).Strozzi Chapel (at the front of the left, western transverse arm,
higher than the transverse arm: above the vaults of the cloister); around 1279; longitudinal
rectangular room with ribbed vaulting on corbels; a lancet window in the rear wall.

##### *Rucellai Chapel of All Saints;*
c. 1246 ff. - To the left of the Strozzi Chapel. VgL above p. 685.

*Facade of the sacristy (south wall of the left transept)* by Gherardo Silvani or Fabbrizio Boschi,
1616 (143). Late, particularly interesting example of Michelangelesque "architectural sculpture" in the sense of Buontalenti.three-door system with bizarre individual forms. Next to the main doorway are two pilasters with a bracket covering; above them are two gnarled, diverging pediment fragments that develop out of an inverted shell; above them is a bracket-covered lunette and a pediment as the upper end of the central section. Above the lower side doors, shell volutes and box-like fields.

*Sacristy* (in the angle between the left transverse arm and the nave); by Fra Jacopo Talenti;
around 1350. Longitudinally rectangular room with pointed ribbed vault on (neo-Gothic?) corner
consoles (144); in the south wall a large, tripartite Gothic window of the type of the window in
the main choir chapel: the central pointed arch rises higher than the two lateral ones, above each
of which an eye is attached.

### Upper Cemetery
This is the name given to the walled area between the nave, the right transverse arm, Piazza S.
Maria Novella and Via degli Avelli in memory of its medieval purpose; its south and east walls
facing the square and the street are clad in white and green marble. The series of burial niches
("avelli") that decorates the lowest part of the adjacent church façade continues here: at the
bottom a finely profiled plinth, above which the sarcophagi are placed side by side (ornamented
at the front), above each sarcophagus a niche consisting of two low pillars and a pointed arch
with white and green wedge stones, above which a low wall and a white and green horizontal
stripe.This avello system is also repeated on the inside of the enclosing wall and on the eastern
flank of the church longhouse around the cemetery. Next to the church façade and the "della
Pura" chapel there is a higher arch as a portal - the whole was almost completely renovated in
1847 and 1861 ff, but probably more or less faithful to the remains of the original state (145).

#### CLOISTER
Photographs of the building. Older in a of the Uffizi drawing collection (146). Newer floor plans
in Wood-Brown, 1902.- Cf. also our illustration on p.693.

Preliminary remark. Due to their large number, the monastic buildings can only be described in
outline here, especially as many of them have been preserved in poor condition and are
inaccessible. The location of the parts described can be seen from the ground plan mentioned
above.

##### *The entrance.*
The monastery façade is located in Piazza S. Maria Novella and adjoins the church façade at a
right angle to the south. It consists of a wall designed to resemble the surrounding wall of the
"upper cemetery", which was probably almost completely renovated around 1847/61: burial
niches ("avelli") and green and white marble incrustation. Directly next to the church façade a
small portal, further south a larger one. - Behind the wall is an unadorned rectangular forecourt.
Behind the adjoining western wing of the

##### *Chiostro della Porta.*
Rectangular cloister, 5 x 5 round-arched Ionic column arcades in sober High Renaissance forms.
Due to its location, it can be tentatively identified with the "Chiostro della Porta", which is said
to have been built in 1505. - If you turn back to the forecourt from here, a passageway along the
western flank of the church leads first to the "Chiostro Verde" (see below) and from its northern
side to the "Chiostro Vecchio".

##### *Chiostro Vecchio or Chiostro dei Morti.*
Originally the monks' cemetery; the oldest part of the monastery, built on the site of Romanesque
buildings in the later 13th and 14th centuries. The layout is due to the Romanesque buildings that
have disappeared.

The entrance from the Chiostro Verde is a vaulted corridor between the church sacristy, where
the Romanesque church once ended, and the "Spanish Chapel", where the pre-Romanesque
chapel once stood. Wide, flat, arched ribbed vaults on wall consoles decorated with foliage;
around 1279 (147). - In the right (eastern) wall remains of older buildings: at the entrance
masonry from the Romanesque church (148); at the far (northern) end under the All Saints'
Chapel attached to the church a walled pointed arch from a formerly open pillar arbor (the
substructure of the chapel; soon after 1246); an associated second arch is in the chapel wall to the
right of the aisle at an angle to the right (149). - The Strozzi-Trinciavelli Chapel (c. 1330) at the
left end of the aisle; it lies at an angle between the main room and the choir of the Spanish
Chapel and opens with a pointed arch to the aisle and another pointed arch to the Chiostro dei
Morti; the arches rest on a free-standing corner pillar; according to tradition, this chapel was
already present before the Spanish Chapel was built, and its ancient profiles also speak for this.
The cemetery; around 1280/90. Behind the Strozzi-Trinciavelli chapel, the passage continues
under the other Strozzi chapel in front of the transept (150). To the left, it opens like a cloister
towards the cemetery with segmental arches on sturdy octagonal pillars standing on a low wall
(151); to the right, it is accompanied by a row of chapels, most of which are also located under
the last-mentioned Strozzi chapel and lean against the front wall of the transept with their rear
sides. They contain ribbed vaults (partly round-arched, partly ogee-arched) and now only open
towards the cloister (with one arch each), but originally also opened to the side (also with
arches), so that the row of chapels must have acted like a second nave of the cloister. At the end
of each partition wall between two chapels there is a slender octagonal pillar as a remnant of this
system. The corridor with the row of chapels now runs into a wall in the north

The aisle with the row of chapels now ends at a wall in the north, but continued there in the past
(152), with a Renaissance loggia with Tuscan columns above its Gothic ground floor. - On the
north side of the cemetery there is a building that shows hardly any traces of its original state; in
its south-east corner there is a capital of the type of the entrance con-soles, further west a
corresponding capital, and above both (connecting them) a walled arch: here a Gothic chapel
apparently originally opened; perhaps there were once other chapels adjoining it - on the west
side of the cemetery a modernized building. - On the south side is the wall of the Spanish
Chapel. Between it and the west wing is an intermediate building with an ancient cornice - perhaps the remains of a monastery built here before the Spanish Chapel. To the east, next to the
choir of the Spanish Chapel, is the Strozzi-Trinciavelli Chapel already described; above it are the
western parts of the "Stanza dei Beati", a room accessible from the transept of the church. To the
south of the entrance to the "Chiostro Vecchio" is the "Chiostro Verde".

##### *Chiostro Verde*
So called because of its gray-green in gray-green frescoes, built around 1350-60, probably by Fra
Jacopo Talenti. The most beautiful Gothic cloister in the whole of Florence - one of the most
perfect embodiments of the Italian Trecento architectural ideal thanks to the harmony of its space
and forms. - Square in plan. On each side, five round arches open on eight-second pillars resting
on a small wall (153); the central arch on each side is a segmental arch, i.e. wider, and the small
wall is interrupted underneath it; in this way, four central openings are created, emphasized
architecturally, which allow passage from the loggia to the garden in the middle; in the loggia,
the bays are square, the ribbed vaults are round and octagonal; the spatial proportions are
unusually balanced. The single-piece forms are also structured with exquisite sensitivity: on the
pillars, delicately profiled plinths and strong leaf capitals (154), on the bows, a painted black and
white wedge stone pattern (renewed in the 19th century) and painted zigzag bands on the ribs of
the vault. The following buildings frame the cloister:

##### *The Spanish Chapel (on the north side).*
So called since about 1540, when Duchess Eleonora of Toledo assigned it to the Spaniards in
Florence as a national chapel (155); originally the main room served as a chapter house, the choir
chapel as the family and burial chapel of Buonamico di Lapo Guidalotti (156). The whole is
probably the work of Fra Jacopo Talenti (157). In the façade, a portal opens (as is usually the
case with Gothic chapter houses) between two two-part cloverleaf arched windows with seven-
pane tracery; the portal and windows are unusually richly and delicately ornamented (158).
Behind it is the transverse rectangular main room, covered by a huge round-arched ribbed vault
rising from four low five-sided corner pillars.All the parts of the room, the walls and the system
of members seem to merge imperceptibly into one another to form a softly modeled whole; this
is the most perfect fulfillment of the architectural ideal that the Dominican builders of S. Maria
Novella had first striven for in the nave of the church, and a top achievement in the interior
design of the entire Italian Trecento (159). The chancel chapel was structured in line with the
main room, but was altered somewhat in the late 16th century, when the entrance arch in
particular was removed.

*The south wing.*
It now contains the monks' apartment and is inaccessible (160).

##### *The Capitolo del Nocentino and the refectory.*
Together they form the west wing of the cloister. The "Capitolo" is located in the northern end of
this wing; it was built in 1303-08 and is a rectangular, almost square room with a round-arched
ribbed vault on four five-sided corner pillars (161).

The large rectangular hall with round-arched ribbed vaults on the corner and wall pillars; it was
built in 1350-60, probably by Fra Jacopo Talenti. Its structure is based on that of the neighboring
"Capitolo del Nocentino" and differs from it only in the richer profiling of the capitals. The tree
effect is simple and powerful (162).

##### *Chiostro Dati*
So named after the famous Dominican order general and prior of S. María Novella Lionardo
Dati, who inscribed himself next to the scroll consoles as the founder ("Leonardus generalis").
Situated to the south in front of the southern end wall of the refectory just described, built around

1424. One of the earliest and most ornamental architectural monuments of the nascent early
Renaissance: cloister with all-round slender round-arched columned arcades, ribless cross vaults
and still somewhat Gothically stylized, loosely composed acanthus capitals (column bases and
portals largely renewed). In the south wing, a broad, finely sculptured Gothic wall fountain
façade.

##### *Chiostro Grande*
Huge cloister, the largest in medieval Florence; located to the west of the Chiostro Verde,
accessible through a passage from its northwest corner. Built around 1303/40, it now belongs to
the Scuola sott’ufficiale Carabinieri.

The loggia is modeled on the (older) "Chiostro Vecchio": octagonal arcades with octagonal
pillars on pedestals, octagonal ribbed vaults. However, the pillars are slender like columns,
making the cloister appear more delicate and transparent (163). Above the north wing and the
adjoining north half of the east wing of the gothic loggia rises a disproportionately high upper
loggia with Tuscan columns and round arches - an addition from the second half of the 15th
century.

The framing arcade, which encloses the cloister on all four sides, is largely inaccessible. In the
southern half of the east wing there are two rooms already described, the refectory and the
"Capitolo del Nocentino". Separated from them by the passage leading from the "Chíostro
Verde", in the northern half of the east wing on the ground floor is a large Gothic hall (c. 1333 f.)
with three naves, two rows of columns and ribbed vaults. On the upper floor of the east wing
there used to be a large dormitory, which has now been largely consumed by more recent
additions; on the ground floor of the north wing there is a second dormitory (164), a large Gothic
hall of the same type as the hall in the northern half of the east wing; it is now disfigured by
more recent additions. Before the profanation, the following rooms were located above it
(following one another from east to west): the large library hall, extended in 1629 by Matteo
Nigetti and provided with a rich portal; two reading rooms; a dormitory; the "Cappella del Papa",
which belonged to the adjoining papal apartment (165); the chapel is still preserved, the other
rooms have probably been disfigured by alterations. The entire west wing was occupied from
1419 by the guest house, which was used for popes, princes and other distinguished guests of the monastery and the Florentine government and was incorporated into the SS Concezione nunnery
in 1563/92 and rebuilt for this purpose (166); only a few pointed arch windows in the east wall
have been preserved from the old forms; the interior is inaccessible. The south wing now
contains the "Museo del Risorgimento"; on its ground floor are the simple, somewhat restored
rooms of the former "Infermeria", the infirmary (extended in 1428?), and a rich portal by Matteo
Nigetti, 1612, which once belonged to the monastery pharmacy (167). A beautiful staircase leads
to the upper floor, allegedly by Giorgio Vasari, around 1560 (168). The upper floor originally
housed the novices' dormitory; it was later divided into smaller rooms. One of them, facing only
the cloister, has been decorated with stucco since the 18th century. Stairs and stucco decorations.
To the west of the last room is the former St. Nicholas Chapel of the Acciaiuoli from which the
outside of the wall in this room is decorated with an arched frieze and a rich Gothic two-part window.

The chapel was built in 1332 and is inaccessible today; it probably has the shape of a rectangular
hall. It has a sacristy, which can be reached from the Museo del Risorgimento through a
courtyard ("Chiostro dell'Infermeria"). The chapel originally served as an oratory for the
infirmary and was later incorporated into the buildings of the monastery pharmacy.


## FACILITIES

The church and monastery of S. Maria Novella, with their richly decorated interior, are among
the most important artistic monuments in Florence. The monastery, with its picturesque sequence
of richly decorated larger and smaller courtyards, chapels and other buildings, gives an
impressive impression of the intellectual and artistic intensity of the Florentine Trecento and
early Renaissance in general, and of Dominicanism in particular, in its seclusion and tranquility.
A historical overview of the decoration of the church and monastery during the 15th and early
16th centuries can be found in Wackernagel, Lebensraum, 1938, 43 ff.

### Interior
The best of the church's original furnishings have been preserved, in particular frescoes and
tombstones from the 13th century. A series of altarpieces of the Mannerist school in the side
aisles owe their creation to the Wasari Reform of 1565/72, which was commissioned by Grand

Duke Cosimo I to remove the monks' choir and systematize the formerly forced arrangement of
the side aisle furnishings, and the associated stone tabernacles were replaced by neo-Gothic ones
in 1861. At the same time, for the sake of greater "uniformity", the tombstones in the floor were
arranged in two rows, the windows were decorated with stained glass by the leading architect
Enrico Romoli and the painter Giuseppe Fattori and neo-Gothic blind doors were set into the side
aisle walls as frames for confessionals (171).

#### *Facade wall.*
At the top center rose window with stained glass, *Coronation of Mary*, framed by praising
angels; perhaps executed by monks from Ognissanti according to designs by Andrea Bonaiuti da

owned by Boni and consecrated to Jeh. d. T. Acquired by Filippo Strozzi from the Boni in 1486
and probably dedicated to St. John and the Apostles Philip and James (221); since then under the
patronage of the Strozzi.

Frescoes. On the walls scenes from the legend of St. Philip and St. John the Evangelist as well as
allegorical figures of virtues and muses, the interpretation of which is not possible everywhere;
in the vault Old Testament figures; late major work by Filippino Lippi. Important as the first

flying angels, made of white marble. - Floor from 1261 (228).

#### *Main choir chapel*

Ghirlandaio, Mainardi, Bartolommeo di Giovanni and Benedetto del Ghirlandaio (?). Cleaned in
1907; new restoration underway since 1938(231) The frescoes are famous as a classic depiction
of Florentine patrician life in the time of Lorenzo il Magnifico; they contain many portraits. The
identification of individual persons is based on information provided in 1561 by Benedetto di
Luca Landucci, then eighty-nine years old, on the basis of his youthful memories (232).
Description (from bottom to top due to the order of the paintings): Right wall, in the lowest strip
on the right *Annunciation to Zechariah*, dated 1490, the *Visitation*; in the second strip on the

field is white glazed. Executed by Sandro di Giovanni d'Andrea Agolanti, 1491 (233), after a
design by Domenico del Ghirlandaio.
Choir stalls. The upper row of seats is the youthful work of Baccio d'Agnolo, completed in 1490
(234); it was probably originally a circumferential bench with a smooth back wall enlivened by
pilasters and inlay work. Disfigured by additions: Armchairs and folding seats, made in 1566 by
Giovanni Gargiolli on behalf of Vasari (when the monk choir was relocated) (235). The large
music stands are a few decades younger.

White marble Easter candlestick (on the left triumphal arch pillar) in the form of a twisted
column with foliage and putti in the coils; an outstandingly beautiful work from the last third of
the 14th century, attributed to Piero di Giovanni Tedesco (236); probably more in the style of
Simone di Francesco Talantí. The Easter Leaper is a subsequent imitation by Giovanni Battista
Giovanmerzf,1804(7) (237).

#### *Western transept*
##### *First left side choir.*
In 1264 (7) Fra Ranieri, known as il Greco, may have established a cult here to his patron saint,
St. Luke. In 1325, the chapel was acquired by Margherita Tornaquinci, who belonged to the
Guardi and Scali families; since then it has been called Cappella Scali. In 1461 it was ceded to
the della Luna family by Donna Costanza de' Salviati, widow of Bartolommeo degli Scali; this
agreement was annulled in 1466. In 1503 the chapel was transferred to Leonardo, Giovanni and
Federigo Gondi, the sons of Giuliano Gondi (240). In 1508, Giuliano da Sangallo had it extended
on their behalf.
In the vault, remains of the old painting, the four Evangelists; by a Byzantine painter, around
1270, probably donated by Fra Ranieri; uncovered in 1932 (241).

Target architecture by Giuliano da Sangallo, c. 1503/08; added in 1602 (cf. p. 689f.). In the pair
of niches in the altar wall, two statues of angels, by Francesco Gargiolli (?), around 1602 (242).

Renaissance sculpture, allegedly created to surpass Donatello's crucifix in S. Croce, but probably
created earlier than the latter, around 1400/1410 (234).

#### *Western Crossarm*

Luke. In 1325, the chapel was acquired by Margherita Tornaquinci, who belonged to the Guardi
and Scali families; since then it has been called Cappella Scali. In 1461, it was ceded to the della

pair of niches in the altar wall, two statues of angels, stucco, by Francesco Gargiolli (?), c. 1602
(242). In the center, a wooden crucifix by Filippo Brunelleschi; a famous masterpiece of early
Renaissance sculpture, allegedly created to surpass Donatello's crucifix in S. Croce, but probably
created earlier than the latter, around 1400/1410 (234).

##### *Second left side choir.*
Apparently dedicated to St. Dominic; the patronage was given to the Falconi family early on;
they consecrated the chapel to St. Michael the Archangel and all the angels. In the 16th century,
the patronage was given to the famous humanist Niccolò di Sinibaldo Gaddi. He had the chapel
consecrated to St. Jerome (243) and had it extended by Giovan Antonio Dosio (for the
architecture, see p. 690). Uniform furnishings around 1575/78.

### Lost Features
#### _The pre-Romanesque Chapel_
(before 983, demolished around 1350, see page 672)

Features unknown. Perhaps attached to it were the two _stone reliefs_ depicting Madonnas, which
are now located in the passage between the Chiostro Verde to the Chiostro dei Morti (see page
723f and note 322). – A _painted crucifix_ has also been associated with the chapel (373).

#### _The Romanesque Church_
(completed in 1094, demolished around 1279; see page 673)

_“Upper altar” (High altar?)_ , consecrated in 1094 to the Madonna and St. Agatha (see note 89).
Features unknown (perhaps a Madonna painting, in which the Madonna offers a representation
of the old Madonna seal of S. Maria Novella) (374).
_Side altar_ (in the crypt?), consecrated in 1094 to St. Stephen and Martin (see note 89). Features
unknown.
_Tomb_ of the blessed Johannes von Salerno († 1242), the founder of the Dominican establishment
of S. Maria Novella; most likely a wall tomb with sculpture and fresco painting erected soon
after his death; taken over to the current church during the demolition of the old church or newly
built there; replaced by the current tomb of Vincenzo Danti in 1571; lost (375).
_Frescoes_ in underground rooms (?) (376); lost.
Whether there were _choir screens_ is not discernible (see note 91); and whether a _painted crucifix_
was mounted on them must also remain undecided (see note 373).
No information is available about the features of any _side buildings_. They were probably rather
unremarkable (see page 673).

### The Current Church

#### _Exterior._
##### _Upper nave_. 
In the arches of the pointed arch friezes’ _fresco paintings_ , there are medallions with
half-figures of saints (traces are preserved on the west side).
##### _East side._ 
Next to the small church portal added by Vasari, a fresco of Madonna adored by St.
Therese, by Gaspero Martellini, first half of the 19th century (377); lost. – On the other (?) side
of this door, a _burial niche (Avello) with a fresco_ of St. Zenobius and St. Giovanni Gualberto
praying to the crucifix, 14th century. (378); lost.

#### _Interior_.
##### _In general._ 
The characterization of the condition before the interventions of the 16th and 19th
centuries in Wackernagel, Lebensraum, 1938, 56f. – The original features were dominated by
large cycles of frescoes and the powerful monastic choir, which grew together with the
architecture in the last two bays before the crossing. In addition to the frescoes, one must also
imagine the multitude of diverse altars in casual sequence, the organs, crucifixes, miraculous
images and tombs to get an idea of the variety of features as they had developed over the course
of three centuries.
_The fresco decoration_ originally covered much larger portions of the wall surface. The interior is
said to have been fully painted (379), but probably not according to a uniform plan; this is
contradicted by the variety in subjects painted and times of origins depicted. Apparently, the
painting was carried out under the initiative of individual families. Notably, the paintings mainly
extended to the areas where family altars stood. All choir chapels were painted throughout, but
perhaps not the Cavalcanti Chapel (Sacristy); also, many of the wall surfaces in the side aisles
and the facade well (380). Whether and where the cycle of frescoes with Old Testament scenes,
donated by Turino del fù Baldese in 1348, was carried out, cannot be determined (see note 379).
The frescoes were largely destroyed during the renovations of 1565 onwards.
Vasari erected _stone tabernacles_ in the two side aisles around 1565, composing an arrangement
for altar pictures; they were replaced after 1861 by the current neo-Gothic ones (381).
The _older floor_ , donated and possibly also made by Fra Minia Lapi (1321-76 in the monastery),
was replaced following 1861 (382). In it, arranged irregularly, is a large number of _tomb slabs_ ; in
1861, they were newly laid out in the current regular arrangement (383).

##### _Facade wall._
_Altar_ west of the main portal (initially dedicated to the Holy Three Kings, later probably to the
Annunciation of Mary; patrons: del Lama, then Fedini, at the end of the 16th century
Mondragone, then in the 17th century Vecchietti ) (384). First decoration: marble altar with _panel
painting_. Adoration of the Holy Three Kings, by Sandro Botticelli; painted on commission from
Gasparre di Zanobi del Lama around 1475; now in the Uffizi, No. 882 (385). Above the altar (?)
_fresco_ , Birth of Christ, in the style of Sandro Botticelli, around 1470; following 1857 was
relocated to the arch field of the main portal on the facade wall, see there. – Second decoration:
on the altar since about 1603, the _painting_ of the Annunciation of Mary, by Santi di Tito, painted
for the Spaniard Fabio Mondragone; moved to the Gondi Chapel in 1861, now in the fourth bay
of the left aisle, see there. – In 1857/61, the altar was removed, and in its place, the fresco of the
Trinity by Masaccio was transferred.
_Altar_ east of the main portal (originally dedicated to St. Vincent the Confessor under the
patronage of the monastery; since 1576 under the patronage of the Attavanti, later the Ricasoli;
in the 18th century dedicated to St. Vincent Ferrer) (386). _Painting_ of St. Vincent Ferrer, above
Christ in Glory by Jacopo Coppi, known as del Meglio, now in the 5th bay of the right aisle (see
there). Replaced by the _triptych_ , the Archangel Raphael with Tobias and two saints, School of
Castagno; now in the 5th bay of the left aisle (see there). – In 1857, the altar was removed, and
the Annunciation fresco behind it was uncovered.

##### _Nave._
_On a pillar_ to the right, a temporary _holy water font_ , 1300/02 (see note 414).
_In the third bay_ above the arches to the right and left, _frescoes_ , portraits of Andrea di Niccolò
Minerbetti (Gonfaloniere of 1387) und his wife Francesca; 2nd half of the 14th century (387);
lost.
_Bronze tomb slab_ of Lionardo Dati, by Lorenzo Ghiberti; now in front of the high altar (see
under Features, Nave).

_Monastic choir (388)_
Freestanding in the nave, created by enclosing the last two nave bays before the crossing, open
towards the main choir chapel (see page 674); wholly or partially clad with marble (390); removed in 1565 by Vasari (see Architectural History). On top of the semi-high thick walls,
connected by a passageway, stood four altars, an organ, a lectern, and other features (see below).
The front side (“ponte”) was visibly higher than the flanks. The interior was accessible from the
nave through a large gated arch door, the “reggie,” framed by two altars, and from one side door,
a marble pilaster has perhaps been preserved in the tomb of Tommaso Minerbetti, now in the
fourth bay of the right aisle. Next to each side door outside, there was an altar. The altars on the
“ponte” were positioned against the pillars, facing each other, with their display sides toward the
interior of the choir; likewise, two additional altars, one on the eastern and one on the western
wall.

##### _Facade._ 
East of the entrance, an altar (dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene; patrons: Cavalcanti),
connected with the tomb of Blaxia Cavalcanti, the founder who passed away in 1300; in 1370,
the stone sarcophagus of the recently deceased Mainardo Cavalcanti was also linked to the altar
(392). Altarpiece, polyptych with the Annunciation in the center, saints in the side panels, and
Crucifixion, Flagellation, Resurrection in the three gables; on the predella, Pietà, Church Fathers,
and saints, as well as the coats of arms of the Cavalcanti and Acciaiuoli; probably created for
Mainardo Cavalcanti by Giovanni del Biondo around 1378 (?); following 1565, was transferred
to the sacristy along with the altar and tombs, since 1810 in the Academy, No. 8606 (393). –
West of the entrance, an _altar_ (dedicated to St. Peter Martyr, patrons: Castiglione-Dietisalvi),
erected in 1298, renovated in 1484 (394). Possibly an altar fresco here, the Martyrdom of St.
Peter Martyr, Byzantine-style painting, likely from around 1298; transferred to the passage
between Chiostro Verde and Chiostro Grande in 1572, see there page 723.
_East wall_ (exterior side). _Altar_ (dedicated to St. Thomas à Beckett; patrons: Minerbetti; founded
before 1308 (1298?) by Tommaso di Ruggierino Minerbetti) (395): Panel of unknown subjects,
by Gaddo Gaddi, end of the 13th century; probably removed around 1565, lost (396). Next to it,
probably the two _wall tombs_ of the Minerbetti, now in the 4th bay of the right aisle (see there);
relocated around 1572. – On the same wall, a _fresco or panel_ , St. Jerome, by Taddeo Gaddi, 1st
half of the 14th century (397); probably removed around 1565, lost. Adjacent is the burial place
of the Gaddi family.

_West wall_ (exterior side). _Altar_ (dedicated to St. Thomas Aquinas ; apparently erected in the 1st
half of the 14th century under the patronage of the Guaseoni; passed to the Alfani in 1365 and
dedicated to St. Mark; later as the Catherine Altar under the patronage of the Brotherhood of St.
Catherine of Siena) (398). At times (1494), the panel painting of St. Lucia, possibly by Davide
del Ghirlandaio (?), was likely located here, which is now in the fourth bay of the left aisle (see
there); in 1565, the altar was moved to the west wall of the side aisle; for further details, see the
2nd bay of the left aisle.

_Walkway_ on top of the wall: _Above the central portal_ , presumably the painted _crucifix_ by Giotto,
now in the sacristy, see there. – _On the eastern pillar_ , an _altar_ (dedicated to St. Louis, patrons: Ardinghelli; apparently established simultaneously with the “ponte,” around 1300) (399). Altarpiece, St. Louis of France, at the feet of the saint, the donor couple, by Giotto, around 1300
(400); probably removed around 1565, lost. – _On the western pillar_ , an _altar_ (dedicated to St.
Elizabeth of Hungary, patrons: Macci; erected around 31.1.1339 according to the last will of
Tignoso di Gulaterone de’ Macci; sold to Virgilio Adriani in 1437) (401). Features unknown. –
Next to the two previous altars, an _organ_ , donated around 1330 by Simone de’ Saltarelli,
Archbishop of Pisa; probably renewed or replaced after 1424. On the wings, paintings (panel),
Annunciation, by Fra Angelico, 1st half of the 15th century; removed in 1565, then in the lower
dormitory of the monastery, still present in 1790 (402); lost. – Nearby, likely a _marble lectern_ ,
supported by a sculpted column with Evangelist symbols; probably identical to the paschal
candelabra in the main choir chapel, see there. – _On the eastern side wall_ , in the rear bay, an
_altar_ (dedicated to St. Eustace; probably erected by the brothers Fra Tommaso and Fra Agostino,
sons of Tommaso Gherardini, 14th or 15th century) (403). Features unknown. – _On the western
side wall_ , in the rear bay, an _altar_ (dedicated to St. Peter and Paul) (404). Features unknown.

_Interior: seating_ all around, removed in 1565, lost. In the center, the _bronze tomb slab_ of
Dominican General Lionardo Dati by Lorenzo Ghiberti, now in front of the high altar, see under
Features, Nave.
There may have been additional altars on or in the monastic choir; see the features mentioned on
page 747f and note 468.

_Altar tabernacle_ in marble, erected after the destruction of the monastic choir on the _fourth
eastern pillar_ , commissioned by the sons of Marco Benedetti, designed by Bernardo Buontalenti,
end of the 16th century (405); crowned with a bust of Christ by Giovanni Caccini, around 1598
(406); within a frame, a painting, Martyrdom of St. Peter Martyr, by Lodovico Cigoli, end of the
16th century (407). The tabernacle was destroyed in 1857; the painting initially went to the
Rucellai Chapel, then to the storage of the museums of S. Salvi (408); the bust is lost.

_Altar tabernacle_ in marble, _on the fourth western pillar_ , counterpart to the previous one (patrons:

certain.

created after the transfer to the Scali (Guardi), around 1325 (443). Covered up with white wash
in the 18th century.

“S. Maria Novella ist die Hauptniederlassung der Dominikaner in Florenz.”
P2 (p. 664 - Vol. 3)

### KIRCHE
“Eine Kapelle S. Maria Novella wird zuerst 983 erwähnt (2), und zwar vor den damaligen
Stadtmauern in Weingärten. /
Im letzen Drittel des 11. Jahrhunderts wurde neben ihr eine Pfarrkirche gleichen Namens
errichtet und am 30. Oktober 1094 von Bischof Rainer unter Mitwirkung des Domkapitels
geweiht (3). Seitdem bestanden Kirche und Kapelle von S. Maria Novella nebeneinander fort (4).
In ihrer Nachbarschaft erhob sich wahrscheinlich ein Glockenturm und ein kleines Kloster für
die Dom-Kanoniker (5). Diese, ursprünglich die Patronatsherren, wurden in dem folgenden
Jahrzehnten von der aufblühenden Pfarrgemeinde allmählich um ihre Rechte gebracht (6).” /

“Kaum ein Menschenalter nach dem Obsiegen der Bürger, am 9. November 1221, mußte ihr
Pfarrer freilich zugunsten der Dominikaner aud S. Maria Novella verzichten. Der Orden hatte
schon drei Jahre zuvor in Florenz Fuß gefaßt. Von der Badia a Ripoli war er zunächst ins
Hospital von S. Pancrazio übergesiedelt und hatte dann Versuche gemacht, die Kirchen S. Paolo
oder S. Pancrazio zu erhalten - vergeblich, da die Weltgeistlichkeit widersprach. Daraufhin hatte
der Führer der Mönche, Johann von Salerno, S. Maria Novella in Vorschlag gebracht und seinen
Vorschlag durchgesetzt (7). Die feierliche Einsetzung geschah am 8., 9. Und 12. November
1221, und zwar durch den eigentlichen Urheber des Besitzwechsels, den Kardinallegaten
Ugolino (7), der offenbar die Bedeutung des jungen Ordens für die päpstliche Politik erkannt
hatte und die Niederlassung auch sonst förderte, indem er Klosterräum herrichten ließ. Die
Kirche blieb aber einstweilen unverändert. Bald (1244) genügte sie denn auch dem Bedürfnissen
nicht mehr, da die Frommen den ketzerfeindlichen Predigten der Mönche, vor allem des Petrus
von Verona (des späteren Heiligen Petrus Martyr), in immer größeren Scharen zuzuströmen
begannen (8).”

“Wohl auf Betreiben des neugewählten, 27jährigen, hochbegabten Priors Aldobrandino
Cavalcanti (9) wurde daraufhin der Plan zu einem umfassenden Neubau gefaßt. Im April 1246
war, wie aus einer-”

P3 (665 - Vol. 3)

“Ablaßverschreibung Papst Innozenz’ IV. hervorgeht, der Bau bereits in vollem Gang (10). 1250
erneuerte der Pabst den Ablaß (11). Damals entstand das Querschiff mit den Chorkapellen, als
erster Hauptteil einer Frauenkirche, die in ihren Grundzügen dem heutigen Bau entsprechend
geplant war. Sie war der erste Monumentalbau gotischen Stiles in Florenz und wurde die hohe
Schule für die zahlreichen Gotteshäuser, die in der zweiten Hälfte des 13 Jahrhunderts
aufwachsen und der Stadt ein vollkommen neues Gesicht gaben. Wer den Bau geleitet hat,
verschweigt die Überlieferung. Sicher waren es nicht die seit Vasari immer wieder dafür in
Anspruch genommenen Laienbrüder Fra Sisto, Fra Ristoro und Fra Giovanni da Campi (12) und
ebensowenig andere, erst später ins Kloster eingetretene Mönche (13). Der Baubefund läßt
vermuten, daß die Baumeister aud den Kreisen der Zisterzienser und der frühesten toskanisch-
umbrischen Bettelordensarchitekten stammten (14). - Die Ausführung vollzog sich etwa in
folgenden Abschnitten: 1. Errichtung des Erdgeschosses der Queraeme und Chorkapellen, von
Westen nach Osten fortschreitend; 2. Aufführung der Obermauern des Querschiffs und der
Hauptchorkapellen (im Ostarm fand der Begründer, Aldobrandino Cavalcanti, 1279 seine letzte
Ruhestätte); 3. Einbewölgung der Hauptchorkapelle und des Querhauses, Erstellung der
Eingangsarkaden des Landhauses, Anfügung der Strozzi-Kapelle; um diese Zeit riß man die
romanische Kirche ab, die einstweilen für den Gottesdienst südlich vor den neu aufwachsenden
Mauern belassen worden war (15).”

“Aller Wahrscheinlichkeit nach geschah dieser entscheidende Fortschritt im Jahr 1279. Damals
legte der Kardinallegat Latino Frangipani, Bischof von Ostia, mit großer Feierlichkeit zum
ewigen Gedächtnis der von ihm bewirken Versöhnung zwischen den Guelfen und den
Ghibellinen den Grundstein zu der “neuen Kirche” der Predigermönche. Diese zwei
Menschenalter später von Giovanni Villani niedergeschriebene Nachricht darf wohl, entgegen
der Tradition, nicht auf Grund des Baubefundes und der Situation der Inschriften, und auf Grund
der Urkunden (16).”

“Der Bau wurde nunmehr mit großer Schnelligkeit gefördert; die Mönche und die Bürder
gedachten mit diesem Werk ausgesprochenermaßen alle ähnlichen Kirchen Italiens zu
übertrumpfen (17). 1295, 1297 und 1298 gab die Stadtregierung Geld für das Unternehmen (18).
Schon 1287 begann man, den neuen großen Platz vor der Fassade anzulegen (19): die
Grundmauern der Kirche mögen also damals bereits in ihrem ganzen Umfange vorhanden
gewesen sein. 1297 war schon einer – und wahrscheinlich nicht nur einer – der “avelli”
(Grabnisehen) an der Ostseite der Friedhofsmauer vorhanden (20). 1298 war das erste und zweite
Joch vor der Vierung (mit dem Mönchschor) in Benutzung genommen, 1300/02 und 1305 das 3.
und 2. Joch (von der Fassade gerechnet) (21). 1298 hat auch wahrscheinlich die Familie
Minerbetti eine Stiftung zugunsten der Erbauung des östlichen Seitenschiffs (und vielleicht noch
weitere Bauteile) gemacht (22). Bald darauf mag das Langhaus im wesentlichen gestanden
haben. Die Fassade wurde um 1300 begonnen (23). "Damit war das Wichtigste getan.”

“Das in seinen Grundzügen vollendete Werk wurde dann ganz allmählich vervollständigt. Schon
1305 wird ein Glockenturm erwähnt; der heutige wurde aber erst 1330 auf Kosten des
Dominikaner-Erzbischofs Simone Saltarelli von Pisa errichtet (24). Zwischen 1303 und 1325
entstand die Rucellai-Kapelle vor der östlichen Querhausstirn (25). Um 1350 wurde die untere
Hälfte der Fassade mit Marmor inkrustiert; Stifter waren Turino Baldesi und Fra Minia Lapi
(26). Um 1350-60 ließ Mainardi Cavalcanti die heutige Sakristei im Winkel zwischen dem
westlichen Querarm und dem Landhaus errichten (27). Baumeister des Glockenturm, der
Fassade und der Sakristei war höchstwahrscheinlich der damalige Leiter der Bauhütte, Fra
Jacopo Talenti da Nipozzano († 1362), dem der Kloster-Nekrolog “große Teile der Kirche”
zuschreibt (28). Am 20. April 1358 warf ein Blitzschlag den Turmhelm und den bekrönenden
Marmorengel auf die angrenzenden Dächer herunter; 1359 wurde der Schaden repariert (29).
1420 zelebrierte Papst Martin V. gelegentlich eines Besuches die feierliche Schlußweihe der
Kirche (30).

“Um 1456 ff. wurde der Ausbau der Fassade fortgesetzt. Giovanni di Paolo Rucellai ließ dutch
Giovanni Bettini nach Entwürfen des Leone Battista Alberti die berühmte Renaissance-Fassade
ausführen, durch die das gotische Erdgeschoß mit einer Monumentalordnung überkleidet und das
noch kahle Obergeschoß neu inkrustiert wurde (31). Schlußdatum: 1470 (Inschrift).

“1462 und 1466 fanden Reparaturen am Dach und am GLockenturm statt (32). Zwischen 1472
und 1497 Errichtung der Capella “della Pura” (im Winkel zwischen östlichem Querarm und
Langhaus) im Auftrag der Familie Ricasoli (33).

Um 1508 baute Giuliano da Sangallo den inneren Nebenchor am linken Querarm im Auftrug der
Familie Gondi aus; obere Teile der Altarwand 1602 (34).

1565 - 72 “reformierte” Vasari die Kirche im Geschmack der Spätrenaissance: der Mönchschor in
den beiden letzten Langhausjochen wurde entfernt, eine Reihe monumentaler Altartabernakel an
den Seitenschiffswänden angebracht (in jedem Joch ein Tabernakel), die Ausstattung neu
angeordnet (35), das große östliche Seitenportal am Langhaus vermauert und nördlich daneben
ein neues, kleineres Portal geöffnet (36).

“1575-78 baute Giovan Antonio Dosio den äußeren Nebenchor am linken Querarm im Auftrug
der Familie Gaddi aus (37).”

“1616 erhielt die Eingangswand zur Sakristei (Südwand des linken Querarmes) eine Fassade von
Gherardo Silvani oder Fabbrizio Boschi (38).”

“1778 entfernte man die zerfallenden Krabben von den Kanten des Turmhelmes und gab dem
Helm einen barocken Abschluß (39). 1838 fanden weitere Restaurierungen am Glockenturm statt
(40).

“1857-61 wurde die Kirche gründlich und ziemlich willkürlich restauriert. Vor allem legte man
die Sohlbänke der Fenster höher, um an Stelle der Vasari-Tabernakel große neugotische Altäre
darunter anzubringen (41). 1893 wurde der im Laufe der Zeit veränderte Glockenturm wirder
annähernd in seinen ursprünglichen Zustand versetzt (42). 1904 Freilegung des vorher
eingebauten Chores (43). 1914 Öffnung der vermauerten Fenster der Cappella Rucellai (44). Im
selben Jahr Auswechslung der verwitterten Steine der Fassade (45). 1922 Hinzufügung der zuvor
immer unausgeführt gebliebenen östlichen Volute an der Fassade (nach dem Muster der
westlichen) (46).

### KLOSTER

Die Nachrichten über die Geschichte der Klosterbaulichkeiten sind sehr reichlich, aber oft nicht
eindeutig. Die Bauuntersuchung liefert Ergebnisse, die der letzten Klarheit auch ermangeln. An
gründlichen stilkritischen Vorarbeiten fehlt es völlig, ebenso an genauen Plänen und
Abmessungen. Der folgende Versuch kann demnach – besonders für die Ziet vor 1300 – nur den
Wert einer Arbeitshypothese beanspruchen.

1197 wird ein “claustrum” neben der romanischen Kirche erwähnt (47); damit waren wohl
dieselben Gebäude gemeint, die Kardinal Ugolino 1221 und 1222 durch eine Kommission
reicher Gönner für die Zwecke der neueingezogenen Dominikaner notdürftig herrichten ließ
(48).

1246 wurde ein umfassender Neubau begonnen (49). Über den umfang der Arbeiten berichten
bedeutsame Nachrichten von 1250 und 1252: danach wurden die äußersten Grenzen der heutigen
Klosteranlage bereits damals erreicht – wenigstens durch Grundstückskäufe (50). Das großartige
System mächtiger, von vielen Nebenbauten umrahmter Kreuzgänge entstammt als Baugedanke
also wahrscheinlich derselben Zeit und demselben Kreise wie das vom gleichen Geiste getragene
Kirchenprojekt.


Die Ausführung zog sich freilich über gut hundert Jahre hin. Um 1250 anscheinend Errichtung
des Lauben-Unterbaus der Allerheiligen Kapelle an der Stelle, wo der romanische Kreuzgang an
das linke Querschiff der neuaufwachsenden gotischen Kirche stieß (51). Wenig später vermutlich
ein zweiter Einbau in das romanische System: Ausbau der Passage zwischen der jetzigen
Sakristei und der jetzigen “Spanischen Kapelle” – wohl auch ein Versuch, dem Durchgang
zwischen der ältesten Kapelle und der romanischen Kirche eine monumentale Form zu geben
(52). Gegen 1270 vielleicht erste Anfänge eines gotischen Kreuzgangs: Errichtung des ersten
(von Osten gezählt) Joches des Nordflügels (der späteren Kapelle SS. Filippo e Jacopo) am
jetzigen “Chiostro de’Morti” (“Chiostro Vecchio”), möglicherweise auch des ganzen nördlichen
Kreuzgangflügels dieses Hofes, etwa unter Niederlegung des romanischen Kreuzgangs; um
1279/80 wohl Fortführung dieser Unternehmung: Bau der Strozzi Kapelle und des
darunterliegenden Ostflügels (53). Damit war der Anfang zu dem System von Gängen und
Grabkapellen gemacht, das dann allmählich weiter nach Norden zu ausgedehnt wurde. 1284/
Bautätigkeit in den südlichen Außenteilen: am späteren “Chiostro dell’Infermeria” (Baumeister:
Fra Albertino Cambi, genannt Mazante), in der Gegend der späteren Apotheke, am
Bruderschaftsgebäude der Laudesi (am Haupttor) und an der ebenda gelegenen “Schule” der
Laudesi-Bruderschaft (54).

Um diese Zeit scheint das Kloster noch aus zwei getrennten Hauptteilen bestanden zu haben: aus
dem bereits naugestalteten “Chiostro Vecchio” neben dem Querschiff der neuen Kirche und aus
den Wirtschaftsgebäuden im Süden (55).

Durch die Vollendung des Kirchenbaus wurden nun Mittel frei, um die vermutlich längst
geplante Verbindung zwischen diesen Teilen herzustellen. Man begann mit der Errichtung des
südnördlich gereichteten Gebäude-Flügels, an den sich dann später der “Chiostro Grande” im
Westen, der “Chiostro Verde” im Osten anlehnen sollten: 1303-1308 Erbauung des neuen
Kapitelhauses, des später so genannten “Capitolo del Nocentino”; gleichzeitig wurde wohl der
“Chiostro Grande” begonnen, wirksam gefördert freilich erst später (56). Inzwischen wurden
andere Unternehmungen durchgeführt, und zwar gewisse Ausbauten am Haupteingang und im
“Chiostro Vecchio”: 1318/19 die Schule und die Herberge (57), 1323 die Friedhofsmauer (58),
um 1330 wohl die Kapelle Strozzi-Trinciavelli nahe dem eben damals errichteten Glockenturm
(59). Erst 1332/34 wandte man sich mit der Erbauung der großen Nikolauskapelle, der Stiftung
des Dardano Acciaiuoli, wieder der Förderung der Bauten am “Chiostro Grande” zu (60).

Gerade damals bekamen die Bauunternahmungen der Dominikaner einen neuen Anstoß durch
ein zunächst schädlich scheinendes Naturereignis, die Überschwemmung von 1333. Der Hinweis
auf die dadurch angerichteten Zerstörungen versetzte die Mönche in die Lage, die öffentliche
Mildtätigkeit besonders wirksam anrufen zu können (61). Nun endlich wurde der “Chiostro
Grande” energisch weitergeführt: wiederaufnahme und allmähliche Vollendung des “lange zuvor
begonnenen” neuen Dormitoriums, das wohl über dem “Capitolo del Nocentino” und nördlich
daran anschließend zu denken ist (62); Errichtung der Kreuzgang-Arkaden im Auftrag des
Erzbischofs Simone de’Saltarelli von Pisa (+1344), des Johannes Tuccii de’Infangatis († 1348)
und anderer (63). – Diese Arbeiten leitete wohl schon Fra Jacopo Talenti, der seit etwa 1330 die
Bauhütte übernommen hatte (63).

Damals begann auch eine erneute Umgestaltung des “Chiostro Vecchio”. 1338/1340 im
Nordflügel auf Grund einer Stiftung der Baldesi Einrichtung einer Bibliothek wohl durch Jacopo
Talenti (64). 1340-63 Anbau des Querflügels des Grabkapellenreihe hinter den zwei westlichen
Nebenchören (65). Gleichzeitig (1349-63) Ausgestaltung der Nordseite und vielleicht auch der
Ostseite des “Chiostro Vecchio” (66).

Eben damals errichte die Bautätigkeit im Kloster überhaupt ihren Höhepunkt. Eine Reihe von
fördernden Unständen war zusammengetroffen: die Pest von 1348 hatte die Bürgerschaft an
kirchlichen Unternehmungen überaus interessiert und opferfreudig gemacht; ein hochbegabter
Prior, der berühmte Prediger und Gelehrte Fra Jacopo Passavanti, hatte die günstige Stimmung
für seine Unternehmungslust zu gewinnen verstanden; und ein tüchtiger Architekt, Fra Jacopo
Talenti, stand bereit, den geplanten Unternehmungen eine monumentale Form zu geben. So
gewann das hundert Jahre zuvor entworfene Klosterprojekt in einer Großartigkeit Gestalt, die der
Gesinnung der ursprünglichen Erfinder würdig war. Das schönste Denkmal dieser Blütezeit ist
der “Chiostro Verde” mit seinen Anbauten, dem großen Refektorium und dem neuen Kapitelsaal
(der “Spanischen Kapelle”). – Die bauten wurden um 1344 begonnen; Buonamico di Lapo
Guidalotti, ein reicher Freund des Priors, stiftete den Mönchen einen neuen Kapitelsalal, dessen
Chor ihm als Grabkapelle dienen sollte. Diesem Zwecke wurde die alte Kapelle S. Maria
Novella, die Vorläuferin der romanischen Kirche, geopfert; schon vor 1355 war das
Kapitelgebäude mit den davor gelegenen ersten Arkaden des “Chiostro Verde” fertig (67). Die
anderen Seiten dieses Kreuzganges wurden im Auftrag anderer Familien gegen 1360 vollendet;
ebenso das Refektorium westlich am “Chiostro Verde”, das gleichfalls um 1350 begonnen
worden war (wohl als Ersatz für einen etwas älteren, vom Prior Michele dei Pilastri gestifteten
Bau?) (67).

Im selben Jahrzehnt – um 1356 – entstand auch der große Nordflügel am “Chiostro Grande” mit
dem riesigen, in den “Chiostro Vecchio” hineinreichenden Dormitorium (“della Cappella”) und
der Bibliothek (68). Leiter aller dieser Bauten war höchstwahrscheinlich Fra Jacopo Talenti (69).
Über dem Refektorium entstand ein Noviziat; daran anschließend (am “Chiostro Grande”, im
Obergeschoß des Südflügels) ein dazugehöriges Dormitorium, ausgeführt zwischen 1364- 1383
auf Kosten des Fra Alessio Strozzi (70). Damit schloß die Bautätigkeit während dieser Periode.

Im 15. Jahrhundert folgte ein allmählicher Ausbau bereits vorhandener Teile. 1418- 20
Errichtung eines Westflügels als Papstherberge für Martin V.; dafür lieferten Ghiberti und
Giuliano Pesello Konkurrenzentwürfe (71). Um 1424 Einbau eines kleines Kreuzgangs vor der
Südfront des Refektoriums und Erneuerung der Infermeria durch den damaligen (1424+) Prior
und Dominikanergeneral Lionardo Statii Dati (72). 1434 Umbau der Papstwohnung für Eugen
IV. (73). Gegen 1500 Aufstockung eines (unvollendeten) Obergeschosses über einem Teil der


Loggia des “Chiostro Grande” (74). 1505 Erneuerung des “Chiostro della Porta”: Entstehung des
Renaissance-Kreuzgangs zwischen dem Klostereingang und dem “Chiostro Dati” (75). 1504
wurde die Papstwohnung für Leonardo da Vinci hergerichtet, der dort seinen Karton der
Anghiarischlacht zeichnete (76), 1515 für Papst Leo X. (77).

Wichtige Veränderungen bewirkte Vasari 1563 ff. auf Befehl Großherzog Cosimos I.: die
Papstwohnung wurde den Nonnen des neugegründeten Klosters della SS. Concezione
überwiesen und dafür hergerichtet; die aus diesen Räumen vertriebene Bruderschaft S. Benedetto
Bianco wurde durch Einbau eines Oratoriums und Kreuzgangs im “oberen Friedhof” entschädigt
(78); der Kapellenflügel hinter den Nebenchören der Kirche wurde in einen Zugang zu dem
neuen Mönchschor in der Hauptchorkapelle verwandelt (79). Aus dieser Zeit stammt wohl die
schöne Treppenanlage bei der Infermeria (von Vasari selbst entworfen?).

Es folgten einige kleinere Umbauten im 17. Jahrhundert (80).

1814 kam die Papstwohnung an S. Maria Novella zurück (81). Einige Jahre später erfolgte eine
neue große Zerstörung. Beim Bau des Bahnhofs wurden einige Kapellen am “Chiostro de’Morti”
abgerissen und der Klostergarten in einen öffentlichen Platz verwandelt (82). Die
Restaurierungsarbeiten hatten schon vorher begonnen. Die im Laufe der Zeit so gut wie
vollständig verschwundenen “Avelli” (Grabnischen) in der Umfassungsmauer des “oberen”
Friedhofs wurden 1847 erneuert (83). Weitere, ziemlich eingreifende Wiederwurden 1 847
erneuert (83). Weitere, ziemlich eingreifende Wiederherstellungen: 1892/94, 1912, 1914,
1915/16 (84) und 1921/29 (85).

Der Glockenturm. Sein ursprünglicher Helm war mit einer Kreuz-blume und einer Engelsfigur
bekrönt und an den Kanten mit Krabben besetzt (97).

Der Mönchschor (Tramezzo). In den beiden letzten Jochen des Mittelschiffs erhob sich bis
1565/72 der ursprüngliche Mönchschor in Gestalt eines hochummauerten, zwischen die Pfeiler
eingespannten Rechtecks. Näheres siehe unter ,,Verlorene Ausstattung“ S.734.An die
Mönchschorfassade schloβ sich beiderseits in den Seitenschiffen ein Gitter an, so daß der hintere,
dem Mönchsgottesdienst dienende Teil der Kirche in voller Breite von dem vorderen Teil, der
Predigt-kirche der Laiengemeinde, abgetrennt war.Die trennende Schranke und die gesamte
Mönchschorzone heißt in den Quellenschriften (14.-16.Jahrh.) ,,Tramezzo“ (98).

Die Seitenaltäre Vasaris. 1565ff. an den Seitenschiffswänden errich-tet, 1857ff. ersetzt.
Vorzustellen wie die entsprechende, noch er-haltene Altarserie imn Langhaus von S.Croce. Die
Kapitelle waren komposit (98a).


Der,,obere Friedhof“. Gelegen östlich neben dem Langhaus der Kirche (im Winkel zwischen dem östlichen Seitenschiff
und Querschiff); gegen die Piazza S.Maria Novella und die Via degli Avelli abgegrenzt durch eine
Umfassungs-mauer mit ,,avelli“ (Grabnischen); vgl. Wood-Brown,1902,101f.-Auf dem
nördlichen, an die ,,Cappella della Pura“ angrenzenden Drittel dieses mittelalterlichen,
geweihten Friedhofs befand sich seit dem 15./17.Jahrhundert ein Kreuzgang, der ,,Cortile della
Pura“,auf dem südlich anschließenden Rest des Geländes seit 1570ff. der Gebäudekomplex der
Bruderschaft S.Benedetto Bianco. Alle diese Bauten wurden 1867 entfernt (Grundriß und
Rekonstruktion siehe unter S.Benedetto Bianco, Band I, 354f.), die Umfassungsmauer wurde
damals neugotisch wiederhergerichtet. In ihr befand sich,an Stelle des jetzigen neugotischen
Portals,bis 1847 ein Portal von Gherardo Silvani (17.Jahrhundert; abgebildet bei Ricci, Cento
vedute di Firenze antica, 1906, Tafel XCI; vgl. auch Anm.80).


Das Kloster.
Seine umfangreichen Baulichkeiten sind einigermaβen im Sinne ihres ursprünglichen Zustandes
wiederhergestellt worden. Auf die Einzel-heiten kann hier nur summarisch eingegangen
werden.Die ursprüng-liche Zweckbestimmung (bzw. Lage) der einzelnen Teile ergibt sich aus der
,,Baugeschichte" und aus dem Plan auf S.693. Hervor-gehoben sei,daβ diese Klosteranlage wohl
die allerreichste,die aller-vollständigste in Florenz war, daß sie dem Ideal einer alle denkbaren
Zwecke berücksichtigenden Anlage wahrscheinlich am nächsten kam.Vorhanden waren (neben
den üblichen Bauten) Krankensäle,eine Apotheke, eine Schule, Bibliothekssäle undeine Herberge.
Die Herberge; 1318/19. Gelegen am Klostereingang an der Piazza S.Maria Novella.-Gestalt
unbekannt.

#### *Chiostro Verde.*
Bis zur Erbauung des Kreuzgangs (um 1350) befand sich hier ein Garten, der zum
Kloster gehörte,aber anscheinend nicht zur Klausur.-Über der gotischen Loggia des Kreuzgangs
befand sich später eine obere,barocke Loggia mit Pfeilern und Korbbögen, die wohl aus dem 17.
Jahrhundert stammte (vgl.Anm.84).

#### *Chiostro de'Morti.* 
Hier befand sich ursprünglich wahrscheinlich ein romani-scher Kreuzgang, und
seit der Mitte des 13. Jahrhunderts bis zur Mitte des 14.Jahrhunderts vielleicht eine an allen vier
Seiten umlaufende gotische Kreuzgangs-Loggia (vgl. Anm. 66).- Zur Rekonstruktion der
abgebrochenen Gebäude,die nördlich vom Chiostro de'Morti lagen und hier anschlieBend
beschrieben werden sollen, vgl. den Plan auf S.693.
Benedikts-Kapelle der Tornaquinci (Plan Nr.18); errichtet vermutlich im späten 13.Jahrh.-Vgl.
Wood-Brown, 1902, 99.

_Paulus-Kapelle_ der _Alberti_ (Plan Nr.10). Erbaut im späten 13. Jahrh.?Um-gebaut 1565. Vgl.Wood-
Brown, 1902,100,105,108.

Lorenz-Kapelle der Brunelleschi (Plan Nr.11). Erbaut bald nach 1333 als Simon-Thaddäus-
Kapelle der Bruderschaft di S. Gesù Pellegrino. Umgebaut 1565.Vgl.Wood-Brown, 1902,106,108.

Martins-Kapelle der Nelli (Plan Nr.12). Errichtet vor 1347. Umgebaut 1565.Vgl. Wood-
Brown,1902,106/07,108.

Gebäude der Bruderschaft di S.Gesù Pellegrino (Plan Nr.14). Erbaut um 1347. Gelegen nördlich
gegenüber den drei zuletzt genannten Kapellen. Der Eingang befand sich genau gegenüber der
Lrenz-Kapelle. Dahinter lag ein kleiner Kreuzgang. Von dessen Nordwestecke aus gelangte man
in einen Vorraum. Hinter diesem lag das Oratorium (Plan Nr. 15). Vgl. Wood-Brown,1902,
107/08; das Ganze ist auf der Stadtansicht des Stefano Bonsignori (1584) abgebildet

(Reproduktion bei Mori-Boffito,Piante e vedute di Firenze).

Kapelle der Stigmata des hlg. Franz (Patrone: Alfieri-Strinati). Errichtet 1363. Gelegen etwa an
der Stelle, die auf dem Plan mit Nr.13 beziffert ist. Vgl.Wood-Brown,1902,108.

_Gartenflügel des_ Dormitoriums (?).Ein solches Gebäude ist auf dem Plan aus der Barockzeit
eingezeichnet (Nr.21).

,,Monastero del Capitolo“. An der Via Valfonda-wahrscheinlich im äuBersten Nordosten des
Klosterbezirks-lag das älteste,1244 errichtete Kapitelhaus;darin hatten sich die Terziarierinnen des
Dominikanerordens-,,Pinzocchere di Penitenza“ - 1308 ein kleines Kloster errichtet. Vgl. Wood-
Brown,1902,77.

Die Dormitorien am ,,Chiostro Grande" (Plan Nr.29 und 30). Sie waren ur-sprünglich
dreischiffige Pfeilersäle, ohne die auf dem Plan schon eingezeich.neten, wohl im 16. oder
17.Jahrhundert hineingebauten Zellenwände.-Über die Treppe (Nr.28) vgl. Anm.65. - Im
Obergeschoβ über dem West-ende des Dormitoriums Nr.30 liegt die ,,Cappela del Papa",
ausgebaut 1418-20.

Die,,Papstherberge“ (Plan Nr.31). Eine Folge von Sälen, die die Stadtregie-rung als Herberge für
vornehme Gäste 1418-20 hatte ausbauen lassen.Ge-legen im Obergeschoß des Westflügels am
,,Chiostro Grande“; zugänglich durch die zugehörige Kapelle (vgl. vorigen Abschnitt), außerdem
durch eine Treppe am Südende (von der Via della Scala aus),angeblich auch durch eine
Freitreppe,erbaut nach Entwurf von Lorenzo Ghiberti oder Giuliano Pesello 1418-20,auf deren
untersten Pfosten der Wappenlöwe der Stadt, Donatellos ,,Marzocco", saβ (diese Freitreppe soll
im Westflügel des Kreuzganges des ,,Chiostro Grande" gelegen haben [?])(99). 1434 wurden die
Säle umgebaut und über dem Eingang an der Via della Scala Säulen als Träger eines Schutz-daches
errichtet. Vgl.Wood-Brown,1902, 90ff.-Die Freitreppe ist abge-brochen,die Herberge durch
spätere Umbauten völlig entstellt.

Typus. Dreischiffige gotische Pfeilerbasilika mit Querschiff und fünf daran anschließenden
quadratischen Chorkapellen, von denen die mittlere doppelt so groß wie die übrigen ist.- Da das
Gelände unter der Kirche von Osten nach Westen etwas abfällt, und da unter der Kirche der
ältere Friedhof erhalten bleiben sollte, muβte zum Aus-gleich unter der westlichen Kirchenhälfte
ein künstlicher Sockel errichtet werden; er enthält z.T. Grabgewölbe (vgl. Wood-Brown,1902,
96).

#### _Auβen._
Südnördlich gerichteter gotischer Bruchsteinbau; die Gliederungen bestehen zum größeren Teil
aus Haustein (Macigno), zum kleineren Teil aus Backstein. An der Fassade Marmorinkrustation.

#### _Fassade._
Ihr Aufbau entspricht dem basilikalen Querschnitt des dahinter-liegenden Langhauses: ein
unterer, breiterer Teil wächst bis zur Höhe der Seitenschiffe auf; über seiner Mitte erhebt sich die
Stirnwand des Obergadens (mit einemn Giebel), flankiert von zwei Voluten. Am unteren Teil
sind zwei Geschosse ausgebildet, ein hohes ErdgeschoB und eine Attika. An allen Teilen reiche
Verschalung aus weiβem,rotem und grünem Marmor. - In ihr überlagern und durchdringen sich
Bestandteile aus zwei verschiedenen Bauzeiten und Stilepochen:gotische Teile, die um 1350
geschaffen wurden (wohl von Fra Jacopo Talenti), und Renaissance-Teile, die 1456-70 nach
Entwurf von Leone Battista Alberti geschaffen wurden. Die älteren Teile be-herrschen das
unterste Geschoß der Fassade bis zum Ansatz der Attika. Die jüngeren Teile verschränken sich
am Erdgeschoß mit den älteren; an den oberen Geschossen sind nur sie vorhanden.
_Die gotischen_ Teile. Ihre Gliederung wirktaltertümlich, und zwar fast noch im Sinne der großen
Baumeister des späten Dugento und des frühen Trecento (100). Ihr Vorbild könnte die Fassade
von S.Paolo in Pistoia gewesen sein, eine Schöpfung der Bauschule des Giovanni Pisano aus dem
Jahre 1313; außerdem hat wohl auch die Florentiner Domfassade des Arnolfo di Cambio anregend
gewirkt.-Der Mittel.teil ist durch das Hauptportal Albertis verdrängt worden. Beiderseits davon
sind je vier schmale, hohe Wandfelder abgeteilt, und zwar durch schlanke lisenenartige Pilaster,
die vier halbkreisförmige Blend-bogen tragen. In jedem Wandfeld unten eine spitzbogige
Grabnische (,,avello“) (100a); in den beiden Feldern, die unter den Flanken-mauern des
Obergadens liegen, öffnen sich an Stelle dessen zwei schlanke spitzbogige Portale mit je einem
niedrigen Wimperg. Mit der senkrechten Gliederung überkreuzt sich eine wvaagerechte: zu-unterst
eine ziemlich hohe, reich und fein profilierte Basis; darüber das von den Portalen unterbrochene
Band der ornamentierten Sarko-phagfronten der Grabnischen; in der Höhe der Kämpferpunkte der
Nischenbögen Profile, die die Pilaster überqueren; über den Spitz-bögen ein Gesims, das sich über
die Pilaster hinwegkröpft; unter den bekrönenden Blendbögen eine Reihe von Kapitellen. An den
Spitz-bögen der Grabnischen sind die Keilsteine abwechselnd grün und weiβ.Die weiβen
Wandfelder über den Nischen sind mit grünen Rechtecken gemustert (101); von diesen
Rechtecken folgen zwei Reihen übereinander; die Rechtecke der oberen Reihe enden oben in
Halbkreisbögen.

_Die_ Renaissance-Teile.Wichtigste Bauaufnahmen: Laspeyres, Die Kirchen der Renaissance in
Mittelitalien, 1882, XI;Stegmann-Gey-müller, Architektur der Renaissance in Toscana, IIIa, 11,
12 (102).Leone Battista Alberti hat versucht, dem gegebenen Bauzustand eine antikische
Komposition abzugewinnen: dem bereits inkrustierten Erdgeschoß gab er durch Einbau einer
monumentalen ,,Ordnung“von Dreiviertel-Säulen einen neuen Rhythmus; die darüber ver-
bliebene Fläche gestaltete er als Attika aus; während er so am un-teren, breiteren Teil der Fassade
das antike Triumphbogenschema anklingen ließ, gab er der noch undekorierten Stirn des
Obergadens die Gestalt einer Tempelfront. Doch konnte er dabei die Renaissance-forderung nach
Achsengerechtigkeit nicht erfüllen, da er das gotische System übernahm, in dem dlie Flanken des
Obergadens unter sich die Portalöffnungen haben. An Stelle der (drei?) gotischen Mittelfelder
öffnet sich ein mächtiges nischenartiges Portal mit pilasterbesetztem Gewände und einem
Rundbogen, der als kassettiertes Tonnengewölbe ausgestaltet ist. Daneben sind flankierend zwei
kolossale Säulen in die Wand eingelassen und zwei entsprechende Säulen weiter links und rechts,
unmittelbar neben den (zu starken Pfeilern verbreiterten)grün-weiβ (waagerecht) gestreiften
Ecken. Auf den Kapitellen der Säulen und Eckpfeiler und zugleich auf den dazwischenliegenden
Scheiteln der gotischen Blendbögen ruht ein antikisches Gebälk als Abschluβ des untersten
Fassaden-Geschosses.-Darüber folgt die Attika, eine weiße Zone mit nebeneinandergereihten
grünen Streifen-quadraten, deren jedes im Mittelpunkt eine Rosette usw.hat-ähn-lich den
Zierquadraten über der Empore des Baptisteriums; an den Ecken setzen sich die gestreiften
Eckpfeiler des Erdgeschosses fort.- An der Stirnwand des Obergadens bildet die
Marmorverschalung eine Komposition in der Art einer antiken Tempelfassade, die mit den Mitteln
des Florentiner Inkrustationsstils dargestellt ist: vier Pilaster (waagerecht grün und weiβ gestreift)
teilen drei Wandfelder ab und tragen ein Gebälk, über dem ein Giebel aufsteigt. Im mittleren, brei-
teren Wandfeld das ältere, gotische Rosenfenster (zu tief sitzend);im Giebel das sonnenartige
Jesus-Emblem; am Fries des Gebälks in.groBen Antiqua-Buchstaben der Name des Stifters und
das Voll-endungsdatum 1470; die weißen Wandfelder sind durch grüne Recht-eckstreifen
gegliedert, deren jeder in der Mitte ein grünes Sternmuster enthält.- Als Zwickelfüllung zwischen
der Obergadenfront und dem breiteren Unterteil der Fassade dienen zwei Voluten - zum ersten-
mal in der Baugeschichte, ein Motiv, das sich von hier aus die Bau-kunst Europas erobern sollte.

Die Form der Voluten ist von den Strebe-Voluten an Brunelleschis Domkuppel-Laterne angeregt;
auf jeder Volute reiche Inkrustationsornamente; beherrschend je eine gotisierende Rose.-Das
Hauptportal wurde von dem Bildhauer Gio-vanni di Bertino und seiner Werkstatt ausgeführt; dort
und an dem reliefierten und inkrustierten Fries unter der Attika sind als Leit-motive die ,,Imprese"
der Stifterfamilie Rucellai (Segel) und der mit ihnen eng verbundenen Medici (Ring mit Feder)
angebracht (103).


Langhaus; um 1279-1310.

Dreischiffig basilikal. Gliederung sehr schlicht, in auffälligem Gegen-satz zur französischen Gotik
und in engem Anschluß an italienisch-romanische Baugewohnheiten. An den Seitenschiffen und
am Ober-gaden sind den Jochén entsprechend durch lisenenartige Strebepfeiler Wandfelder
abgeteilt, die je ein Fenster enthalten (an den Seiten-schiffen Spitzbogenfenster, am Obergaden
Augenfenster). Oben an jedem Schiff ein Rundbogenfries, der sich an den Seitenschiffen (nicht
am Mittelschiff) über den Strebepfeilern verkröpft; an den Verkröp-fungen Löwenköpfe als
Wasserspeier.-Die vorderen, etwas jüngeren Joche (nach 1300) haben etwas andere Fenster-und
Friesprofile als die beiden letzten Joche vor dem Querhaus,die etwas älter sind (um 1278-1300).-
An der Ostseite im dritten Joch ein nachträglich (um 1300)eingesetztes,jetzt
vermauertes,prachtvolles Seitenportal(103a)im Typ eines reich variierten rundbogigen Säulen-
Pfeiler-Portales.

#### _Querschiff und Chorkapellen; um 1246-79._
Grundzüge. Die beiden Querarme, die dazwischenliegende Vierung und die an diese sich
anschließende Hauptchorkapelle sind etwas niedriger als das Mittelschiff des Langhauses; den
Querarmen sind ringsum Kapellen von sehr viel geringerer Höhe vorgelagert.An jeder Ecke der
Stirnwände der Querarme und der Hauptchorkapelle ein kräftiger Eckpfeiler von rechteckigem
Grundriβ (104). Um die Quer-arme und die Hauptchorkapelle (samt Eckpfeilern) läuft in der Höhe
des oberen Wandabschlusses ein Fries aus Spitzbogen auf Konsolen herum.Über ihm erheben sich
die drei niedrigen Giebel der Stirn-wände und auf den Eckpfeilern würfelartige Aufsätze mit
kleinen,barocken Pyramidenhelmen (letztere fehlen aber am östlichen Quer arm, wo statt dessen
an den Würfelaufsätzen Blendbogen angebracht sind).
_Die_ drei _Stirnwände_ der Querarme und der Hauptchorkapelle sind am reichsten gegliedert. An
allen Giebelschrägen Backstein-Kon-solengesimse zisterziensischer Art.- An der
Hauptchorkapelle drei zu einer Gruppe zusammengeschlossene Spitzbogenfenster (das mitt-lere
höher) mit einem kleinen Rosenfenster über jedem Spitzbogen-ebenfalls ein zisterziensisches


Motiv (105). Eigenwillig und groβ.artig, daß all diese Fenster durch einen riesigen,spitzen Blend-
bogen zusammengehalten und mit den Eckpfeilernverbunden sind (106). Im Giebel ein
eingetieftes Kreuz.-In der östlichen Quer-hausstirn ein einziges (jetzt zugemauertes)
Spitzbogenfenster und über ihm ein Rosenfenster (107); darüber ein spitzbogiges Blend-fenster
(von Säulchen gerahmt), das das Gesims am GiebelfuB durchstößt (108).
_Die Chorkapellen.Die_ Hauptchorkapelle ist bereits beschrieben; im hinteren Teil ihrer Seitenwände
je ein Spitzbogenfenster, das schon während der Bauführung infolge eines Planwechsels vermauert
wurde (109).-Links und rechts neben der Hauptchorkapelle je zwei halb so groβe Nebenchöre. An
ihrer Rückwand Strebepfeiler, je einer zwischen beiden und je ein etwas größerer an der
freiliegenden Ecke der beiden äußeren Nebenchöre; sie sind den Eckpfeilern der Haupt-chorkapelle
entsprechend gegliedert (110). Um sie herum kröpft sich ein Fries, der den oberen Abschluß der
Nebenchöre bildet. Abwei-chend von dem entsprechenden, aber etwas jüngeren Fries an der
Hauptchorkapelle und an den Querarmen ist er in Backstein aus-geführt und ziemlich reich
gegliedert: zuunterst ein ,,deutsches Band“, darüber ein Bogenfries aus Säulchen und zugespitzten
Drei-pässen, zuoberst ein Gesims (111). - In jedem Nebenchor öffnete sich hinten ursprünglich ein
Spitzbogenfenster; erhalten hat sich nur das unmittelbar links neben der Hauptchorkapelle. Von den
übrigen sind z.T. noch die vermauerten Umrisse erkennbar, über denen sich jetzt in jeder der drei
Kapellen ein querrechteckiges Stichbogen-fenster öffnet-Zutaten der Spätrenaissance- und
Barockzeit.-Vor den beiden westlichen Nebenchören die niedrige Mauer eines nach.träglich
vorgelegten Ganges.

Die Kapellenanbauten. Alle ungefähr ebenso hoch wie die Nebenchöre.Im Winkel zwischen dem
Langhaus und dem östlichen Querarm die schmucklose ,,Cappella della Pura“ (Ende 15. Jahrh.);
vor der Stirn-wand dieses Querarms die Rucellai-Kapelle (um 1303/25) mit drei vermauerten
Spitzbogenfenstern. - Am westlichen Querarm, von den Klostergebäuden umschlossen, im
entsprechenden Winkel die Sakristei von Fra Jacopo Talenti, um 1350/60;die drei Spitzbögen des
großen Fensters in ihrer Rückwand (vgl. unten S. 691) sind von einem halbkreisförmigen
Blendbogen umrahmt. Vor der Stirnwand die hochgelegene Strozzi-Kapelle (um 1279), in der sich
ein Spitz-bogenfenster öffnet.


#### _Der Glockenturm; 1330._
Er lehnt sich an die Südwestecke des westlichen Querarms.-Wohl ein Werk des Fra Jacopo
Talenti. Gleich dem anderen Werk des Mei.sters, der Fassade, wirkt er sehr altertümlich, ja fast
noch romanisch.Sein Vorbild war wohl ein Bau des späten 13. Jahrhunderts, der Glockenturm von
Ognissanti. - Er erhebt sich über quadratischem Grundriβ. Seine Ecken sind mit je einer flachen
Vorlage verstärkt.Aus diesen Eckvorlagen wachsen Rundbogenfriese heraus, die vier Geschosse
abteilen. Diese Geschosse nehmen nach oben hin an Höhe und Offenheit zu. Im untersten an jeder
Seite ein schmaler Spitz-bogen, im zweiten ein zweigeteilter Spitzbogen,im dritten drei von
Säulchen getragene Rundbögen, im vierten eine entsprechende, aber höhere und weiter geöffnete
Gruppe von Schallöffnungen.Darüber ein schwach vorkragender Rundbogenfries als Kranzgesims. Über jeder Turmseite ein Wimperg, dazwischen aufsteigend der vierseitige Helm;er ist 1778 erneuert worden (112),im allgemeinen wohl einiger-maBen getreu.

##### *_Innen._*
Monumentale gotische Raumschöpfung, die älteste in Florenz, weg-weisend für die Anfänge der
Florentiner Gotik und immer wieder anregend auch für deren weitere Entwicklung, hochbedeutend
und fruchtbar durch die kühne Sicherheit, mit der aus dem Schema der burgundischen
Zisterzienser-Basilikaein gotisches Raum- und Glie-dersystem von toskanischem Gepräge
entwickelt wurde.-Ein-gehende Darlegung der entwicklungsgeschichtlichen Bedeutung bei Paatz,
Werden und Wesen der Trecentoarchitektur in Toskana, 1937,7ff. (113).-Die einzelnen Teile der
Kirche werden vom Chor nach der Fassade zu besprochen, der Reihenfolge ihrer
Entstehungszeiten entsprechend. - Einbauten und Anbauten aus späterer Zeit folgen am Schluß.

##### *Struktives System.*

Allenthalben Gliederpfeiler (und entsprechende Wandpfeiler), Spitz-bögen und
Kreuzrippengewölbe. Alle Mauern und Gewölbe bestehen aus hell verputztem Bruchstein, alle
Gliederungen aus grau-braunem,feinbearbeitetem Sandstein (pietra serena).

#### _Chorkapellen und Querschiff; um 1246-79._
Das Querschiff bilden drei gleich große quadratische Joche: die Vie-rung und die beiden
Querarme; hinten an der Vierung die gleich groBe, gleich gestaltete Hauptchorkapelle, beiderseits
von ihr,halb so groß, an jedem Querarm je zwei quadratische Nebenchöre; dieses Schema ist von
den Zisterzienser-Basiliken übernommen (114). Vor den Nebenchören ein Podest von zwei Stufen;
vor der wiederum höher liegenden Hauptchorkapelle ein Treppenpodest von fünf in die Vierung
vorspringenden Stufen (115).

Das Erdgeschoβ (um 1246 - 65): die Nebenchöre und die ebenso hohen unteren Teile der
Hauptchorkapelle und der Querarme. Den Ein-druck bestimmen die spitzbogigen Öffnungen der
Nebenchöre und die zwischen ihnen stehenden quadratischen Pfeiler an den Nebenchor-
Stirnwänden. An der Stirn jedes Pfeilers ein Pilaster, dessen Kapitell sich an den übrigen Teilen
des Pfeilers fortsetzt. Das antikisierende Pilastermotiv scheint aus dem von romanischen
Überlieferungen mit-bestimmten Formenschatz der älteren mittelitalienischen Bettel-
ordensbaukunst übernommen zu sein (116); doch waren diese Pilaster vielleicht als Träger von
(zisterziensisch-gotischen) Vorlagen gedacht, die zu den (damals vielleicht sechsteilig geplanten)
Querschiffgewöl.ben aufsteigen sollten, die aber in der zweiten Bauphase nicht ausge.führt
wvorden sind (117). Die bandartigen, scharf geschnittenen Akan.thuskapitelle haben pisanisch-
romanischen Charakter (118). In den Querschiffecken steigen Eckdienste und an den Ecken der
Öffnung der Hauptchorkapelle steigen Gliederpfeiler bis zum Gewölbe auf;das Schema der
letzteren-kreuzförmig mit Eckdiensten und Halb-säulenvorlagen an den Kreuzstirnen und
pilasterartigen Vorlagen an der Triumphbogenseite-ist von zisterziensischen Vorbildern über-
nommen, aber stämmiger entwickelt (119). - In jeder Chorkapelle Eckdienste und ein
Kreuzrippengewölbe von zisterziensischer Profi.lierung (120). An den Diensten figurierte
Kapitelle-ein gotisches Motiv, das wahrscheinlich aus den Kastellen Kaiser Friedrichs II.stammt


(121). Die Figürchen, die an den Kapitellen hocken oder sie umklammern, sind aber ganz
italienisch stilisiert, und zwar z.T.im Sinne der pisanisch-romanischen Schule (in den
Nebenchören am linken Querarm), z.T. im Sinne des Niccolò Pisano (in den offenbar etwas später
vollendeten Nebenchören am rechten Querarm) (122).-Zu den ältesten Teilen gehört sichtlich die
Allerheilige-Kapelle der Rucellai vor dem südlichen Teil der Stirnwand des linken Quer-
armes;dieser rechteckige Raum, der später in den darüber errichte-ten Glockenturm einbezogen
wurde, hat ein Tonnengewölbe und ein Portal italienisch-romanischen Gepräges (122a).-Im
östlichsten Ne-benchor eine marmorne Wandnische; ein Säulchen mit jonisierendem Kapitell teilt
sie und trägt zwei gotische Dreipaßbögen; zwischen den Bögen und den bekrönenden
Giebelschrägen ein fein skulpiertes Tym-panon mit einem reliefierten Baum, in dem Vögel
herumklettern-ein Motiv der zentralfranzösischen Gotik von Chartres (123).-Die Arkaden,die das
Querschiff mit dem Langhaus verbinden, sind erst in der folgenden Bauperiode errichtet worden
(vgl. unten).

Die oberen Teile (um 1270/79).Von den bisher beschriebenen Vor-lagen setzen sich nur die Dienste in den Querhausecken nach oben hin fort,nicht aber die Pilaster der Nebenchor-
Eingänge,die letzteren vielleicht infolgeeines damals erfolgten Planwechsels, der an Stelle der
möglicherweise ursprünglich vorgesehenen sechsteiligen Quer-armgewölbe nunmehr vierteilige
Gewölbe einführte und deshalb keine Zwischenvorlagen zwischen den Quadratecken mehr
brauchte.In jedem Querarm und in der Vierung je ein quadratisches Kreuzrippen-gewölbe mit
zisterziensischem Rippenprofil.-In der Stirnwand des linken Querarms ein schlichtes, noch
romanisch wirkendes Augen-fenster; in der Stirnwand des rechten Querarms ein gotisches Rosen-
fenster (124); die Arbeit dürfte also von links nach rechts gefördert worden sein.- An den
Kapitellen der Eckpfeiler vorn an der Haupt-chorkapelle weich modelliertes Akanthuslaub,
reichere Profile und Halbfiguren im Stil der Sieneser Kanzel des Niccolò Pisano-an-scheinend
jüngere, verfeinerte Schöpfungen des Dekorateurtrupps,der auch die Gewölbekonsolen in den
Nebenchören am rechten Quer-arm ausgeführt hat (125).

#### _Die Einmündung des Langhauses (um 1279)._ In der südlichen,dem Langhaus zugewendeten
Querschiffswand liegt der mittlere Teil, der die Eingänge zu den drei Langhausschiffen enthält,
etwas weiter süd-lich als die seitlichen Teile, so daß unmittelbar neben den Seiten-
schiffseingängen zwei Wandabstufungen von unten nach oben ver-laufen,auch durch die beiden
Spitzbogenfenster hindurch, die sich über den Seitenschiffseingängen öffnen. In dieser
Unstimmigkeit ver-rät sich ein neuer Planwechsel (der zweite): beim Beginn des Lang-hausbaus
wurde offenbar der mittlere Teil des Querschiffs etwas nach Süden zu vergrößert und zugleich das
Langhaus höher angelegt, als ursprünglich beabsichtigt war; die Kapitelle der Seitenschiffe und
der Mittelschiffsarkaden liegen höher als die Kapitelle der Neben-chöre, und der Obergaden des
Mittelschiffes steigt etwas höher auf als die Vierung (126).

#### _Das Langhaus; 1279 bis um 1310._
Drei Schiffe zu je sechs Jochen von verschiedener Länge. Zwischen den basilikal angeordneten
Schiffen Gliederpfeiler mit Spitzbogen-Arkaden, an den Seitenschiffswänden entsprechende

Wandpfeiler.In jedem Joch jedes Schiffs ein Kreuzrippengewölbe. In jedem Seiten-schiffsjoch ein
Spitzbogenfenster (1857 unten verkürzt). In jedem Mittelschiffsjoch im Obergaden beiderseits je
ein Augenfenster.-Ita-lienisch-romanischer Überlieferung getreu sind im Langhaus zwei Teile
unterschieden: 1. die Laienkirche oder ,,Unterkirche“, die die vier vorderen Joche umfaBt und die
in diesem Dominikanerbau wohl vor allem der Predigt dienen sollte; 2. der umzwei Stufen höher
ge-legene,,Tramezzo4, der die beiden letzten Joche vor der Vierung um-faßt; er enthielt im
Mittelschiff bis 1565/72 den Mönchschor und neben dessen Fassade Gitter, durch dlie die
Seitenschiffe gegen die Laienkirche abgeschlossen waren (127).

*Die Mönchschor-Zone (,,Tramezzo“)*; um 1279 - 90. Ausgeführt an-schlieβend an die oberen Teile
des Querhauses nach einem Plan-wechsel (vgl. oben), aber von denselben Bauleuten. Wie im
Quer-schiff sind die Pfeilerbasen antikisch (attisch), die Rippenprofile zi-sterziensisch-
frühgotisch. -Im AnschluB an toskanisch-romanische Bauten hebt ein Wechsel der Pfeilerformen
diesen Teil des Lang-hauses von dem vorderen Teil ab (128). Das Vierungspfeilerpaar ist den an
der hinteren Seite der Vierung gelegenen, zisterziensisch-früh-gotischen Eckpfeilern der
Hauptchorkapelle entsprechend gebildet.Das nächste Pfeilerpaar ist dagegen florentinisch-
romanisch gestaltet:vier Halbsäulen vor einem quadratischen Kern, derart angeordnet,daß von
demn Kern nur schmale Eckkanten zwischen den Vorlagen hervortreten, und daß eine Vorlage
über die anderen hinauf in den Obergaden bis zum Gewölbegurt aufsteigt-das ist das Pfeilerschema
von S.Miniato und sehr wahrscheinlich auch der älteren, romani-schen,damals erst abgerissenen
Kirche S.Maria Novella. Das nächste und letzte Pfeilerpaar entspricht wieder den
Vierungspfeilern.-Die Pfeiler-und Wandpfeilerkapitelle und ihre fein und reich profilierten
Deckplatten entsprechen stilistisch den Formen im oberen Teil des Querhauses. Schlichtere
Deckplatten und altertümliche, romanisch-pisanische Motive (Drachen;Medaillons mit
Halbfiguren) haben einige wenige Kapitelle an den Querschiffseingängen; offenbar wurden sie
schon während der ersten Bauphase (1246 ff.) gearbeitet, aber erst lange nachher (1279) versetzt
(129). - Den Bögen der Tramezzo-Arkaden ist nach pisanisch-romanischem Brauch ein schwarz-
weiβes Keilsteinmuster aufgemalt.- Die Mittelschiffsjoche sind hier quer-rechteckig, die
Seitenschiffsjoche längsrechteckig - ähnlich wie in manchen italienischen Zisterzienserkirchen (130).

*Das Laienhaus (die ,,Unterkirche“)*; um 1290-1310. Der Aufbau ist hier im allgemeinen derselbe,
doch sind alle Pfeiler gleichgebildet.Ihr Typus ist der toskanisch-romanische des mittleren
Pfeilerpaares im ,,Tramezzo“, freilich den Tendenzen des ausgehenden 13. Jahr-hunderts gemäß
etwas ins Mathematisch-Abstrakte abgewandelt:die Kanten zwischen den Halbsäulenvorlagen
sind durch Abfasung drei-seitig entwickelt, und an der unteren Sockelplatte unter den Basen sind
die Ecken durch abwärts gewandte ,,Zungen" abgefast. Das Rippenprofil entspricht dem
dreiseitigen Querschnitt der Pfeiler-kanten. Die Kapitelle haben grobes, krautiges Akanthuslaub
und unprofilierte Deckplatten. - Die Joche sind länger, so daß sich ihr GrundriB im Mittelschiff
dem Quadrat und in den Seitenschiffen einem übermäßig gestreckten Rechteck nähert-doch ohne
Regel-mäBigkeit, so daß die einzelnen Joche ziemlich verschieden lang ausgetallen sind (131).

Gesamtwirkung und Bedeutung. Durch die Höhe und Weite seiner Ar-kaden und durch die geringe
Überhöhung seines Obergadens wirkt der Langhaus-Raum weit, offen und hallenartig, fast schon
im Sinne der nordischen Spätgotik. Diese Wirkung ist wahrscheinlich durch Anknüpfung an
toskanisch-romanische, pseudobasilikale Räume zu-stande gekommen (132), und vor allem im
jüngsten Teil, dem ,,Laien-haus“,immer entschiedener angestrebt worden: dort wird das Inein-
andervergleiten der Raumteile auch noch durch Abfasung der Pfeiler-kanten und der Rippen
gefördert. Wiederum fast schon in spät-gotischer Weise erhält der mächtige Raum Festigkeit durch
die Ge-schlossenheit schlichter, großer Wandflächen, erhält er Leben durch das Kräftespiel der
gelassen kraftvoll aufstrebenden Formen der Pfeiler, Bögen und Fenster und durch das malerische
Spiel der ver-gleitenden Lichter und Schatten. Dennoch wirkt er letzten Endes anders als die
spätgotischen Hallen Mitteleuropas. Uritalienisch die organische Körperhaftigkeit der
säulenartigen Pfeilervorlagen. Urflorentinisch und zugleich völlig dominikanisch die anschauliche
Geschlossenheit, die einleuchtende Logik dieses kräftig-schlichten,schwungvoll aufstrebenden
Gliedersystems (133). Unvergleichbardie Dynamik dieses in den Dienst gotischer Wölbungen
eingespannten,mit gotischen Spitzbogen zusammengespannten romanischen Pfeilertypus durch
die innige Verbindung mit der gotischen Konstruktion erhält er etwas Drängendes, das die Wucht
der in ihm zusammen.geballten Formenergien erst voll empfinden läBt-kein Wunder,daB
Michelangelo diese Kirche besonders geliebt und gepriesen hat (134).

#### Ein-und Anbauten.

Sie werden in derselben Reihenfolge wie die Ausstattung beschrieben. _Seitenaltäre_ im _Langhaus;_
in jedem Seitenschiffsjoch ein neugotisches Altartabernakel,1857/61.

##### _Kapelle,,della_ Pura"; um 1472ff. 
Gelegen im Winkel zwischen dem Langhaus und dem rechten Querarm. Rechteckiger Raum mit zwei Kugelkappengewölben. In der inneren Ecke der Altar des
Gnaden-bildes,ein Marmortabernakel in der Art des Gnadenbild-Tabernakels in der SS.
Annunziata: eine Säule und zwei Pilaster tragen ein Ge-bälk und eine ornamentierte Decke; das
Ganze vielleicht ein Werk des Giovanni di Bertino (135). Seit 1841 bildet es das nördlichste Joch
eines an der westlichen Kapellenwand entlanggeführten klassi-zistischen Säulenganges von
Baccani; an der gegenüberliegenden Wand ein entsprechender Säulengang, ebenfalls 1841
entstanden. _Rucellai-Kapelle;_ zwischen 1303 und 1325. Gelegen vor der Stirn-wand des rechten
Querarms, über einem Gewölbe; zugänglich durch eine Freitreppe.UnregelmäBiger
querrechteckiger Raum mit Kreuz-rippengewölbe (136).
##### _Gondi-Kapelle (erster Nebenchor am linken Querarm);_
ausgebaut von Giuliano da Sangallo um 1503/08(137).-Einziges in Florenz erhal-tenes Beispiel des für die Ausbildung der
Hochrenaissance und des Manierismus so entscheidenden römisch-klassischen Spätstiles Giu-
lianos (138). Trockene Ausführung. An der Altarwand triumphbogen-artige Marmorverkleidung,
eine groβe Rundbogennische (138a), flankiert von zwei pilastergerahmten schmalen Seitenfeldern,
die unten je eine Statuennische enthalten, darüber ein Gebälk und eine kreis-runde Vertiefung;

Mensa mit Balustern. An den Seitenwänden je eine dreiteilige Bank auf totenkopfgeschmückten
Sarkophagen mit drei-teiliger Rücklehne, die durch akanthusgeschmückte Armlehnen und
daraufstehende Säulen und Zierfelder gegliedert ist (Gerüst aus wei-Bem Marmor, Säulen und
Sarkophage aus schwarzem, die Füllungen aus rotem Marmor; toskanische Kapitelle mit Rosetten
und Eier-stab). - Giulianos Architektur bedeckt nur die untere Hälfte der Wände. Der obere Teil
der Altarwand wurde 1602 im Auftrage des Simone Gondi barock verkleidet (139).

##### *Gaddi-Kapelle (zweiter Nebenchor am linken Querarm);*
ausgebaut von Giovan Antonio Dosio 1575 - 78 (140).-Grundriβ, Aufriβ, De-tails usw.bei Stegmann-Geymüller, Architektur der
Renaissance in Toscana, IX a, 1896, Fig. 3 und 4. Tafel 4 und 6.-Hauptwerk der klassizistischen
Richtung in der Florentiner spätmanieristischen Ar-chitektur, einzigartig durch den verhaltenen
Reichtum der Dekora-tion. In jeder Wand zwei eingelassene Ecksäulen; dazwischen unten ein
Sarkophag (an der Altarwand eine Mensa) und darüber eine Ädi-kula. Dosio hat es verstanden,
diesen michelangelesken, drängend zu-sammengefügten Motiven durch taktvolle Behandlung eine
schöne Ruhe zu geben; er hat es auch vermocht, an den Ädikulen und an dem prachtvollen
Fußboden die ganze Pracht farbiger Inkrustierung zu entfalten, ohne irgendwie überreich zu
wirken, wie er denn überhaupt die einzelnen Elemente - Architektur, Skulptur und Malerei
(141),Raum und Körper, Fläche und Farbe- wunderbar feinfühlig zu-sammengestimmt hat.Pietra-
Dura-Arbeit und Deckenstuck nach römischen Vorbildern, eines der ältesten Beispiele in Florenz
(142). Strozzi-Kapelle (an der Stirnseite des linken, westlichen Querarms, höher gelegen als der
Querarm: über den Gewölben des Kreuzgangs);um 1279.Längsrechteckiger Raum mit
Kreuzrippengewölbe auf Kon-solen; in der Rückwand ein Spitzbogenfenster.

##### _Allerheiligen-Kapelle der Rucellai;_
um 1246 _ff._ - Links neben der Strozzi-Kapelle. VgL oben S. 685.
_Fassade der Sakristei (Südwand des linken Querarms)*. Von Gherardo Silvani oder Fabbrizio
Boschi, 1616 (143). Spätes, besonders inter.essantes Beispiel der michelangelesken
,,Architekturplastik“ im Sinne des Buontalenti.Dreitürensystem mit bizarren Einzelformen. Neben
dem Hauptportal zwei Pilaster mit Bügelbelag; darüber zwei knor-pelige,auseinanderstrahlend e
Giebelfragmente, die sich aus einer um-gekehrten Muschel heraus entwickeln; über ihnen eine
bügelumklam-merte Lünette und als oberer Abschluß des Mittelteiles ein Giebel. Über den
niedrigeren Seitentüren Muschel-Voluten und kastenartige Felder.

*Sakristei* (im Winkel zwischen linkem Querarm und Langhaus); von Fra Jacopo Talenti; um 1350.
Längsrechteckiger Raum mit spitz-bogigem Kreuzrippengewölbe auf(neugotischen?)
Eckkonsolen (144).In der Südwand ein großes, dreigeteiltes gotisches Fenster vom Ty-pus des
Fensters in der Hauptchorkapelle: der mittlere Spitzbogen steigt höher auf als die beiden seitlichen,
üiber denen je ein Auge ange-bracht ist.

### OBERER FRIEDHOF

So heiβt-in Erinnerung an seine mittelalterliche Zweckbestim-mung-das ummauerte Gelände
zwischen dem Langhaus, dem rech-ten Querarm, der Piazza S. Maria Novella und der Via degli

Avelli.Seine dem Platz und der Straße zugekehrten Süd- und Ostmauern sind mit weiβem und
grünem Marmor verschalt. Hier setzt sich die Reihe der Grabnischen (,,avelli“) fort, die den
untersten Teil der be-nachbarten Kirchenfassade schmückt: zuunterst ein feinprofilierter
Sockel,darüber die Sarkophage nebeneinander (vorn ornamentiert),über jedem Sarkophag eine
Nische aus je zwei niedrigen Pfeilern und einem Spitzbogen mit weißen und grünen Keilsteinen,
darüber eine niedrige Mauer und ein weißer und grüner Querstreifen.Dieses Avello-System
wiederholt sich auch an der Innenseite der Umfassungsmauer und an der Ostflanke des Kirchen-
Langhauses rings um den Friedhof herum. Neben der Kirchenfassade und der Kapelle ,,della Pura“
je ein höherer Bogen als Portal.-Das Ganze ist 1847 bzw.1861 ff.ziemlich vollständig erneuert
worden, aber wohl einigermaßen getreu nach den Überresten des ursprünglichen Zustandes (145).

## [HIER STEHT EIN DIAGRAMM DES LAGEPLANS DER KLOSTERGEBÄUDE - S. 693]

#### KLOSTER

Bauaufnahmen. Ältere in der Zeichnungssammlung der Uffizien (146). Neuere Grundrisse bei Wood-
Brown, 1902. - Vgl. auch unsere Abb. auf S. 693.

Vorbemerkung. Die Klosterbaulichkeiten können hier ihrer großen Zahl wegen nur andeutend
beschrieben werden, zumal viele von ihnen schlecht erhalten und unzugänglich sind. Die Lage der
beschriebenen Teile geht aus dem erwähnten Grundriss hervor.

##### Der Eingang.

_S. Maria Novella_

##### _Die Klosterfassade_
liegt an der Piazza S. Maria Novella und schließt im rechten Winkel nach Süden zu an die Kirchenfassade an. Sie be­steht aus einer Mauer, die der Umfassungsmauer des “oberen
Fried­hofs” entsprechend gestaltet und wohl gleich dieser um 1847/61 so gut wie völlig erneuert worden
ist: Grabnischen (,,avelli") und grün, weiße Marmorinkrustation. Unmittelbar neben der Kirchenfassade
ein kleines Portal, weiter südlich ein größeres. - Hinter der Mauer ein schmuckloser rechteckiger
Vorhof. Hinter dem darangelegenen westlichen Gebäudeflügel der

##### _“Chiostro della Porta”._
Rechteckiger Kreuzgang, 5 X 5 rundbogige jonische Säulenarkaden in nüchternen
Hochrenaissanceformen. Seiner Lage wegen kann er versuchsweise mit dem “Chiostro della Porta”, der
1505 errichtet worden sein soll, identifiziert werden. - Wendet man sich von hier zum Vorhof zurück, so
gelangt man durch einen Durchgang, der an der Westflanke der Kirche entlang führt, zunächst in den
“Chiostro Verde” (vgl. unten) und von dessen Nordseite aus zum.

##### _“Chiostro Vecchio” oder “Chiostro dei Morti”._
Ursprünglich Friedhof der Mönche; ältester Teil des Klosters, errich-tet an Stelle romanischer Gebäude
im späteren 13. und 14. Jahr-hundert. Der Grundriss ist durch die verschwundenen romanischen Bauten
bedingt.

Der Zugang vom Chiostro Verde her ist ein gewölbter Gang zwischen der Kirchensakristei, an deren
Stelle einst die romanische Kirche endete, und der “Spanischen Kapelle”, an deren Stelle einst die
vor-romanische Kapelle stand. Breit und flach gespannte stichbogige Kreuzrippengewölbe auf
laubgeschmückten Wandkonsolen; um 1279 (147). – In der rechten (östlichen) Wand Reste älterer
Bauten: am Eingang Mauerwerk von der romanischen Kirche (148); am hin-teren (nördlichen) Ende
unter der an die Kirche angebauten Aller-heiligenkapelle ein vermauerter Spitzbogen von einer ehemals
offenen Pfeilerlaube (dem Unterbau der Kapelle; bald nach 1246); ein zuge-höriger zweiter Bogen
steckt in der rechts vom Gang rechtswinklig ab-gehenden Kapellenmauer (149). – Am linken Ende des
Ganges die _Strozzi-Trinciavelli-Kapelle_ (um 1330); sie liegt im Winkel zwischen dem Hauptraum und
dem Chor der Spanischen Kapelle und öffnet sich mit einem Spitzbogen zum Gang und einem anderen
Spitzbogen zum Chiostro dei Morti; die Bögen ruhen auf einem freistehenden Eckpfeiler; diese Kapelle
war der Überlieferung nach schon vor der Errichtung der Spanischen Kapelle vorhanden, und dafür
sprechen auch ihre altertümlichen Profile.

Der Friedhof; um 1280/90._ Hinter der Strozzi-Trinciavelli-Kapelle setzt sich der Gang fort, unter der
anderen, dem Kirchenquerschiff vorgelagerten Strozzikapelle hindurch (150). Nach links hin öffnet er
sich kreuzgangartig zum Friedhof hin mit Stichbogen auf stämmigen achteckigen Pfeilern, die auf einem
niedrigen Mäuerchen stehen (151); rechts begleitet ihn eine Kapellenreihe. Die Kapellen liegen
ebenfalls meist unter der letzterwähnten Strozzikapelle und lehnen sich mit ihrer Rückseite an die
Stirnwand des Kirchenquerschiffs an. Sie ent-halten Kreuzrippengewölbe (z. T. rundbogig, z. T.
stichbogig) und öffnen sich jetzt nur zum Kreuzgang hin (mit je einem Bogen), öff-neten sich aber
ursprünglich auch seitlich (ebenfalls mit Bögen), sodass die Kapellenreihe wie ein zweites Schiff des
Kreuzgangs gewirkt haben muss. An der Stirn jeder Trennwand zwischen je zwei Kapellen steht als
Überbleibsel dieses Systems je ein schlanker achteckiger Pfeiler. - Der Gang mit der Kapellenreihe läuft
sich jetzt im Norden an einer Mauer tot, setzte sich aber dort früher noch weiter fort (152). -Ober seinem
gotischen Erdgeschoss liegt eine Renaissance-Loggia mit toskanischen Säulen. -An der Nordseite des
Friedhofs steht ein Ge-bäude, das kaum noch Spuren seines ursprünglichen Zustands zeigt. In seiner
Südostecke findet sich ein Kapitell von der Art der Kon-solen des Zugangs, weiter westlich ein
entsprechendes Kapitell, und über beiden (sie verbindend) ein vermauerter Stichbogen: hier öff-nete sich
ursprünglich offenbar eine gotische Kapelle; vielleicht schlossen sich ehemals noch weitere Kapellen an.

- An der Westseite des Friedhofs ein modernisiertes Gebäude. - An der Südseite die Mauer der
Spanischen Kapelle. Zwischen ihr und dem Westflügel ein Zwischengebäude mit einem altertümlichen
Gesims -vielleicht Über-bleibsel eines schon vor der Spanischen Kapelle hier errichteten Klo-sterteiles.
Östlich neben dem Chor der Spanischen Kapelle die bereits beschriebene Strozzi-Trinciavelli-Kapelle;
über ihr die Westteile der “Stanza dei Beati”, eines vom Querschiff der Kirche her zugänglichen
Raumes. - Südlich von dem Zugang des “Chiostro Vecchio” liegt der

##### *“Chiostro Verde”.*

So genannt wegen seiner graugrün in graugrün gemalten Fresken. Erbaut um 1350-60 wohl von Fra
Jacopo Talenti. Schönster goti-scher Kreuzgang von ganz Florenz - durch die Harmonie seiner
Raumbildung und seiner Formen eine der vollkommensten Verkör-perungen des Bauideals des
italienischen Trecento. - Im Grundriss quadratisch. An jeder Seite öffnen sich fünf Rundbogen auf
acht-eckigen Pfeilern, die auf einem Mäuerchen stehen (153). Der mittlere Bogen jeder Seite ist ein
Stichbogen, spannt sich also breiter, und unter ihm ist das Mäuerchen unterbrochen; auf diese Weise
ent-stehen vier architektonisch hervorgehobene Mittelöffnungen, die den Durchgang aus der Loggia
zum Garten in der Mitte gestatten. - In der Loggia sind die Joche quadratisch, die Kreuzrippengewölbe
rund-bogig, die Raumverhältnisse ungewöhnlich ausgeglichen. - Auch die Einzelformen sind mit
erlesenem Feingefühl gegliedert: an den Pfei-lern hohe, zart profilierte Sockel und kräftige Blattkapitelle
(154), an den Bögen ein aufgemaltes (im 19. Jahrhundert erneuertes) schwarz-weißes Keilsteinmuster,
an den Gewölberippen gemalte Zickzack-bänder. - Folgende Gebäude umrahmen den Kreuzgang:

##### _Die “Spanische Kapelle” (an der Nordseite)._
So genannt etwa seit 1540, seitdem sie von der Herzogin Eleonora von Toledo den Spaniern in Florenz als Nationalkapelle zugewiesen worden war (155);
ur-sprünglich diente der Hauptraum als Kapitelsaal, die Chorkapelle als Familien- und Grabkapelle des
Buonamico di Lapo Guidalotti (156). 
- Das Ganze ist wahrscheinlich ein Werk des Fra Jacopo Talenti (157). - In der Fassade öffnet sich (wie
meist an gotischen Kapitel-sälen) ein Portal zwischen zwei zweiteiligen Kleeblattbogenfenstern mit
Siebenpaß-Maßwerk; Portal und Fenster sind ungewöhnlich reich und zierlich ornamentiert (158).
Dahinter der querrechteckige Hauptraum, überdeckt von einem riesigen rundbogigen
Kreuzrippengewölbe, das von vier niedrigen fünfseitigen Eckpfeilern aufsteigt. Alle Teile des Raumes,
der Wandung und des Gliedersystems wirken, als ob sie unmerklich ineinander überglitten, um sich zu
einem weichmo-dellierten Ganzen zu verschmelzen; das bedeutet dievollkommenste Erfüllung des
Bauideals, das die Dominikanerbauhütte von S. Maria Novella zuerst im Langhaus der Kirche
angestrebt hatte, und eine Spitzenleistung in der Raumgestaltung des gesamten italienischen Trecento
(159). – An den Eckpfeilern fein gemeißelte und zierlich profilierte Akanthuskapitelle. – Die

Chorkapelle war dem Hauptraum entsprechend gegliedert, ist aber im späten 16. Jahrhundert etwas
verändert worden: damals wurde vor allem der Eingangsbogen abge-rundet. – Gegenüber der
Spanischen Kapelle liegt

_Der Südflügel._ Er enthält jetzt die Wohnung der Mönche und ist unzugänglich (160).

##### *Das “Capitola del Nocentino” und das Refektorium.*
Beide zusammen bilden den Westflügel am Kreuzgang. Das “Capitolo” liegt im nörd­lichen Ende dieses Flügels; es wurde 1303-08 erbaut und ist
ein rechteckiger, fast quadratischer Raum mit einem rundbogigen Kreuz-rippengewölbe auf vier
fünfseitigen Eckpfeilern (161). - Das große Refektorium, das den Rest des Westflügels einnimmt, ist ein
langer rechteckiger Saal mit rundbogigen Kreuzrippengewölben über fünf-seitigen Eck- und
Wandpfeilern; es wurde 1350-60 erbaut, wahr-scheinlich von Fra Jacopo Talenti. Seine Gliederung ist
der des be­nachbarten “Capitolo del Nocentino” nachgebildet und unterscheidet sich von ihr nur durch
reichere Profilierung der Kapitelle. Die Raum-wirkung ist schlicht und mächtig (162).

##### _“Chiostro Dati”._
So genannt nach dem berühmten dominikanischen Ordensgeneral und Prior von S. Maria Novella
Lionardo Dati, der sich inschriftlich neben den Gewölbekonsolen als Stifter bezeichnet hat (“Leonardus
gene-ralis"). - Gelegen südlich vor der südlichen Stirnwand des eben be-schriebenen Refektoriums,
erbaut um 1424. Eines der frühesten und zierlichsten Baudenkmäler der werdenden Frührenaissance:
Kreuz-gang mit ringsumlaufenden schlanken rundbogigen Säulenarkaden, rippenlosen Kreuzgewölben
und noch etwas gotisch stilisierten, locker komponierten Akanthuskapitellen (Säulenbasen und Portale
zum größten Teil erneuert). Im Südflügel eine breite, feinskulpierte goti-sche Wandhrunnenfassade.

##### _“Chiostro Grande”._
Riesiger Kreuzgang, der größte im mittelalterlichen Florenz; gelegen westlich neben dem Chiostro
Verde, zugänglich durch eine Passage von dessen Nordwestecke aus. Errichtet um 1303/40. Jetzt der
Scuola sottufficiale Carahinieri gehörig.
Die Loggia ist dem (älteren) “Chiostro Vecchio” nachgebildet: stich­bogige Arkaden mit achteckigen
Pfeilern auf Sockeln, stichbogige Kreuzrippengewölbe. Doch sind die Pfeiler säulenartig schlank;
da-durch wirkt der Kreuzgang zierlicher und durchsichtiger (163). Über dem Nordflügel und der
anschließenden Nordhälfte des Ostflügels der gotischen Loggia erhebt sich eine unverhältnismaßig hohe
obere Loggia mit toskanischen Säulen und Rundbögen - eine Zufügung wohl aus der zweiten Hälfte des 15. Jahrhunderts.
Die Rahmengebäude, die den Kreuzgang auf allen vier Seiten einfassen, sind größtenteils unzugänglich.
- In der Südhälfte des Ostflügels liegen zwei bereits beschriebene Räume, das Refektorium und das
“Capitolo del Nocentino”. Getrennt von ihnen durch die Passage, die vom “Chiostro Verde” heranführt,
liegt in der nördlichen Hälfte des Ostflügels im Erdgeschoss ein großer gotischer Saal (um 1333 ff.) mit
drei Schiffen, zwei Säulenreihen und Kreuzrippengewölben. Im Obergeschoss des Ostflügels lag
ehemals ein großes Dormitorium, das heute wohl ziemlich von neueren Einbauten aufgezehrt ist. - Im
Erd-geschoss des Nordflügels ein zweites Dormitorium (164), ein großer gotischer Saal vom Typ des
Saales in der Nordhälfte des Ostflügels; er ist jetzt durch neuere Einbauten entstellt. Darüber lagen vor der Profanierung folgende Räume (von Osten nach Westen aufeinander folgend): der große Bibliothekssaal, 1629 von Matteo Nigetti ausge-baut und mit einem reichen Portal versehen; zwei
Lesezimmer; ein Dormitorium; die _“Cappella del Papa”_ , die zu der anschließenden Papstwohnung
gehörte (165); die Kapelle ist noch erhalten, die übri-gen Räume sind wohl durch Umbauten entstellt. -
Den ganzen West-flügel nahm seit 1419 das _Gästehaus_ ein, das für Päpste, Fürsten und andere
vornehme Gäste des Klosters und der Florentiner Regierung diente und 1563/92 ins Nonnenkloster
SS.Concezione einbezogen und dafür umgebaut worden war (166); von alten Formen sind außen nur
einige vermauerte Spitzbogenfenster in der Ostwand erhalten; Inneres unzugänglich. - Der Südflügel
enthält jetzt das “Museo del Risorgi­mento". In seinem Erdgeschoss die schlichten, einigermaßen
wieder- hergestellten Räume der ehemaligen _“Infermeria”_ , der Krankenabtei-lung (1428 ausgebaut ?),
und ein reiches, ehemals zur Klosterapotheke führendes Portal von Matteo Nigetti, 1612 (167). Zum
Obergeschoss hinauf führt eine schöne Treppe, angeblich von Giorgio Vasari, um 1560 (168). Im
Obergeschoss befand sich ursprünglich _das Dormito-rium der Novizen_ ; es ist später in kleine Räume
zerlegt worden. Einer davon, nach dem Kreuzgang zu gelegen, ist seit dem 18. Jahrhundert reich mit
Säulen, Treppchen und Stuck ausgeschmückt. Dem letzten, westlichsten Raum ist im Westen die
ehemalige _Nikolauskapelle der Acciaiuoli_ vorgelagert, von der in diesem Raum die Außenseite der
östlichen Flankenmauer mit einem Bogenfries und einem reichen gotischen zweiteiligen Fenster zu
sehen ist; die Kapelle wurde 1332/34 errichtet und ist heute unzugänglich; sie hat wohl die Gestalt eines
rechteckigen Saales. Zu ihr gehört eine Sakristei, zu der man vom Museo del Risorgimento aus durch
ein Höfchen ( _“Chiostro dell'Infer­meria”_ ) gelangt. Die Kapelle diente ursprünglich als Oratorium der
Krankenabteilung und war später in die Baulichkeiten der _Kloster-apotheke_ einbezogen.

## AUSSTATTUNG
Kirche und Kloster von S. Maria Novella gehören mit ihrer mannig-faltigen Ausstattung zu den
bedeutendsten Kunstdenkmälern von Florenz. Das Kloster mit seiner malerischen Folge von reich
dekorierten größeren und kleineren Höfen, Kapellen und sonstigen Ge-bäuden gibt in seiner
Abgeschiedenheit und Stille einen eindrucks-vollen Begriff von der gedanklichen und künstlerischen
Intensität des Florentiner Trecento und der Frührenaissance im allgemeinen und des Dominikanertums
im besonderen.
Ein historischer Überblick über die Ausschmückung von Kirche und Kloster während des 15. und
frühen 16. Jahrhunderts findet sich bei Wackernagel, Lebensraum, 1938, 43 ff.

### KIRCHE

#### Außen.
##### _Fassade._
In den Bogenfeldern der drei Portale _Fresken_ ; in der Mitte der hlg. Thomas von Aquin, vor dem
Kruzifix kniend, im Hintergrund die Fronleichnamsprozession, die vor S. Maria Novella, dem Zentrum
der Feierlichkeiten, anlangt; von Ulisse Ciocchi bezeichnet, 1616 datiert. Links Aaron mit Manna; rechts
Melchisedek mit Broten (alttesta-mentliche Parallelen zum Meßopfer), von demselben Maler, vollendet
1618 (169).
Links (neben den Rahmenpilastern) astronomische Instrumente, 1572/74, rechts Sonnenuhr
(Horologium), inschriftlich datiert 1572 (170).

### Innen.
Von der ursprünglichen Ausstattung der Kirche haben sich wesentliche Reste erhalten, insbesondere
Fresken und Grabmaler des 13. bis 15. Jahrhunderts. Eine Folge von Altarbildern der manieristi-schen
Schule in den Seitenschiffen verdankt ihre Entstehung der Vasarischen Reform von 1565/72, die im
Auftrag von Großherzog Cosimo I. den Mönchschor entfernte und die ehemals zwanglose An-ordnung
der Seitenschiffs-Ausstattung systematisierte. Die zugehöri-gen Steintabernakel wurden 1861 durch
neugotische ersetzt. In der­selben Zeit wurden, um größerer “Einheitlichkeit” willen, die Grab­steine im
Boden in zwei Reihen angeordnet, die Fenster mit Glas-malereien des leitenden Architekten Enrico
Romoli und des Malers Giuseppe Fattori ausgestattet und neugotische Blindtüren als Rah-men für
Beichtstühle in die Seitenschiffsmauern eingelassen (171). Durch diese Arbeiten ist die Gesamtwirkung
leider stark beeinträch-tigt worden.

#### _Fassadenwand._
Oben in der Mitte _Fensterrose mit Glasgemälde_ , Krönung der Maria, umrahmt von lobpreisenden
Engeln; ausgeführt vielleicht von Mön-chen aus Ognissanti nach Entwürfen von Andrea Bonaiuti da
Firenze, um 1365 (172).
Westlich neben dem Hauptportal _Fresko_ , Verkündigung; darunter in einem predellenartigen Streifen
Taufe Christi, Anbetung der Könige und Geburt Christi (mit der hlg. Brigitte von Schweden); Schule
des Agnolo Gaddi, gegen 1400 (173); sehr übermalt.
Hauptportal nach Zeichnung von Gaetano Baccani, 1857 ff. (174). In seinem Bogenfeld _Fresko_ , Geburt
Christi, Art des Sandro Botti-celli, um 1470 (175).
Östlich neben dem Hauptportal _Fresko_ , hlg. Dreifaltigkeit, von Masaccio, spätes Hauptwerk des
Künstlers, um 1427/28; der Gekreu-zigte, von Gottvater gehalten, daneben Maria und Johannes; diese
Figuren stehen unter einem Tonnengewölbe, das von zwei Pfeilern getragen wird; vor den Pfeilern knien
links und rechts der Stifter und seine Frau. Am heutigen Ort seit 1861 (176). Im rechten Seitenschiff
Gedenktafel für Bernardo de' Vecchietti, 1654 (176 a).

#### _Mittelschiff._
Obergadenfenster, Butzenscheihen mit verschiedenen buntfarbigen Wappen, wohl 14. Jahrh. (?).
Am ersten Pfeifer rechts und links Weihwasserbecken; das rechte aus weißem Marmor mit roter
Marmorstütze, gestiftet von Mongolieri Bellozzo und Bartolo, 1412 (Inschrift); das linke aus Marmor, 16. Jahrh.
Am dritten Pfeiler links Kanzel aus weißem, teilweise vergoldetem Marmor, 1443-48; nach einem
Modell von Brunelleschi; figürliche Reliefs: Verkündigung, Geburt Christi, Darstellung im Tempel,
Gürtelspende an Thomas, von Andrea di Lazzaro Cavalcanti, ge-nannt Buggiano; Ornamente vielleicht
aus der Werkstatt des Gio-vanni di Piero del Ticcia; Stiftung der Rucellai (177).
_Vor dem Hochaltar Bronze-Grabplatte_ des Priors und Dominikaner­generals Lionardo Statü de Datis (†

Bartolommeo di Giovanni und Benedetto del Ghirlandaio (?).1907 gereinigt; seit 1938 neue
Restau-rierung im Gange (231). Die Fresken sind berühmt als klassische Dar-stellung florentinischen
Patrizierlebens in der Zeit des Lorenzo il Magnifico; sie enthalten viele Bildnisse. Die Identifizierung
einzelner Personen beruht auf Angaben, die 1561 der damals neunundachtzig- jährige Benedetto di Luca
Landucci auf Grund seiner Jugenderinne-rungen gemacht hat (232). Beschreibung (wegen der

#### *Spanische Kapelle.*

Ursprünglich Kapitelsaal und Fronleichnamskapelle unter dem Pa-tronat des Buonamico di Lapo
Guidalotti (306); erhaut wohl von Fra J acopo Talenti, um 1344 ff. (vgl. S. 697 und Anm. 67); 1566/67
erhielt die spanische Kolonie in Florenz diesen Raum, in dem sie schon seit

langem ihre Versammlungen abzuhalten pflegte, als Kapelle zuge-sprochen; seit 1592 war er dem
spanischen Nationalheiligen Jakobus von Compostella geweiht (307). 1733 Bestätigung dieser
Uberweisung (Inschrift vor dem Altar im Fußboden).
Außen am Türsturz Reliefs, Tod und Himmelfahrt des hlg. Petrus Martyr, in der Mitte das Guidalotti-
Wappen. Am Türsturz innen Freskenreste.
Freskenzyklus im Inneren. Berühmtes Hauptwerk scholastischer Ge-dankenmalerei, von Andrea
Bonaiuti da Firenze, 1365 ff. (308). Das Programm beruht auf dem “Specchio della vera penitenza” des
Fra Jacopo Passavanti, Priors von S. Maria Novella († 1357) und Testa­mentsvollstreckers des Stifters
(309). Dargestellt sind in einem siene-sisch-flüchigen, doch florentinisch-tektonisierten Stil: Im
Gewölbe Christus und die Junger auf dem See Genezareth; Auferstehung; Pfingstfest; Himmelfahrt. Auf
den Randstreifen Ornamente und Halbfiguren von Propheten und Hlg. - An der Eingangswand Szenen

die enge Pforte in das Paradies eingehen; in der untersten Zone die Kirche (Wahrzeichen: der
Florentiner Dom - nach einem Modell des Andrea Bonaiuti) (310), davor Vertreter der geistlichen und
welt-lichen Obrigkeit; rechts davon Disput des hlg. Dominikus mit Irr-lehrern, im Vordergrund
schwarzweiße “Dominicanes”, die die Schafe (= Gemeinde) hüten und die Wölfe (= Ketzer) vertreiben.
- An der nordlichen Wand, neben und über dem Eingangsbogen der Chorkapelle, Kreuztragung,
Kreuzigung, Christus in der Vorhölle in figurenreichen Kompositionen. - An der linken (westlichen)

Schriftsteller, deren Bucher Tho-mas kommentiert hat, Hiob, David, Paulus, Markus, Johannes d. Ev.
Matthäus, Lukas, Moses, Jesaias und Salomon; unter dieser oberen Reihe sitzen auf einem
achitektonisch reich gestalteten Gestühl vier-zehn Frauengestalten als Personifikationen des Wissens;
rechts die der sieben freien Künste (Trivium und Quadrivium), zu ihren Fußen berühmte Vertreter ihrer

Disziplinen, zu ihren Häupten Personifika-tionen der ihnen entsprechenden Planeten usw.; links die
Personifi-kationen der höheren Wissenschaften, nämlich von links nach rechts die des weltlichen
Rechts, des kanonischen Rechts, der Physik (oder Medizin) und der vier Disziplinen der
mittelalterlichen Theologie, be-gleitet zu ihren Häupten von Allegorien (die sieben Gaben des Hlg.
Geistes ?) und zu ihren Fußen von den Vertretern der einzelnen Wissenschaften. - Der
Erhaltungszustand der Fresken ist gut; sie- wurden im Anfang des 18. Jahrh. von Veraccini gereinigt
und restau-riert (311). Der Sockelstreifen ist an der Eingangswand zum Teil und in den
Fensterleibungen ganz erneuert (312).
Im Fußboden mehrere Grabplatten: in der Mittelachse, vor der Chorkapelle, diejenige des Stifters

Marmor und Pietra dura von Pietro Montorio († 1584), an der rechten Seite Marmorgrabplatte von
Bat­tista de Burgos († 1591) (314).

##### _Chorkapelle._ 
Die Spanier betonten 1592 den Eingang durch zwei Pilaster und einen Bogen,

Pon-tormo und Feltrini (Grotesken) ausgeführt, 1515. Über der Tür im Bogenfeld die hlg.
Veronika mit dem Schweißtuch; Hauptwerk des jungen Pontormo, um 1516. An der
gegenüberliegenden Altarwand _Bogenfeld mit Marienkrönung_ , von einem Schuler des Ridolfo
del Ghirlandaio ausgeführt, wohl in den zwanziger Jahren des 16. Jahr-hunderts entstanden. An
den Seitenwänden Grotesken, wahrschein-lich von Andrea Feltrini ausgeführt. Alles stark
erneuert, zum Teil von Conti.

#### _Museo del Risorgimento._
Vgl. Guida del Touring-Club Italiano, 1937, 262. - Die Räumlich-keiten bildeten früher
größtenteils die Krankenabteilung (vgl. dar-über S. 699 und Anm. 54).

### Verlorene Ausstattung
#### _Die vorromanische Kapelle_
(vor 983, abgerissen um 1350; vgl. S. 672)

Ausstattung unbekannt. Vielleicht waren an ihr die beiden _Steinreliefs_ mit Madonnen-
Darstellungen angebracht, die sich jetzt im Durchgang vom Chiostro Verde zum Chiostro dei
Morti befinden (bgl. S. 723f. Und Anm. 322). – Auch ein _gemalter Kruzifix_ ist in
Zusammenhang mit der Kapelle gebracht worden (373).

#### _Die romanische Kirche_
(vollendet 1094, abgerissen um 1279; vgl. S. 673)

_“Oberer Altar” (Hochaltar?)_ , geweiht 1094 der Madonna und der hlg. Agathe (vgl. Anm. 89).
Ausstattung unbekannt (vielleicht ein Madonnenbild, von dessen Madonna das alte
Madonnensiegel von S. Maria Novella eine Vorstellung gibt) (374).
_Nebenaltar_ (in der Krypta?), geweiht 1094 den Hlg. Stephan und Martin (vlg. Anm, 89).
Ausstattung unbekannt.
_Grabmal_ des sel. Johannes von Salerno († 1242), des Gründers der Dominikaner-Niederlassung
von S. Maria Novella; wohl Wandgrab mit Skulptur und Freskomalerei, errichtet bald nach
seinem Tode; bei der Niederreißen der Kirche in die jetzige Kirche übernommen oder dort neu
errichtet; 1571 durch das jetzige Grabmal von Vincenzo Danti ersetzt; verschollen (375).
_Fresken_ in unterirdischen Räumen (?) (376); verloren.
Ob _Chorschranken_ vorhanden waren, ist nichts auszumachen (vgl. Anm. 91); ob auf ihnen ein
_gemalter Kruzifix_ angebracht war, muß ebenfalls unentschieden bleiben (vgl. An. 373).
Über die Ausstattung etwaiger _Nebenbauten_ sind keine Nachrichten überliefert. Sie waren wohl
recht unscheinbar (vgl. S. 673)

### Die Jetzige Kirche

#### _Außen._
##### Obergaden. 
In den Bögen des Spitzbogenfrieses Fresko-Malerei, Medaillons mit Halbfiguren
von Heiligen (Spuren an der Westseite erhalten).
##### _Ostseite_. 
Neben dem kleinen, von Vasari angebrachten Kirchenportal _Fresko_ , Madonna verehrt
von den hlg. Therese, von Gaspero Martellini, 1. H. 19. Jahrh. (377); verloren – Auf der anderen
(?) Seite dieser Tür _Grabnische (Avello) mit Fresko_ , der hlg. Zenobius und der hlg. Giovanni
Gualberto, der den Kruzifix anbetet, 14. Jahrh. (378); verloren.

#### _Innen._
##### _Allgemeines._
Charakterisierung des Zustandes vor den Eingriffen des 16. und 19. Jahrhunderts
bei Wackernagel, Lebensraum, 1938, 56f. – Die ursprüngliche Ausstattung wurde beherrscht von
großen Freskenzyklen und dem mächtigen, mit der Architektur zusammen erwachsenen
Mönchschor in den letzten zwei Jochen vor der Vierung. Zu den Fresken muß man sich noch die

Menge der vielgestaltigen Altäre in zwangloser Reihenfolge, der Orgeln, Kruzifixe,
Gnadenbilder und Grabmäler hinzudenken, um eine Vorstellung von der reizvollen Buntheit der
Ausstattung zu bekommen, wie sie sich im Laufe dreier Jahrhunderte herausgebildet hatte.
_Der Freskenschmuck_ nahm ursprünglich viel größere Teile der Wandfläche ein. Das Innere soll
vollständig ausgemalt gewesen sein (379), aber wohl nicht nach einheitlichen Plan; dem
widersprechen die verschiedenen Darstellungsgegenstände und Entstehungszeiten. Offenbar
geschah die Ausmalung auf Veranlassung einzelner Familien. Sie hat sich bezeichnenderweise
hauptsächlich auf die Stellen erstreckt, an denen Familienaltäre standen. Ausgemalt waren alle
Chorkapellen, dagegen vielleicht nicht die Cavalcanti-Kapelle (Sakristei); außerdem viele der
Wandflächen in den Seitenschiffen und die Fassadenwand (380). Ob und wo der Zyklus von
Fresken mit alttestamentarischen Szenen ausgeführt wurde, der von Torino del fù Baldese 1348
gestiftet worden war, ist nicht festzustellen (vgl. Anm. 379). Die Fresken wurden großenteils
durch die Umbauten von 1565 ff. Zerstört.
_Steintabernakel_ komposition Ordnung für Altarbilder errichtete Vasari in den beiden
Seitenschiffen 1565 ff.; ersetzt 1861 ff. Durch die jetzigen neugotischen (381).
_Älterer Fußboden_ , von Fra Minia Lapi (1321-76 im Kloster) gestiftet und vielleicht auch
hergestellt; 1861 ff. ersetzt (382). Darin, unregelmäßig angeordnet, eine große Zahl von
_Grabplatten_ ; 1861 in der jetzigen regelmäßigen Anordnung neu verlegt (383).

##### _Fassadenwand._
Altar westlich neben dem Hauptportal (zunächst den Hlg. Drei Königen geweiht, später wohl der
Verkündigung Mariae; Patrone: del Lama, dann Fedini, Ende 16. Jahrh. Mondragine, im 17.
Jahrh. Vecchietti) (384). Erste Dekoration: Mensa aus Marmor, mit _Tafelbild_ , Anbetung der Hlg.
Drei Könige, von Sandro Botticelli; gemalt im Auftrag des Gasparre di Zanobi del Lama, um
1475; jetzt in den Uffizien, Nr. 882 (385). Über dem Altar (?) _Fresko_ , Geburt Christi, Art des
Sandro Botticelli, um 1470; 1857 ff. In das Bogenfeld des Hauptportals an der Fassadenwand
versetzt, bgl. Dort. Zweite Dekoration: auf dem Altar seit etwa 1603 das _Gemälde_ der
Verkündigung Mariae, von Santi di Tito, gemalt für den Spanier Fabio Mondragone; 1861 in die
Gondi-Kapelle versetzt, jetzt im vierten Joch des linken Seitenschiffs, vgl. Dort. – 1857/61
wurde der Altar aufgehoben und an seine Stelle das Fresko der Dreieinigkeit von Masaccio
übertragen.
_Altar_ östlich neben dem Hauptportal (ursprünglich dem hlg. Vincenz dem Bekenner geweiht
unter dem Patronat des Klosters; seit etwa 1576 unter dem Patronat der Attavanti, später der
Ricasoli; im 18. Jahrh. dem hlg. Vincenz Ferrer geweiht) (386). _Gemälde_ , der hlg. Vincenz
Ferrer, oben Christus in der Glorie, von Jacopo Coppi genannt del Meglio, jetzt im 5. Joch des
rechten Seitenschiffs (vgl. dort). Ersetzt durch das _Triptychon_ , Erzengel Raffael mit Tobias und
zwei Hlg., Schule des Castagno; jetzt im 5. Joch des linken Seitenschiffs (vgl. dort). – 1857
wurde der Altar aufgehoben und das dahinterliegende Verkündigungsfresko aufgedeckt.

_Mittelschiff. An einem Pfeiler_ rechts zeitweise Weihwasserbecken, 1300/02 (vgl. Anm. 414).

_Im dritten Joch_ über den Arkaden rechts und links _Fresken_ , Bildnisse des Andrea di Niccolò
Minerbetti (Gonfaloniere von 1387) und seiner Frau Francesca; 2. H. 14. Jahrh. (387); verloren.
_Bronzgrabplatte_ des Lionardo Dati, von Lorenzo Ghiberti; jetzt vor dem Hochaltar (vgl. Unter
Ausstattung, Mittelschiff).

_Mönchschor (388)._
Freistehend im Langhaus, geschaffen durch Ummauerung der beiden letzten Mittelschiffsjoche
vor der Vierung, nach der Hauptchorkapelle zu offen (vgl. S. 674); ganz oder teilweise mit
Marmor (390) verkleidet; entfernt 1565 durch Vasari (vgl. Baugeschichte). Oben auf den
halbhohen dicken Mauern standen, durch einen Laufgang miteinander verbunden, vier Altäre,
eine Orgel, ein Lesepult und andere Ausstattungsstrücke (vgl. unten). Die Stirnseite (“ponte”)
war anscheinend höher als die Flanken. Das Innere war zugänglich vom Mittselschiff aus durch
eine große vergitterte Bogentür, die “reggie”, die von zwei Altären eingerahmt wurde, von den
Seitenschiffen aus durch je eine Seitentür (391); von einer Seitentür hat sich vielleicht ein
Marmorpilaster im Grabmal des Tommaso Minerbetti, jetzt im vierten Joch des rechten
Seitenschiffs, erhalten. Neben jeder Seitentür außen ein Altar. Die Altäre auf dem “ponte”
standen an den Pfeilern, einander zugekehrt, also mit der Schauseite nach dem Inneren des
Chores; ebenso zwei weitere Altäre, einer auf der östlichen, einer auf der westlichen Mauer.
_Fassade._ Östlich vom Eingang _Altar_ (der hlg. Maria Magdalena geweiht; Patrone: Cavalcanti),
verbunden mit dem Grab der 1300 verstorbenen Stifterin Blaxia Cavalcanti; 1370 wurde dem
Altar auch der Steinsarkophag des damals verstorbenen Mainardo Cavalcanti verbunden (392).
Altartafel, Polyptychon mit der Verkündigung in der Mitte, in den Seitenfeldern Heilige, in den
drei Giebeln Kreuzigung, Geißelung, Auferstehung, auf der Predella Pietà, Kirchenväter und
Heiliger sowie die Wappen der Cavalcanti und Acciaiouli; wahrscheinlich für Mainardo
Cavalcanti gearbeitet, von Giovanni del Biondo, um 1378 (?); 1565 ff. Mit dem Altar und den
Grabmälern in die Sakristei überführt, seit 1810 in der Akademie, Nr. 8606 (393). – Westlich
vom Eingang _Altar_ (dem hlg. Petrus Martyr geweiht, Patrone: Castiglione-Dietisalvi), errichtet
1298, erneuert 1484 (394). Hier wohl Altarfresko, Martyrium des hlg. Petrus Martyr,
byzantinisierende Malerei, wohl um 1298; 1572 in den Durchgang zwischen Chiostro Verde und
Chiostro Grande übertragen, vgl. dort S. 723.
_Ostwand_ (Außenseite). _Altar_ (dem hlg. Thomas à Beckett geweiht; Patrone: Minerbetti;
gegründet vor 1308 (1298 ?) durch Tommaso di Ruggierino Minerbetti (395): Tafel unbekannten
Gegenstandes, von Gaddo Gaddi, Ende 13. Jahrh.; wohl 1565 entfernt, verschollen (396).
Daneben wahrscheinlich die beiden _Wandgräber_ der Minerbetti, jetzt im 4. Joch des rechten
Seitenschiffs (vgl. dort); versetzt um 1572. – An derselben Wand _Fresko oder Tafel_ , hlg.
Hieronymus, von Taddeo Gaddi, 1. H. 14. Jahrh. (397); wohl 1565 entfernt, verschollen. Dicht
dabei der Begräbnisplatz der Familie Gaddi.
_Westwand_ (Außenseite). _Altar_ (dem hlg. Thomas von Aquin geweiht; anscheinend errichtet 1. H.
14. Jahrh. Unter dem Patronat der Guaseoni; 1365 den Alfani übergehen und dem hlg. Markus
geweiht; später als Katharinen-Altar unter dem Patronat der Bruderschaft der hlg. Katharina von
Siena) (398). Zeitweise (1494) stand hier wohl das Tafelbild der hlg. Lucia, von Davide der
Ghirlandaio (?), das sich jetzt im vierten Joch des linken Seitenschiffs befindet (vgl. dort); 1565
wurde der Altar an die Westwand des Seitenschiffs versetzt; für weitere Schicksale vgl. 2. Joch
des linken Seitenschiffs.
_Laufgang_ oben auf der Mauer: Über dem Mittelportal wohl der gemalte _Kruzifix_ von Giotto, jetzt
in der Sakristei, vgl. dort. – _Am östlichen Pfeiler Altar_ (dem hlg. Ludwig geweiht, Patrone:
Ardinghelli; gegründet anscheinend zugleich mit dem “ponte”, um 1300) (399). Altartafel, hlg.
Ludwig von Frankreich, zu Füßen des Hlg. das Stifterpaar, von Giotto, um 1300 (400); wohl
1565 entfernt, verschollen. – _Am westlichen Pfeiler Altar_ (des hlg. Elisabeth von Uagarn
geweiht, Patrone: Macci; errichtet um 31.1.1339 nach dem letzten Willen des Tignoso di

Neben den beiden vorigen Altären eine _Orgel_ , um 1330 gestiftet von Simone de’ Saltarelli,
Erzbischof von Pisa; vielleicht nach 1424 erneuert oder ersetzt. Auf den Flügeln Gemälde
(Lwd.), Verkündigung, von Fra Angelico, 1. H. 15. Jahrh.; 1565 entfernt, dann im unteren
Dormitorium des Klosters, 1790 noch vorhanden (402); verschollen. – In der Nähe wohl auch ein
_Lesepult aus Marmor_ , getragen von einer skulptierten Säule mit Evangelisten-Symbolen; wohl
identisch mit dem Osterleuchter in der Hauptchorkapelle, vgl. dort. – _Auf der östlichen
Seitenmauer_ , im hinteren Joch, _Altar_ (dem hlg. Eustachius geweiht; errichtet wahrscheinlich von
den Brüdern Fra Tommaso und Fra Agostino, Söhnen des Tommaso Gherardini, 14. Oder 15.
Jahrh.) (403). Ausstattung unbekannt. – _Auf der westlichen Seitenmauer_ , im hinteren Joch, _Altar_
(den Hlg. Petrus und Paulus geweiht) (404). Ausstattung unbekannt.

Ausstattungsstücke, die unten S. 747 f. genannt sind, und Anm. 468.

_Altartabernakel_ aus Marmor, errichtet nach Zerstörung des Mönchschors _am vierten östlichen
Pfeiler_ , auf Veranlassung der Söhne des Marco Benedetti, nach Entwurf von Bernardo

1598 (406); im Rahmen ein Gemälde, Martyrium des hlg. Petrus Martyr, von Lodovico Cigoli,
Ende 16. Jahrh. (407). Das Tabernakel wurde 1857 zerstört, das Gemälde kam zunächst in die
Rucellai-Kapelle, dann in das Magazin der Museen nach S. Salvi (408); die Büste ist
verschollen.

_Altartabernakel_ aus Marmor, _am vierten westlichen Pfeiler_ , Gegenstück zum vorigen (Patrone:

steht nicht fest.
_Dritte Dekoration_ , Polyptychon: geschnitzter Rahmenaufbau, von Baccio d’Agnolo, vollendet
1496 (433); Gemälde von Domenico del Ghirlandaio und seiner Werkstatt. Die Gemälde hat

und Benedetto del Ghirlandaio, Mainardi, Granacci und anderen); vorwiegend Temperamalerei
(Teile in Ölmalerei, siehe unten); 1804 verkauft, jetzt verstreut. _Vorderseite_ : in der Mitte

Baldesi, 1676 (439); zerstört. – Ob sich ein _Grabmal oder Epitaph_ der Francesca Tornabuoni (†

Bogenfeld Christus von den Evangelisten umgeben, darunter Hauptmann von Kapernaum, der
See Genezareth, Berufung Petri (441); im Bogenfeld einer anderen Wand Madonna (442); ob
diese Wandfresken aus der gleichen Zeit stammten wie die Gewölbemalerei ist unsicher; das
Vorkommen der Petruslegende macht es wahrscheinlich, daß sie erst nach dem Übergang an die
Scali (Guardi) entstanden sein werden, um 1325 (443). Übertüncht im 18. Jahrh. (444).
