## Sandro Botticelli
## Woman Confronts Liberal Arts (1483-87)

Like its counterpart, this scene suffered damage upon its removal from its original site at the Via Lemmi. The identities of the figures are also difficult to identify, but scholars usually attribute the four figures on the left to Venus and the Three Graces. The young woman, who could be Giovanna Tornabuoni, receives a gift of flowers from Venus.
