## Sandro Botticelli
## Trinity (1487)

Botticelli painted this altarpiece for the “cappella maggiore,” or main chapel of Sant’Elisabetta delle Convertite, a convent for reformed prostitutes in Florence. The penitent Magdalene appears on the left, and John the Baptist holds a cross on the right. Because Mary Magdalene was regarded as the first reformed prostitute, she served as the patroness for this religious order of reformed courtesans.  

 

Mary Magdalene contemplates this vision of Christ’s crucifixion, encouraging viewers in Sant’Elisabetta to do the same. Scholars believe that this scene takes place in Provence, where Mary Magdalene retreated in repentance for thirty years. 

 

Angels surround the cross upon which Christ has been crucified, which is held by God the Father. The Trinity is completed with the dove above Christ’s head, representing the Holy Spirit.
