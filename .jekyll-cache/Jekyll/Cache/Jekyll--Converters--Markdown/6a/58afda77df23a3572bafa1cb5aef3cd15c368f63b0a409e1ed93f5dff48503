<p>Professor Bent has arrived! If we were running in my last post, weâ€™re sprinting now. Of course, a project on this scale is a marathon, not a race. We met at the Innocenti yesterday morning, working with the laser scanner to scan as much of the exterior as we could - weâ€™ll continue that tomorrow. Today, we met again at Santa Croce to obtain high-quality scans of the exterior, which weâ€™ll continue on Thursday.</p>
