<p>Giottino, also known as Giotto di Stefano, was born around 1324 and lived in Florence until his death in the 1360’s, although the exact year of his death is unknown. His father, Maestro Stefano Florentino, was a famous Florentine painter who gained painterly prominence for his naturalistic style, earning him the nickname the “Scimmia della Natura” (“Ape of Nature”). Giottino likely received painting instruction from his father, but looked strongly towards the great <a href="https://florenceasitwas.wlu.edu/people/giotto-di-bondone.html">Giotto</a> in the formation and development of his style. Much of Giottino’s written biographical history came from the writings of Vasari in his second writings titled <em>Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects</em>.</p>
