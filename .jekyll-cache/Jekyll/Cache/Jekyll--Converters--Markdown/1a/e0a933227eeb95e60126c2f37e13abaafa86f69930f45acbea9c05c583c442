<p> Happy Summer Vacation! </p>

<p>My name is Ava Boussy, and I joined Florence as It Was over this past winter. Since then we‚Äôve been hard at work cleaning up the website, models, and maps. COVID didn‚Äôt create the best travelling conditions, so Ellie, Elyssa, and I had to pass on Italy this summer, but we‚Äôre excited to have Professor Bent overseas in Florence scanning away!</p>
