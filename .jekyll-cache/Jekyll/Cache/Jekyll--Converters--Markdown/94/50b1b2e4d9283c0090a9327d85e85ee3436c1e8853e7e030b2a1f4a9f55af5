<p>Weâ€™ve had a busy week here in Florence! Weâ€™ve been working with Santa Croce on Tuesday and Thursday, making plenty of photogrammetric and point cloud models of the interior - specifically, of several of the family chapels. Hopefully, weâ€™ll be able to embed information into these models, to be presented to viewers through some kind of easy-to-use touchscreen interface.</p>
