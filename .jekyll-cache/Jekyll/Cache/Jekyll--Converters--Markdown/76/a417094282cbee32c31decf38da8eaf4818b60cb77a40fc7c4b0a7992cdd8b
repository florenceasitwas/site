<h2 id="andrea-pisano">Andrea Pisano</h2>

<p>The south portal of the Florentine Baptistery of S. Giovanni was originally adorned with a wooden door. In 1322 members of the Arte della Calimala, the Cloth Merchants Guild that was responsible for the buildingâ€™s maintenance, upkeep, and decorations, moved to cover those doors with metal plates that they felt would act as a sign of the structureâ€™s importance. By 1329 this approach was amended with a plan to make entirely new doors for the portal that would be made wholly of metal or brass.</p>
