<p>Itâ€™s been a productive first week back! And, with this blog post, I have finally caught up with the backlog of posts from this summer. You might also notice some new changes on the website! Weâ€™re reworking the home page so that the buildings section is now listed as a table instead of big chunks taking up a quarter of the page - this means weâ€™ll have more space to add future buildings as theyâ€™re worked on.</p>
