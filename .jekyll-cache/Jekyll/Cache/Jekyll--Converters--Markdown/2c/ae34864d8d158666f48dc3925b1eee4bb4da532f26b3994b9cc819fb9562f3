<p>Itâ€™s been a productive first week back! And, with this blog post, I have finally caught up with the backlog of posts from this summer. You might also notice some new changes on the website! Weâ€™re reworking the home page so that the buildings section is now listed as a table instead of big chunks taking up a quarter of the page - this means weâ€™ll have more space to add future buildings as theyâ€™re worked on.<!-- more --> Getting that to work required a bit of tricky liquid formatting, which I am VERY new to, but Iâ€™m pleased with the results!</p>

<p>Alice is returning next week, which means we can begin proper work on the Siena model, since she has a lot of the photographs of Siena. Professor Bent is leaving next week for a much-needed vacation, so Aliceâ€™s job is to work on the Siena model and my job is to update the website and make some changes to the 2D map. Weâ€™re planning on making it easier to get linked back to this website from the 2D map, so you can click on a building and itâ€™ll take you to that buildingâ€™s page, or 3D models. Look for new updates on the websiteâ€™s appearance! Weâ€™ve got a productive month ahead of us.</p>
