<p>So: unfortunately, I spilled a small amount of water on my laptop last week and it now refuses to turn on. Although hopefully it will be fixed soon, it really throws a wrench into our plans because we need all the storage and processing power we can get ahold of in order to get these photos into Box. It also means this post (and future posts) about our trip won’t be uploaded until much later this summer. <!-- more --></p>

<p>We got a lot of work done last week! It was a busy schedule - we met with our friend Giovanni and modeled a chapel in Fiesole for him, a fascinating church that dates to the 10th century and was converted into apartments in the 20th century. We’ve also been creating laser scans of both Santa Croce and the Duomo, and we’re now working with the staff of Santa Croce to integrate more technology into the church; it’s all pretty preliminary stuff, but it’s exciting (and very daunting) to have a real, tangible project that potentially many people will be able to see.</p>

<p>Even with the excitement, working without my laptop is almost impossible for me and doubles Alice’s workload, because the burden of uploading all those photos is on her. However, setbacks can happen to any project, and it’s difficult or even impossible to prepare for them all. The important thing is to roll with the punches and keep trying instead of giving up immediately - now, every day, I go to the computers at the Kunsthistorisches Institut to get work done. It’s all about flexibility!</p>
