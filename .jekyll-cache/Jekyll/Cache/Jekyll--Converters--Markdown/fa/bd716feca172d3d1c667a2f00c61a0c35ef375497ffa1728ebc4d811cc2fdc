<p>This is it for me! Itâ€™s been an incredibly productive month for the website and for our photogrammetry. Alice is hard at work on finishing up the Siena model, while I finally finished the San Miniato model - which weâ€™ll hopefully be able to add to the Potree interior of that model! <!-- more -->Keep checking the (brand new!) <a href="/3d_models.html">3D models page</a> to see what gets added, because weâ€™ll still be hard at work on all of this as the semester continues.</p>

<p>So whatâ€™s in store for the future? Well, I might not be as present for the fall semester as I usually am, but Iâ€™ll be around, uploading and making models as well as updating the site, and so will Alice - we have ambitious plans for completely redesigning the site (hopefully before we graduate!)</p>

<p>This is, unfortunately, the end of such regular blog updates, at least from me, but Iâ€™ll try to continue updating as we hit milestones throughout the year. Keep an eye on the <a href="/3d_models.html">3D models page</a> as well as the <a href="/maps.html">maps page</a>, thatâ€™s where weâ€™ll be seeing some exciting changes. Have a great year!</p>
