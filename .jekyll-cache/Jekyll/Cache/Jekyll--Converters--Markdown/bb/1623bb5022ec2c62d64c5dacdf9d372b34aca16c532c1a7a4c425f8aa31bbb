<p>So: unfortunately, I spilled a small amount of water on my laptop last week and it now refuses to turn on. Although hopefully it will be fixed soon, it really throws a wrench into our plans because we need all the storage and processing power we can get ahold of in order to get these photos into Box. It also means this post (and future posts) about our trip wonâ€™t be uploaded until much later this summer.</p>
