<p> Professor Bent's work in Florence continues with the scanning of S. Lorenzo. </p>

<p>The church, cloister, and library of S. Lorenzo has enjoyed elevated status in Florence since its early Christian foundations. Thought to have been the cityâ€™s cathedral during the early Middle Ages, the site transformed into a neighborhood parish church that, by the end of the fourteenth-century, counted among its worshippers members of the rising Medici family.
