<p>Hello again, Lexington! Over a month later, weâ€™re hard at work again on the Florence As It Was project, this time armed with all the technological aid W&amp;L has to offer. Those final few days in Florence were quite busy - Alice and I were both working on our respective Fulbright application drafts, and we also photographed the archives of the Innocenti, a beautiful space containing records going back to the 15th century.</p>
