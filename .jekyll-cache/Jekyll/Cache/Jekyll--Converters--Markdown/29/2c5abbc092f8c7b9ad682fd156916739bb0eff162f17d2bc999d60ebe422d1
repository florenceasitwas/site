<p>Hello again, Lexington! Over a month later, weâ€™re hard at work again on the Florence As It Was project, this time armed with all the technological aid W&amp;L has to offer. Those final few days in Florence were quite busy - Alice and I were both working on our respective Fulbright application drafts, and we also photographed the archives of the Innocenti, a beautiful space containing records going back to the 15th century.<!-- more --> That being said, itâ€™s not the best space for photogrammetry - the lighting was less than ideal and there are all sorts of very intricate details like railings and books that are difficult to model, but weâ€™ll see how it turns out.</p>

<p>Now, in August, Professor Bent and Dave have successfully modeled the Innocenti interior, merging it with the exterior scan we finished in June. Iâ€™m hoping that I can quickly model the two medallions I photographed and, using a handy piece of software called Potree, stick those photogrammetric models into the point clouds, letting us see what a restored version of the facade would look like.</p>

<p>On the docket for the following week is working on our Siena models, as the deadline for those is in September, as well as resuming work on the website now that I have a working laptop. Weâ€™re hoping to make a number of layout changes so itâ€™s a lot more navigable, so stay tuned for a new and improved project website!</p>
