		<h3>Summer's End</h3>
		
		<p>August 28th, 2019</p>

<p>This is it for me! It‚Äôs been an incredibly productive month for the website and for our photogrammetry. Alice is hard at work on finishing up the Siena model, while I finally finished the San Miniato model - which we‚Äôll hopefully be able to add to the Potree interior of that model!</p>

		<h3>Stitching it Together</h3>
		
		<p>August 22nd, 2019</p>

<p>Just one more week until the new semester gets properly underway! Alice and I are finishing some of the big projects - the Siena chapel and San Miniato - before we‚Äôre once again swamped with schoolwork.</p>

		<h3>Another Week Bites the Dust</h3>
		
		<p>August 16th, 2019</p>

<p>Another week down! My good friend, Alice Chambers, has returned, and it‚Äôs been full steam ahead for this project. Pretty much all week long, we‚Äôve been busy processing these models - the Siena chapel, with all our attention to detail during the photography process paying off - and San Miniato, one of our first expeditions, which I‚Äôve been having a little more trouble with‚Ä¶</p>

		<h3>Marching Orders</h3>
		
		<p>August 9th, 2019</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been a productive first week back! And, with this blog post, I have finally caught up with the backlog of posts from this summer. You might also notice some new changes on the website! We‚Äôre reworking the home page so that the buildings section is now listed as a table instead of big chunks taking up a quarter of the page - this means we‚Äôll have more space to add future buildings as they‚Äôre worked on.</p>

		<h3>Photogrammetry, Potree, and Me</h3>
		
		<p>August 5th, 2019</p>

<p>Hello again, Lexington! Over a month later, we‚Äôre hard at work again on the Florence As It Was project, this time armed with all the technological aid W&amp;L has to offer. Those final few days in Florence were quite busy - Alice and I were both working on our respective Fulbright application drafts, and we also photographed the archives of the Innocenti, a beautiful space containing records going back to the 15th century.</p>

		<h3>Going Out with a Bang</h3>
		
		<p>June 26th, 2019</p>

<p>All signs point to us going out with a bang this week! It‚Äôs difficult to believe we only have two or three more days of work left to do in Florence - the trip really has flown by. This last weekend was a long one, capped by the festival for the city‚Äôs patron saint, San Giovanni - Alice and I were lucky enough to get perfect seats along the walls lining the Arno to watch the fireworks display above San Miniato.</p>

		<h3>Intuitive (And Not Confusing)</h3>
		
		<p>June 21st, 2019</p>

<p>We‚Äôve had a busy week here in Florence! We‚Äôve been working with Santa Croce on Tuesday and Thursday, making plenty of photogrammetric and point cloud models of the interior - specifically, of several of the family chapels. Hopefully, we‚Äôll be able to embed information into these models, to be presented to viewers through some kind of easy-to-use touchscreen interface.</p>

		<h3>All About Flexibility</h3>
		
		<p>June 17th, 2019</p>

<p>So: unfortunately, I spilled a small amount of water on my laptop last week and it now refuses to turn on. Although hopefully it will be fixed soon, it really throws a wrench into our plans because we need all the storage and processing power we can get ahold of in order to get these photos into Box. It also means this post (and future posts) about our trip won‚Äôt be uploaded until much later this summer.</p>

		<h3>Hurdles to Overcome</h3>
		
		<p>June 11th, 2019</p>

<p>Professor Bent has arrived! If we were running in my last post, we‚Äôre sprinting now. Of course, a project on this scale is a marathon, not a race. We met at the Innocenti yesterday morning, working with the laser scanner to scan as much of the exterior as we could - we‚Äôll continue that tomorrow. Today, we met again at Santa Croce to obtain high-quality scans of the exterior, which we‚Äôll continue on Thursday.</p>

		<h3>Hitting the Ground Running</h3>
		
		<p>June 6th, 2019</p>

<p>Since arriving in Florence, we‚Äôve really hit the ground running. Although there‚Äôs been a few setbacks - San Miniato wasn‚Äôt open when we thought it would be, and we had great difficulty figuring out where to get a tessera for our Kunsthistorische Institut IDs - but we‚Äôve taken an astounding number of photos of the exterior and inner courtyards of Santa Croce.</p>

		<h3>Our New Home</h3>
		
		<p>June 2nd, 2019</p>

<p>After days of travel, we‚Äôve arrived!</p>

<p>Myself (Win Gustin) and Alice Chambers, both class of 2020, have successfully arrived in Florence and hauled our luggage up the six flights to our new home for the next four weeks. Although Professor George Bent won‚Äôt be joining us for another week, we‚Äôve got plenty to do until then.</p>

		<h3>A Morning in Siena</h3>
		
		<p>Hello World</p>

<p>Aidan, Colby, and I have been very busy since we arrived in Florence three weeks ago. After finishing up the term in Lexington, the three of us met Professor Bent here in Florence. We hit the ground running and began photographing the Bargello the very next morning.</p>

		<h3>Katherine's Update</h3>
		
		<p>Hello again, world wide web! I have been busily working away on learning the basics of web design and translating Paatz. The Paatz translation has taken me quite some time as it is my first ever official translation. I have been working with Professor Paul Youngman our German Department to untangle the couple‚Äôs particularly convoluted sentences.</p>

As is the case for our whole team, I will be working with various aspects of the project, from writing a multitude of content essays, to working with arcGIS software to populate our 2D maps, to learning how to use drones to expedite our photogrammetry process, and beyond!</p>

		<p>It has been almost exactly 3 months since I wrote my last blog post, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I haven‚Äôt been working on the project or learning about the which necessary foundational steps we need to take for the project to succeed.</p>

<p>So here‚Äôs a quick update about my work on the project:</p>

		<p>Halfway through the six-week Florentine part of the project is as good a time as any to give an update on our progress, so here goes nothing! Sam and I have been in Florence for twenty-two days now, and what we‚Äôve realized in that time is that this project has some massive hurdles in front of it that it must overcome if we want it to become a success.</p>

		<p>Hello all,
Over the past few weeks Sonia and I have begun to focus more of our efforts on the actual user interface aspects of the project. When we meet with Paul in the IQ center he constantly encourages us to think about the technicalities of the program‚Äôs design, and what we can do to make it easier to use and improve the user‚Äôs experience.</p>

		<p>Aside from a period of testing alternate logos, for the past couple of months I have worked on creating simple 3D models to produce a broad map of Early Republican Florence.¬†
To create the 3D models I have taken the following steps:</p>
