<p>Just one more week until the new semester gets properly underway! Alice and I are finishing some of the big projects - the Siena chapel and San Miniato - before we‚Äôre once again swamped with schoolwork. <!-- more --> Professor Bent is here with me today, working on the San Miniato point cloud, so hopefully we‚Äôll be able to stitch together the photogrammetric facade with the interior point cloud - which you can see <a href="http://3d.wlu.edu/model/miniato2.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Beyond that, I‚Äôve been very busy with making further changes to the website; if you look at the <a href="/3d_models.html">‚Äú3D models‚Äù page</a>, there should be embedded Sketchfab and Potree models along with explanations on how to use them - that page will need a lot of tweaking, but it‚Äôs a good start, because we don‚Äôt just use Sketchfab now!</p>

<p>Another thing: we‚Äôve begun adding the Borbottoni paintings to the 2D map. For now, we just have locations - you can‚Äôt see the paintings themselves at those locations yet - but ideally we‚Äôll have it so that you can click on a highlighted street corner and immediately see the Borbottoni painting associated with it, an illustration of what you‚Äôre looking at.</p>
