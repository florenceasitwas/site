<p>The wall just within the confines of the <a href="https://florenceasitwas.wlu.edu/architecture/bigallo.html">Bigalloâ€™s loggia</a> contains a now-damaged and detached fresco that probably illustrated the theme of the <em>Last Judgment</em> that artists like <a href="https://florenceasitwas.wlu.edu/people/nardo-di-cione.html">Nardo di Cione</a> found so appealing during the fourteenth century (figure 1). The painting faced out toward the public from the chamber just inside the entrance, positioned on its west wall and facing east toward the Campanile that Andrea Pisano had recently ornamented with dozens of marble reliefs.</p>
