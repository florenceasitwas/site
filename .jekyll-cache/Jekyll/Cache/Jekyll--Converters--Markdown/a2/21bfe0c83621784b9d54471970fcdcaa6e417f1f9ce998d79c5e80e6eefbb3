<p>Nardo di Cione partnered with his brother, Andrea di Cione, to form one of the most successful and influential artistic workshops in post-plague Florence. Particularly gifted in the realm of fresco painting, Nardoâ€™s works adorned a wide array of institutions across the city, and the famous letter of 1349 lists him (as well as his fraternal colleague) as one of the best painters working in Florence at the time.</p>
