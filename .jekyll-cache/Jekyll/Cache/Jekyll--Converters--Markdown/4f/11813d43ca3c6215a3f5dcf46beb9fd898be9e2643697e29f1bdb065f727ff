<p>Long considered one of the “three crowns” of Italian medieval writers (along with Dante and Petrarch), Giovanni Boccaccio left in his wake stories of all kinds. Born in 1313 as an illegitimate child of a merchant, Boccaccio first studied economics and trade in Naples before attempting a legal career. When he reached maturity he scorned his father’s wishes and pursued a career in literature. Unlike other authors of the day, Boccaccio strayed from emulating the poetics of Virgil and Homer and turned instead to the prose of Ovid, who was considered a more lowbrow author. An astute reader and noted scholar, Boccaccio famously performed public readings of Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em> on the steps of the Badia, the Benedictine Abbey that faces the Bargello, and historians believe his decision to write in vernacular Italian arose from Dante’s efforts to write poetry in the common tongue. He expanded directly on Dante’s compositions and became close friends with Petrarch despite their conflicting literary topics and styles.</p>
