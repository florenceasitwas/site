<p>We welcome our new team members to the group in September 2020. Ellie Penner (â€˜23) and Georgie Gaines (â€˜22) join Haochen Tu (â€˜23) and Elyssa McMaster (â€˜21) as we make our way through COVID infested waters this year. While we mourn the commencement of Alice Chambers and Win Gustin in May 2020, weâ€™re excited to move forward with the project.</p>
