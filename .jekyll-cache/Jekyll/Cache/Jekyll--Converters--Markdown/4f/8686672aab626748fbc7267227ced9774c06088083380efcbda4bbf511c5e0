I"þ<p>Florence attracts millions of tourists annually. Drawn by its history, its art, and its physical environment, these visitors flock to the capital of Tuscany to engage with a place universally celebrated as one of Europeâ€™s most important cultural centers. We work to make accessible to students of the past this city that is, unbeknownst to many, under constant threat from climate events, vandalism (driven both politically and randomly), and seismic activity: floods, bombs, and earthquakes have made Florence vulnerable to outside forces, and its monuments suffer from exposure to natural and manmade forces. Although crafted in an academic environment, this project is as much about the digital conservation of cultural heritage as it is about providing possible avenues for exploration and future research. As such, we have developed tools to help preserve what the city is and to help us imagine what it once was.Â </p>

<p>Three major aspects of this project inherently interact: research, the intersection of data and interpretation within a 2D map, and the generation of a Virtual Reality experience result in a cross-divisional interface as one area both supports and builds upon the others. The information provided within the 2D map sets the groundwork for the Virtual Reality map, which helps users understand the data in the 2D map more completely.</p>

<p>This project has been devised to encourage collaboration nationally and internationally, as many voices are better than one. But our design team notes that software applications must be compatible with the one employed here for optimal viewing.</p>
