<p>The entry for the Bigallo in the <a href="insert link">Rustici Codex</a>, which shows the building and two examples of the services provided by the Misericordia, includes a detail of the audience hall.

<p>The wide opening of the hall allowed the memebers of the Company to administer to the poor and needy, including the provision of dowries for young women and the reunification of children with their mothers, both attested by the Rustici illustration and the displaced fresco originally located on the facade above the audience hall. The painting of Tobias and his father, patrons of the Misericordia, shows the building in active use, with beggars seated on the loggiaâ€™s steps and beneficiaries stepping out of the shadowed audience hall.</p>
