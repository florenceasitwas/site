<p>A late contemporary of the famous painter Giotto di Bondone, Bernardo Daddi (ca. 1280 â€“ 1348) became one of Florenceâ€™s most popular and most important producers of panel pictures during the two decades that preceded the advent of Bubonic Plague. The identity of his master remains unclear, and speculations range from Giotto himself to obscure miniaturists like the elusive Master of the Dominican Effigies.</p>
