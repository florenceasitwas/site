I"¦<h2 id="andrea-pisano">Andrea Pisano</h2>

<p>As his surname suggests, Andrea Pisano came from the city of Pisa, located some 45 miles to the west of Florence on the banks of the Mediterranean Sea. Although not directly descended from the father-son team of Nicola and Giovanni Pisano, Andreaâ€™s contributions to the legacy of fourteenth-century art are no less important than those of his more famous predecessors.</p>
