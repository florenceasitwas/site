Our 2-D map will be based on a collection of maps of Florence through the centuries:
  + Catena
  + Carocci

  + ArcGIS

Our 3-D map will be created entirely by Washington and Lee students, using historical records, contemporary sources, and existing structures in an effort to recreate the look and feel of 15th-century Florence as closely as possible.
