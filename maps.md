## About the Data 

The query service (the magnifying glass icon) in ArcGIS searches our dataset of nearly 2000 artworks. The data has been compiled by the FLAW team and contains 30 descriptive fields for each image. A key feature is the ability to search by multiple iconographic descriptors. 

We are in the process of migrating our data to Wikidata.

Our 2-D map will be based on a collection of maps of Florence through the centuries:
  + Catena
  + Carocci

  + ArcGIS

Our 3-D map will be created entirely by Washington and Lee students, using historical records, contemporary sources, and existing structures in an effort to recreate the look and feel of 15th-century Florence as closely as possible.

## The Maps

### Catena

### Carocci
Guido Carrocci's map provides invaluable insight into the Mercato Vecchio, or Old Market, which comprised the twisting, turning, mazelike heart of the Medieval city. Demolished in the 19th century to create the current Piazza della Repubblica, the Mercato Vecchio contained soem of the city's most well-known structures and art, only some of which survive today.

### Buonsignori
Stefano Buonsignori was a member of the Olivetan monastery of San Miniato in the 17th century. Perched on a hill overlooking the city, his community had an unparalleled view of Florence in an age before satellite
